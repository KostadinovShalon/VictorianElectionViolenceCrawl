{"ocr": "MEXICAN INDEBTEDNESS TO ENGLAND. The modern description of Vera Cruz is far from beitt,, agreeable, nor has anv European ever visited this port without a feulinjr of thankfulness if he have perchance escaped alive from the yellovc fever, which has long made the east coast of Mi-xico its head quarters. Yet, it was at this port where FTernando Cortes first landed, and it was hero that lie set lip the Trite Cross tind; r which he professed to serve, and aided by which, (so said his followers^ he pro- ceeded to enact one of the most romantic characters, and one of the most extraordinary scenes in history that have ever been concei ved or ever heard of.

From that moment fortune attended oil his move- ments. His foes were disheartened by the boldness of the invaders, who were regarded as the descen- dants of the Sun, destined, by prophetic tradition, to come front the east and subvert the Aztec Empire, and he stopped not till he arrived at the Mexican capital; till he had put the Emperor Montezuma in chains, and finally became supreme in less than four years from the time when he took the town of Ta- basco. It was the proud boast of Julius Caesar that the words veni vidi viri,\" were not too concise for describing the rapidity of his Gallic victories We have no wish to detract from Caesar's glories, but cannot help askin if he effected so much under cir- cumstances so unfavourable, in so short a time as Hernando Cortes did in Mexico? The student of history will recollect that the effects of Caesar's con- quests in Gatd soon passed away. Not so the effect of Cortes rapid successes in Mexico. Tiie province continued faithful to Spain til! Is I (I, when the con- quest of the mother countrv by France of course dissolved the connection, till after repeated revolutions and changes, an ambitious Creole, Iturhide hy name, by playing off the royali,;t again\"t the constitu- ti<lllalist party with great tact, became Emperor, on May 18, 1822, though his power onlv lasted about two years, and then Mexico became a republic, which it has since remained, but now greatly shorn of its for- mer extent. There is a difference between Mexico and other countries. As a general rule, s: ites, like human beings, are small and insignificant at first. A collection of families a aggre- gate of societies make a nation, and, of course, such societies do not spring up at once. BI,t \"exico arrived at its full growth at its first commencement, It had no infancy\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdno youth Like Minerva, it was born at maturity, and consequently its later history has been that of constant deciiiit--of continual degra- dation. The reader, no doubt, has seen map s show- ing the size of the Russian at the death of Michael Romanoff, in Hi45, compared with its huge vastness in 1851. A similar map of Mexico would discharge a different purpose. it its great decrease in 1851, compared with its vast size in 1520. Let us see then what Mexico has lost Texas has revolted and gone over to the United States, thereby involving Mexico in a war which commenced April 21, 1810, and terminated Sept. 15, 1847, in the capture of the Metropolis under Santa Anna, the President, by the American ormy commanded by General cott. By that war, not c(?tt, ]i .v t)),,it ivar, not only was Texas, containing 300,000 square miles, lost to Mexico, but New California, with its gold mines, and New Mexico were lost too. Yucatan had already, in 1S45, revolted from the Mexican Government, and thus, thc Republic, as we have said, contains now hardly 900,000 square miles, with no more than six and a half milliolls of inhabitants. These constitute twenty states, the population of which is composed of Creoles, or the descendants of Europeans Indians or natives and those of mixed blood under the names of Mestizoz, Zarabos, and Mulattos. The Government is composed of a Pre- sident, now General Herrera a Vice-president, and two legislative bodies, the Senate and House of Re- presentatives. But certainly something is utterly wronw in the Government, or the people, for the accounts which constantly arrive in lurope would seem to prove that in the colony flourish all the vices\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdall the bigotry-all the ignorance for which Spin, the mo- ther country, is so infamousl y celebrated\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Nay, it would seem that the above vices have become far more conspicuous in Mexico since 183;i, when the several states resigned their separate independence, and formed a consolidated federal republic. A well known writer uses the following words in comment- ing on its present condition \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd U Although in the precarious situation in which ate mott states rising on a sudden to independence from misrule and oppression, Mexico may hope to see brighter .1,.y> a:\u00c2\u00a1d at no distant time, to become a great and powerful nation.\" We confess not to share in this cxpcctaticn, which would suppose it possible for a Spanish colony to become great-a thing; which has never happened, with the exception, perhaps, of the istandofCuba But halcyon days are less likely to come now than ever, as Mexico has ventured to engage in the Spanish game of cheating its creditors. Its debt is twenty-one millions sterling, its revenue is two-and-a- half millions, and the taxation of each individual per head is only seven shillings. which in England is thirty-seven shillings, Y CI Mexico wants to cheat its creditors, a large portion of whom are Eno-lish- men. In 1846, Arrangoiz, the Finance Minister endeavoured to defraud the creditors of fourteen millions of dollars, hut now, we are triad to sav that the English Government is about to come forward to rescue its subjects from the hands of the republican cheats. The ministers of England, France, and even Spain have made strong representations to the Mexican Government on the subject of the payment of the public debts of the republic. On 1 st J ul v last M. Pina y Cueva having offered in the Chamber of Deputies a proposition authorizing the Government to pay immediately such debts as have the sanction of di- plomatic settlement, read a correspondence which he had had with .the Foreign Minister of England In the letter of Nlr, P. Doyle, the British Secretary of Lega- tion, at Mexico, occur the following words: \"I f 1 do not give information to my Government by the next packet, that the English creditors have been put in possession of the principal of their debt, it is likely that the British Government will take decisive measures to obtain justice.\" The French and even the Spanish ministers are no less resolved. It has come to this, that the Mexican debt is in no better position than that of Venezuela. Now that the bondholders havk kindly consented to a reduction of interest to three from five per cent., remittances have proportionably declined, and general difficulties have sprung up to discourage those who exhibit a disposition to invest in the stock. It is stated that the resources of the state have proportionately declined, that the agpect of its political relation is more doubtful. But are foreign bona fide creditors to be put off with excuses like these? If in private life a man cannot pay his debts, the creditors have a right to seize his goods. Why should a state be exempt from this liability? We trust that Lord Palmerston will show no more favour to repudiating and bankrupt Mexico than he did to Greece, and strongly recommend him, in the event of the regular army refusing to coerce the iisol, vent republicans, to send over a whole posse of sheriff's officers provided with heaps of fi fas antt-cd sas, commanded by Messrs.

{"ocr": "THE AMERICAN PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. The Iessage was delivered on the 4th inst., at Wash- ington. The leading recommendations are as follows:- Mutual reproach and recrimination, leading to useless irritation among the several members of thc Union, should be avoided and deprecated. \"All laws, while they exist, must be enforced and obeyed, whether popular or obnoxious. The President must see the law enforced, without exception or discrimi- nation. If any Act should pass both Houses of Congress which should appear to him unconstitutional, or an en- croachment ,m the just rights of other departmcnt8, or provisions hastily adopted and likely to produce conse- quences injurious and unforseen, he will consider it his duty to apply the veto power confided to him by the con- 8titution, and arrest it. Foreign relations generally are amicable and satis- factory. With Portugal, Brazil, Chili, Peru, and the Hawaiian kingdom, they are improved or improving. Mexico is being importuned to grant a more unrestricted right of way for a railroad across the hthmus of lehuan- tepec; and the Presideut hopes he shall arrango with Great Britain respecting the ocean ship-canal through Nicaragua, \"A tieatv has been ratified by the United States and Great Britain for falicitating and constructing II ship- canal to connect the Atlantic with the Pacific at tluit point; and but two objects in conuexion with it remain to be accomplished.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdviz., the designation and establish- ment of a free port at each end of the canal, and fixing a distance from each shore within which belligerent opera- tions shall not be carried on, \"The receipts into the Treasury during the fiscal year which dosed with June last were uearty 47i millions. The federal revenue should be raised mainly by du- ties col imports. Those duties should be so levied as to benefit ineillentally home industry.by shielding it from destructive foreign competition. They should not be exorbitant, but modeiate; should be specific as far as possibte and, whenever lid valorem rates are tolerated, they should be computed on the home, instead of the foreign valuation. Mr. Fillmore recommends that California have a branch mint, and meantime gold stamped by the United States assayer should be received in payment. \"An efficient agricultural bureau should be at once created. The Mexican land titles in California should be promptly adjudicated, and the laud laws extended to Utah and New Mexico. The gold lands should be sold in small quantities. The Message further recommends the organization of one or more regiments of mountain mcn for the protcction of the frontiers in New Mexico and south of it, to help to keep the Indians of Mexico within bounds; also that a law be passed authorising oiffcers of army and navy to be retired from the service when incompetent to perform its vigorous and active duties, taking care to make suitable provision for those who have faithfully served the country by awarding distinctions, and by retaining in appropriate commands those who have been conspicuous for good conduct.

Great excitement still prevailed throughout the large cities of the United States 111 reference to the Cuban inva- sion. Meet ings have been daily held, and resolutions adopted, denouncing the proceedings of the Spaniards. Several of the New Orleans rwters had been arrested and committed to prison.

In is averted that another and very fonniehhlc expedi- tion is fitting ont from various point', and that another descent will shortly be made. Several Hungarians have left Montgomery, Alabama, for the purpose of joining Lopez. Letters received in New Orleans from the Cuban in- vaders who were taken prisoners, written a slioi-t tiiiie previous to their execution, are unanimous in stating that Lopez had deceived them. The Canadian Parliament closed its session on the :!0th nit.

The military were called out, and several persons were killed and wounded before the disturbance was quelled. The two vessels which recently sailed from New Orleans, under protest, for Tehuantepec, have been seized b the Mexican authorities at Coatzacoalcos. Great distress is prevailing iu Northern Mexico. The crops have failed,and the stock is perishing for want of water and pasture. The Indians are ravaging the country.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY. I The Steam-ship Canada arrived at Liverpool on Monday morning from New York and Halifax. The California Bill had received the formal sanction of the Legislature. A Bill establishing a territorial Government in New Mexico had also passed. On the 6th instant President Fillmore addressed to the Houses of Congress a long and important Message on the question of New Mexico, accompanied by an official letter from Mr. Webster, as Secretary of State, to the Governor of Texas, replying to that Minister's letter on the boundary dispute of Texas. The President shows that his duty requires him to maintain the status QUO, and guard New Mexico against the encroachments of Texas, until Congress shall have decided the question of boundary. That question he does not judge it is enough for him to know that Texas never had posses- sion of New Mexico, that the United States conquered it, and that the treaty of peace with Mexico bound the Union to protect the people of the territory and confcr on them the rights of American citizens. Moreover, the United States have claims upon the unoccupied lands in the territory which are not consistent with its aban- donment to Texas, and on these grounds, the President in firm, yet temperate, language announces his deter- mination to prevent and suppress any hostile demon- strations agai.ist New Mexico on the part of Texas. At the same time l.e urges upon Congress the duty and necessity of promptly settling the boundary question and putting a peaceful end to the contest. On the 9til the Senate approved, by a majority, the Hill introduced by Mr. Pierce, giving Texas 10,000,000 dolls, as indemnity, with a line altogether more favourable than that proposed by the Compromise Bill. The formation of the Cabinet was completed, the War Department having been accepted by Mr. Conrad, and the Secre- taryship of the Interior by the Hon. Mr. M'Kennan. Some conversation had taken place in Congress relative to the formation of a steam line between New York and Mexico. It is reported that the President had re- ceived information of another expedition against Cuba being projected stringent precautions had consequently been adopted. The dispute relative to the Portuguese indemnity had assumed a more favourable aspect, negotiations having been entered into with Senhor de Figonier, the Portuguese Minister at Washington. Advices from Toronto of the 10th inst. report that on that day the Canadian Parliament had been pro- rogued by the Governor-General in person. His Ex- cellency delivered a long speech, assenting to the various Bills, and congratulating the Members on their loyalty, &c. Previously a disgraceful scene had been witnessed in the chamber. A majority of the memhers were drunk, and they amused themselves by pelting each other with paper pellets. One of the honourable gentlemen, more intoxicated than the rest, caused some consternation by seizing an inkstand, as if with the determination to use it as a missile in the new phasis of legislatorial strife. During this scene, the sober and the least intoxicated portion of the members were diverting themselves by passing bills with extraordinary speed. Sir George Simpson, of the Hudson's Bay Company, arrived at Lachine from a tour through the territories of the company. Sir George brought no intelligence from the arctic regions relative to Sir John Franklin. Lieutenant PuDcn, of the boat expedition along the north coast, had wintered at Great Slave Lake, and would proceed in the summer to rq&ew his explorations. Several new railway enterprises were on foot, intended to facilitate trade with the far west of Canada. From Mexico we learn that the cholera was still raging. The Minister of Finance had resigned, and the treasury was in a low state. At California affairs were satisfactory. San Francisco was rapidly recovering from the late tire,and the build- ings erected were mostly fire-proof. Businesswas dull for the moment, but there was no doubt of its revival as the season advanced. No further trouble had been ex- perienced with the foreign miners, who refused to pay the taxes levied on them, and the people agreed gat they were right. The collectors no longer endeavoured to enforce payment. A good deal of complaint is made at the delav of Congress but the assertion that Cali- fornia would set up for herself independent of the United States, is repelled in public meetings and by several of the journals. A good deal of excitement had been caused by a report at Marysville and Sacra- mento City of a place called Gold Lake, where gold could be procured with ease in unheard of abundance, but the adventurers who set out wandered vainly in search. The diggings generally were not yielding much, the water being high in many places. A salt spring has been discovered about fifteen miles west of Sonora, and near the Tuolomne River. Several murders have been committed in various diggings, but otherwise good order has been maintained. Coal of good quality had been found in California and Oregon. The popu- lation of the State was reckoned at 121,000. The health of the country was generally good. The screw steam-ship Sarah Sands had arrived at Panama from San Francisco, with 1:50,000 in gold dust on freight. Havannah accounts mention that on the 6th inst. seven of the American prisoners were to be released the remaining three had been sentenced to eight years in a chain gang, Differences have arisen between the United States and Spain on account of the alleged arbitrary seizure and imprisonment of several American citizens by the Government of Cuba, on suspicion of their havingbeen connected with the Lopez expedition. The United States has remonstrated with the Spanish Government in language of unusual energy. I the citizens incarcerated in Cuba are not speedily liberated, it is thought that the natives of the Havannah will have a good chance of seeing a more formidable de- monstration than that of Lopez, in the shape of an American squadron. Advices from Valparaiso ofJuly 7, furnish the mes- age of the President of the Chilian Republic on the assembling of Congress from which the following are translated extracts The renewal of our treaty with the United States of America, which has now expired, is a subject which will occupy the immediate attention of this Government. I propose introducing in it modi- fications, demanded, in my opinion, by the interests of both nations. As yet the discussion in Washington of the most important of the claims for indemnification made by the United States against the Republic of Chili, has not terminated. I doubt not we will soon obtain the definitive answer of that Government, and that it will be such es we have reason to expect from its intelligence and justice. The other claims will successively- occupy the attention of both Govern- ments. Means have been repeatedly taken for the protection or succour of Chilian citizens in California, and for the security and regularity of correspondence with that country. The residence in Santiago of an astronomical expedition from the United States, has, through the liberal offer of its distinguished chief, given an opportunity to the Government of commenc- ing the cultivation of a scientific branch hitherto un- known amongst us, and which, aside from its useful applications to objects of public utility, will place Chili, from her southern position, and the serenity of her sky, in a situation to contribute somewhat to the general advancement of science.\" There are direct accounts of April 20 from Port Phillip. The colony was progressing very favourably, and all it wanted, to become greatly prosperous, was entire independence of Sydney. There was still a want of labourers. The Austrian Cabinet has now given its adhesion to the London protocol of the 2nd of August, relative to the Danish question. The French Government, in concert with England and Russia, is about to send a special envoy to Copenhagen. There is, therefore, some probability of the sanguinary struggle in the North being being brought to a close by mediation. The Prussian Government has refused the invitation of Austria to join in the reconstruction of the German Diet. Austria, however, is resolved to proceed and on the 1st of September the restricted Diet is to meet. France is watching with great interest the political movements in Germany, an d is said to be throwing her influence into the Austrian scale. Advices from the Cape of Good Hope to the 16th June announce the discovery of large deposits of guano on Dassen Island, by a Mr. E. Cheappine, but which, being on public lands, is claimed by the Government. An important improvement in the harbour of Table Bay was under consideration, by the construction of a breakwater.", "word": "1", "description": "\u2026FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY.

{"ocr": "AMERICAN NEWS. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. LIVERPOOL, Tuesday Morning, 10 o'clock.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe British and North American Royal Mail steam-ship Niagara has just entered the Mersey, with the latest news from New York. She left on the 4th inst. The Niagara has encountered heavy gales, which accounts, in some measure, for her lengthened passige. By this arrival we have the President's Message, as delivered on the 4th inst., at Washington. The leading recommendations of the President's Mes- jige are as follows:- Mutual reproach and recrimination, leading to useless irritation among the several members of the Union, should be avoided and deprecated. All laws, while they exist, must be enforced and obeyed, whether popular or obnoxious. The President must see the law enforced, without exception or discrimi nation. If any Act should pass both Houses of Congress which should appear to him unconstitutional, or an encroachment on the just rights of other departments, or provisions hastily adopted and likely to produce con- sequences injurious and unforeseen, he will consider it his duty to apply the veto power confided to him by the constitution, and arrest it. Foreign relations generally are amicable and satisfac- tory. With Portugal, Brazil, Chili, Peru, and the Hawaiian kingdom, they are improved or improving. Mexico is being importuned to grant a more unrestricted right of way for a railroad across the Isthmus of Te- huantepec and the President hopes he shall arrange with Great Britain respecting the ocean ship-canal, through Nicaragua. He says that a treaty has been ratified by the United States and Great Britain for facilitating and constructing a ship-canal to connect the Atlantic with the Pacific at that point and but two objects in con- nexion with it, remain to be accomplished,-viz., the designation and establishment of a free port at each end of the canal, and fixing a distance from each shore within which belligerent operations shall notj be car- ried on. \"The receipts into the Treasury during the fiscal year which closed with June last were nearly 47 j millions of dollars. The federal revenue should be raised mainly by duties on imports. Those duties should be so levied as to benefit incidentally home industry, by shielding it from destructive foreign competition. They should not be exorbitant, but moderate should be specific as far as possible and, whenever ad valorem rates are tolera- ted, they should be computed on the home, instead of the foreign valuation. Mr. Fillmore recommends that California have a branch mitit, and meantime gold stamped by the United States assayer should be received in payment. An efficient agricultural bureau should be at once created. \"The Mexican land titles in C.difrona should be promptly adjudicated, and the land laws extended to Utak and New Mexico. The gold lands should be sold in small quantities. The Message further recommends the organization of one or more regiments of mountain men for the pro- tection of the frontiers in New Mexico and south of it, to help to keep the Indians of Mexico within bounds also that a law be passed authorising officers of army and navy to be retired from the service when incompe- tent to perform it vigorous and active duties, taking care to make suitable provision for those who have faith- fully served the country by awarding distinctions, and by retaining in appropriate commands those who have been conspicious for good conduct. A revision of the naval code is rendered necessary by the recent abolition of flogging. The Post office department has cleared 340,000 dollars the past year and the Postmaster-General and President unite in recommending a reduction of the rates of postage to 3 cents for pre-paid and a cents for unpaid letters, no matter what distance conveyed, with some reduction on printed matter also. The Message recommends, also, river and harbour improvements, lighthouses, &c. and a prompt and disinterested tribunal to adjudicate all claims on the Government. \"Lastly, the president is in favour of the fixed mea- sures of the late session, Fugitive Slave Law included. He says we have, by these Acts, been rescued from a wide and boundkss agitation.\" This Message is looked upon as a quiet, sensible document, but not an important one. The Franklin steamer reached Southampton on Wed- nesday morning, with papers from New York of the 6th inst. There is no political news of consequence by this arrival, and the commercial intelligence is of much the same complexion as that brought by the Niagara. We regret to learn that the Helena Sloinan, steam-ship, which left Southampton, on the 1st ult., was totally lost on her voyage to New York. She had been beating about in great distress for eight days, when she was discovered by Captain Hovey, of the American packet Devonshire, who, with his crew, rendered every possible assistance to those on board, which consisted of ISOk per- sons, 175 of whom he removed to his own vessel in per- fect safety. Five, however, of the passengers were unfortunately drowned; and we grieve to add that four of the crew of the Devonshire, in their humane en. deavours to save their fellow creatures from a watery grave, met unhappily, with that sad fate themselves.", "word": "861", "description": "\u2026 satisfac- tory.

The funeral of the late President took place on Saturday, July 13. The occasion was honoured with appropriate and impressive so- lemnities the military escort was commanded by the veteran General Scott. In the principal cities of the Union the day was observed by suspension of business and suitable ceremonies. On the 10th in the Senate a warm eulogium was delivered by Mr. Webster upon the character of the deceased magistrate, and on the 16th Mr. Webster gave notice of a bill to erect a monument to the President in Washington. Strong hopes were entertained that the com- promise Slavery Bill would meet with the assen t of the Senate and the Lower House. It was anticipated that Congress would shortly adjourn on the question of the new Cabinet and the policy of the President. The New York Courier of the 17th says The members of the Cabinet have con- sented, at the President's request, to remain in office till Monday next. It is probable that a new Cabinet will be organised by that time if not, Mr. Ewing, the Secretary of the Interior, will probably be retained. The Cabinet de- clines to advise the President in reference to the new organi- sation, although invited so to do. Their functions they now consider executive simply, not advisory.

THE KAFFIR WA 11. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdPLYMOUTH, Friday Morning, j \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Prepnntis, Captain Glover, with the mails from the Cape of Good Hope, Sierra Leone, and St. Vincent, arrived at midnight. By this arrival we have news I'tom the scat of war to the 28th of October, and we are glad to be able to report it as on the whole more encnuragiug than usuai \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 'for though General Somerset had not succeeded in completely expelling the Kaffirs from the Water Kloof alld the neighbouring fastnesses, he ha 1 inflicted on them a series of defeats, attended with heavy losses to the Kaffirs, rind with comparatively little to Ills own troops. Tlse GOth Itifles had made their appearance in the field, where their weapons had told with powerful and seemingly decisive eflect. It was supposed that Macnmo would not he able much longer to hold his position in the Kaga mountains. On the other hand, it appears that the Kallirs are still 10 great force both in the Filii. Iiiver Bush and in the Aina- tola. They had just driven olt wme cattle from the vicinity of King William's Town, and they are actually according to one account, in the habit of amusing them- selves bv takiri'r post on the top of the liill near the town, where they hold \"along palaver,\" and, the wnter states, ,l abuse lis for not coming out to fight. This, of course is an evidence merely of the audacity and unabated confidence of the enemy. But it certainly aflo'dH no ground for supposing that in the opinion of the Kaffirs themselves, the fortune of war is turning against them. There is alsn, too much reason to fear that any opeuing prospects of success on our side will ouly lead to a much wider extension of the war, which may before long spread eastward beyond the Kei, antllwyond the Orange River.

The t reaxifnt's Message was delivered on luesday, tbe 2nd. The Presi- dent complains that certain Cubans residput in the United States have a second lillle made that country the scene tor the equipment of military expeditions against the posses- sions of her Spanish Majesty. Too severe a judgment, says the Message, cannot be passed upon those who by fraudulent representations led those thoughtless young mfnintoperiianddisgrace. Though the invaders had forfeited the protection of thpir country, no proper efforts had been, or will b?, spared to obtain the release of those now in conBoemeDt, for the sake of their families and friends. The President advocates adherence to our new neutrality and non-intervention policy. Our true mission, he says, is not to propagate our opinions to impose upon other couutries our form of government hy artifices or force, but to teach by example, and show by our success, moderation, and justice the blessings of sel -government and the advantage of free institutions.^ 1 he coriespon- dence with England and France respecting the invasion ot Cuba is referred to and submitted. It maintains the prin- ciple on the part of the United States, that in every regu- larly documented merchant vessel the crew who navigate it and those on board uf it will find there protection in the fla- that is over them. No American vessel can be al- lowed to be visited or searched for the purpose 01 ascer- taining the character of individuals on board, nor can there be allowed any watch by the vessels of any foreign nations over American vessels on the coast of the United States, or seas adjacent thereto. The reference to Kossuth is brief. In a communication to the Department of State, he his presented his acknowledgements for the interposition of the Government, and Congress is recommended to con- sider in what manner he and his companions, brought hither by its authority, shall be received uod treated.

The Aoia has brought home seventy-stx passengers <ud 930,000 in specie.

The arrival of the IlUfiflis aA New York furnMbed!&tet news from South America, which informs us that the rehettion inAntioqua,NewGrenada. had been entirety subdued by General Herrera. In Chili, -onthe (itlier hand, the revoht- tionists had tahen possession of severat towr's, and rmny of the troops bad declared in favour of a new man for the Presidency. The disorganised were sweeping aH b<'fofe tbem, and the country was in \u00c3\u00a1 most excited conditiun. The Alta Cort/brnto newspaper of the 9th September, furnishes the particulars of most disastrous ne\"s concerninK the vessels engaged in the North. Pacific Ftsuery. These accounts represent the destruction of vessets by the ice to be of the most alarming character. It is said that no less 60 sail have been crushed to pieces by the.ice, while endeavouring to force their way through Behring's Straits tnto the Arctic Sea. Six of them are said to be American, and two French. r The crews, with few exceptions, are reported to have got safe to land. A party of them were attacked by natives, in which 4 of the seamen and 14 of the savages were ki)!ed. The New England coast had been visited by a frightful hurricane, which had caused senous damage to the shipping on the coast. A 6re at St. Stephen's. Ne<)r Brunsvtick, had destroyed property to the amount of thirty thousand doUars. Later news had reached New York from Northern Mexico. The re'otution, it appears, is progressing at a rapid rate, and is supported by 10,000 men. 400 of whom, it is said, are from the neighbouring state of Texas. Metamoras was the point threatened at the last accounts. The insurrection, the New York. Herald sayt, was assuming a very important shape. The government of Mexico is incapable of resisting it, being without both money and credit. However, it was believed that Wild Cat, the celebrated Seminote chief, had been prevaited upon to march against the revotters. There was nothing, therefore, except the Indians to prevent the revotutionists accomplishing a)t they desire. It was expected that Metamoras would be attacked on the 17th utt. In the meantime General Abates was busity engaged strengthening the fortifications. The intelligence from the city of Mexico reports the state of matters there as very far from satitfac. tory. The government was in lamentable confusion, and it was nearly impassible to,get-together aquorum of the de- partments, and even wh*'n they do succeed they can agree on no one subject. The Yucatan, papers announce that the war with the Indians had been brought nearly to a close. The formation of a Canadian Ministry was all but com- plete, and is strictly a liberal Cabinet.

The despatches, in anticipation of the Overland Mail, have been received, and are from Calcutta and Singapore of the 1st June, and from Java and Hong- kong of the 25th and 23d of May.-The heat of the icason prevented all activity.

There was no progress mak- ing in the British negotiations with China. Obstacles had of late been laid in the way of the opium trade.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Disturbances continued at Bantam, on the Island of JaTa.-Some pirates had been seen in the waters of Klei, and a junk had been plundered.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe cholera was raging at Kambodia as much as formerly at Siam and Cochin China.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Oriental arrived from Cal- cutta at Suez on the 4th of July, having been delayed by the monsoon. She had CC passengers.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Bom- bay mail had not reached Aden on the 8th; it was expected to arrive on the 17th. The Queen of Spain was delivered on Friday last of a Prince, who died in a few minutes after his birth. The Queen's health was satisfactory. The Cambria steam-ship arrived at Liverpool on Wednesday with mails from New York to the 4th and Halifax to the 7th current. The California Compromise Bill has continued to occupy the attention of the American Senate. Mr. Soule, of Louisiana, had a motion in favour of limiting the southern boundary of California to the line of the Missouri Compromise, 369 30', and providing that the territory south of that line may hereafter be admitted as a separate state without restriction on the subject of slavery. This was rejected by 36 to 19. Mr. Web- ster made an able speech in favour of the immediate and unconditional admission. In the house, the bill for appropriating a portion of the public domain for military services has passed, with no provision for free jaiid to the actual settler. We regret to find that the Viceroy steamer, after an excellent voyage across the Atlantic from Galway, has been wrecked on the coast between New York and Hali- fax, but there was no loss of life. This must not dis- courage the Irish from their eaterprise. It is quite clear from this experiment that with a suitable vessel, the American continent would be brought nearer to us by three days, via Galway, than by any English port, and this must be again tested under more advantageous cir- cumstances. Professor Webster has confessed to the killing Dr. Parkman, but denies that the crime was premeditated, but the story is scarcely believed, and the Professor, there can be no doubt, will be hanged. We have elsewhere given the particulars of the confession. The American prisoners detained by the Spanish authorities of Cuba are confined on board the Spanish ship Coborana, while their trial is proceeding with the utmost deliberation. The issue of this affair is still uncertain. Dispatches to the United States squadron off Cuba were forwarded on Monday, from Washing- ton. by the steamer Vixen, which was fitted up for sea with great celerity, the workmen being employed night and day in getting her ready. It is supposed that a peremptory demand of the prisoners will be made by the President sustained by a stringent alternative in case of a refusal. It is stated, by private letlers from Havannah, that the ill-concealed antipathy of the Spanish population of Cuba against the United States, is expressed without disguise. Roncoli has lost ground in public opinion, on account of his apparent lenity An attempt has been made to depose him from office, in favour of Armero, the chief of the Marine force. The InJinn depredations by the last \"\"C\"t. were continued vith unabated violence in New Mexico. Ten American citizens were murdered by the Apaches in the month of May. The mail, with which they were entrusted, was found completely rifled of its valuable contents, and the bodies of the slain were stripped.- The excitement growing out of the attempt of Texas to assume authority over New Mexico is of a highly serious character. A convention of delegates assem- bled at Sante Ff, have formed and promulgated a con- stitution for the government of New Mexico. The session lasted nearly ten days; and the constitution was to go into operation on the 1st of July. The boundaries of the state were defined, and slavery pro- hibited. An election was to take place in a few days for the choice of members to the State Legislature. Two senators and representatives to Congress were also to be elected, and efforts would be made to pro- cure their acceptance at Washington. The city of Carmen, in Laguna, suffered from a de- structive fire on the 5th of June, which consumed forty-seven of the best houses in the city. The cholera is raging. The yellow fever has abated its ravages at Rio de Janeiro. It has appeared among the shipping in the River Plate, and is making its way south. The Vis- count de Macahe, counsellor of state and senator from the province of Bahia, died on the 29th of April of the prevalent fever. Advices from Buenos Ayres to the 19th of April state that General Rosas has declined treating with the French minister in regard to the difficulties now pending between the two nations. The ground of the refusal is said to he the large military and naval force at the command of the minister. Our dates from Honduras and Central America are to the 1st of June. The condition of trade was greatly depressed. A project was on foot for establishing a line of steamers on the coast of Costa Rica and Guate- mala. touching at Panama, and other important places. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe stockholders to the Nicaragua route to the Pa- cific are pushing on their enterprise with great activity The Howard line of steamers on both sides of the continent will run to this route as soon as the ar- rangements are complete. The Xrir Yuri Herald publishes a letter from a Venezuelan correspondent detailing the particulars of a reported conspiracy, on the part of General Monagas, to assassinate the celebrated General Paez by suffoca- tion. The bill to increase the number of representatives in the Canadian Parliament to 150, had been rejected, by a vote of 51 against 21, two thirds of the whole house, consisting of 84 members, being necessary to a decision. The address to the Queen in favour of placing the clergy reserves at the disposal of the legis- lature, and also expressing satisfaction with England. and a desire to continue the existing relations, was adopted by a large majority. Gonsalve Montesquieu, one of the French prisoners at St. Louis, under trial for murder, attempted to committ suicide on the evening of the 20th ult- by swallowing about two ounces of laudanum. It was soon discovered, and by the timely application of the stomach pump, the laudanum was extracted. The un- happy sufferer was in a state of great weakness, and the trial was in consequence postponed. A portion of the Table Rock at Niagara Falls, about furty feet long, gave way on the 29th ult. A carriage was passing at the time with six passengers, who saved their lives by leaping from the carriage, which was thrown over the precipice.

There are political divisions in Cuba, as in every other country, and taking advantage of this circumstance, an expedition was formed at New Orleans, under the com- mand of General LOPEZ, and landed on the 17th at Cardenas, a small town on the north- west side of the island, which only being de- fended by sixty men, was enabled to make but a small resistance against a body of men num- they f..no-lit until three of their number were killed, and the rest I driren into a church. A battle, which lasted an hour, took place at the Governor's house, and he was obliged to surrender with his staff, numbering one hundred persons, who were placed in the barracks. One hundred and fifty prisoners were released from the gaol, but they refused to join the invaders, the country people came in with hostile demonstrations against them, and all the foreigners, except Americans, offered their services to resist the aggression. The invaders remained in quiet possession of the city till evening, except LOPKZ and staff, and Captain LOGAN, of Ken- tucky, with twenty.ifve men, who went on board the Creole. At this juncture 2(10 Lancers and cavalry mounted and renewed the fight, which lasted nearly one hour, killing and wounding twelve of the invaders, including Captain LOGAN, who died on board the Creole.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY. The merchants interested in the trade with India, begin to be alarmed as to the fate of the railway between Alexandria and Cairo. It is known that the Porte oil- posed this measure at the instigation of France; but a fortnight ago it was announced, that no obstacle would be thrown in the way of its execution; although no ap- proval would be vouchsafed. Accounts received, how- ever, give another aspect to the affair. The Porte de- mands that the Pacha of Egypt shall, in all things, ,g)'I)t sh?ill, in all t l ii g s, submit to Turkish law and Turkish ordinances. To this the l'acha demurs; and the Porte having made this de- mand, now insists upon it as a sine qua tioii says that all agreements with respect to the railroad made before it is authorized by the Turkish Government, shall be null and void and that force shall be employed to prevent its execution, if necessary. The question is-what will Eng- land do in a matter that so intimately concerns her? Were Lord Palnierston to act as energetically as he did in the paltry case of Don Pacifico, the Porte would not dare to interfere with the making of the railway. Our dates from Bombay are to the 1st September. Gholab Singh had suppressed the outbreak in Cashmere. The Khan Heerat was dead, and Dost Mohammed had succeeded him, A great quantity of rain had fallen in Sinde and the i'unjaub, which had caused inundation and much loss of life and property. General Battine, Com- modore Hawkins, and M. de Bethune had died. The last would probably be succeeded by Sir E. Perry.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Frauds to the extent of \u00c2\u00a3 70,000 had been discovered in the opium department at Bombay. An expedition was being fitted out there against the Arabs round about Aden. The steamer America arrived at Liverpool from Boston on Sunday morning. The Europe reached Boston on the 17th. Intense excitement prevailed at Baltimore and and throughout Pennsylvania, in consequence of the negro outrage at Christiana (reported by last steamer), by which Mr. Edward Gorsuch, the owner of the two fugitives whom lie attempted to recover, was killed, and Ins son mortally wounded the son was not dead at last accounts, but lie was not expected to survive many hours. Several arrests of both whites and natives supposed to be concerned in the outrage had been made, and an armed force had been sent to Christiana to prevent any further outbreak, The Government has offered a reward of 4,000 dollars for the arrest and conviction of the offen- ders. Mr. James Fenimore Cooper, the distinguished American novelist, expired at his residence, Cooper's. town,on Sunday, the lith inst., at the age of 62 years. Great preparations are making at Boston for the railroad jubilee, at which the President and most of the hi\"h officials are expecte d to be present. Catherine Haves been received v?-itli ver y r had been received with very great enthusiasm. There had been several serious fires at New York. The heat had been intense at New York. Several deaths from couj) tte soleil are reported. The Canadian accounts uo- tice the fact of strenuous exertions being made to induce the free black population of Canada to emigrate to of a- maiea, where its services would be so very valuable. The weather in Upper Canada, after being very hot, had be- come chilly and wet. Port-au-Platt, St. Domingo, was on the 17th ult., visited by a very severe hurricane, which tore up large trees from the roots, and destroyed from fifteen to twenty houses. The shipping in the har- bour also suffered severely. The English Brazil packet was driven on shore and totally lost; a seaman belonging to her was also drowned.

{"ocr": "Europe Reviewed a Series of Dreams, BY THE HEIUIIT IN AUSTRALIA. [To avoid repetition the reader will suppose the shade of Napoleon to be still speaking.] The question of German unity still drags its slow length aloug. The war languishes in Sleshwick; while the King of Denmark, as if to hasten the contempt into which the kings of Europe are fast sinking, has (Harried a woman of loose reputation. What must his people and his army think of him ? Is it likely they will sacrifice their blood and treasure for such a Prince? Certainly not But it further appears that he is to abdicate so soon as the question of succession is set- tled. Admitting this to he true, for argument sake,- How vastly absurd the idea of two armies fighting for a shadow for they cannot even know who their King may be. It suits the policy of Russia tp foment the discord for the purpose of weakening Denmark, with the ulti- mate view of gaining the keys of the Baltic.\" Such an event would not only be total ruin to buried Den- mark,\" but a European misfortune; and the western maritime powers would not tamely look 011 while such a grave event was taking place. To go back to the German question,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdTie great obstacle in the way of unity is its division ino pretty nearly equal moieties\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe one professing the Catholic, the other the Protestant religion. This tifficulty, which it is the object of the despotic powers t> foster, cannot continue much longer. Austria, tie great Catholic power of Germany, is fast sinking int> a state of financial ruin. This begins to be generally foreseen 011 the English stock exchange, and accounts for the exceeding dulness exhibited for a length of titre by the members of that spirited fraternity, in the way of spe- culation.

A bad harvest wouli acce- lerate the event more than any thing else that could happen, for the kings are aware, that to go to far, is to seal their own doom. Here, Alonzo you hare the key to the whole question and it behoves all Ei^lish- rnen engaged in commerce or in speculations ef any kind, to watch and ascertain the result of the general harvest throughout Europe, for upon that will the crisis hinge. Death lias been busy in high places, and the Pre- sident of the Utrted States has departed from your world. This will make very little apparent charge in that mighty republic; but the indirect result is inpor- tant. President Polk, the late head of the repiblk, had departed before him. It is strange that the prin- cipal man in power during the Californian conquest, should so soon have disappeared from the stige of existence.

{"ocr": "A mad attempt has been made by General LOPEZ, one of those military adventurers who at present infest the world, to invade Cuba and overthrow the Spanish government. LorEZ sailed from New Orleans, taking with him about five hundred men, most of them citizens of the United States, desperate wretches who had survived the Mexican war, in which war they had their first taste of plunder. They landed at Cardenas, a small town and fort in Cuba, where, after some fighting', they took the governor and two or three of his officers prisoners, and plundered the public chest of its contents. Apprehensive of danger, LOPEZ, as soon as he got the money, fled to the Savannah, in the steamer which had brought him and his co-robbers from New Or- leans. He was pursued by a Spanish armed steamer, but he unfortunately made his escape Upwards of a hundred of his band were captured by the Spaniards, and every tenth man instantly shot, the remainder being consigned to dungeons. So ends this vagabond exploit for the present. It was said, at first, that several thousand men had been engaged in the invasion. The latest arrivals do not confirm this. But it does appear strange that the authorities of the United States either could not, or would not, prevent the embarkation of so many men. That the expe- dition was planned in America, and openly avowed for months previously, was well known to the government of Washington. It was universally known in New Orleans that LOPEZ and his gang of mercenary Yankees meditated a robbery. It is true they had not committed the felony. They had procured the instruments, however, and other means for the accomplishment of their purpose. This, we say, the American government was apprised of, but nothing was done to stop the expedition. But now that the attempt has been made, and the act of piracy perpetrated, it remains to be seen what Mr. President TAYLOR will direct to be done. LorEZ and his co-operators are guilty of a crime which is punishable by death according to the laws of all nations. Spain has a right to demand this punishment by the American Government, or the arrest and surrender of the pirates. If a British ship of war had been at the Havana her commander would have been obliged to assist in capturing the pirates. The obligation is equally binding upon France and all other friendly allies. We are far from believing that the President of the United States is disposed to protect, far less encourage, a public crime of this nature. On the contrary, he issued a proclamation against a former attempt from another part of the republican territories. Still we very well know that there is a considerable party in the United States who are favourable to the conquest and annexation of Cuba. It would be a most valuable and important possession in the hands of the Americans. Its fertile soil, its sugar and other productions, and its trade, are what Jonathan is anxious to enjoy and there cannot be a doubt that, if LOPEZ had succeeded, the island would soon have been transferred to the United States. Cuba, from its position, commands the whole of the Gulf of Mexico, and Great Britain is deeply concerned as to who shall have possession of it. The seizure of the Texas, the subsequent, if not consequent, invasion of Mexico, and the annexation of California, all evince the encroach- ing and aggressive spirit of the American people. In their land of liberty\" slavery flourishes like a green bay tree. Cuba would afford to them a rich field for the extension of this execrable labour. The cultivation of sugar would be more profitable than Indian corn, or even cotton, and it would be another blow to the colonial empire of England. But when reasoning upon schemes of policy, we should never forget justice. Is it endurable that a fugitive adventurer and a band of des- perate miscreants should be allowed to disturb the peace of a colony with which they have nothing to do, and upon which they have no claim whatever\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdto destroy innnocent men, and plunder property ? Upon deeds of this kind England must look with abhorrence. What injury has Spain done to LOPEZ and his black. guards ? What this man has done in Cuba he would have the same warrant for doing in Jamaica, or any other of her Majesty's more defenceless colonies in the West Indies. It is the duty of all states to assist each other in suppressing and punishing piracy, and no nation is more concerned in the observance of the duty than England herself.", "word": "781", "description": "\u2026 the Americans.

We have been favoured with a cop), of the Adelaide Observer\" of the -5th of July, and another of tht fcth A fresh discovery of gold has taken place at Stony Creek O Connell s plains, 30 miles south of Bathurst. The other placers are north and west of Bathurst. There is no doubt of the whole district being an extensive gold field. In consequence of the gold mania, flour has risen to double its price in this country, but otherwise the markets were not much affected. At Sydney the excite- ment had considerably abated. On the subject of colonial labour, a notice appears from the Colonial Labour Office, in the\" Government Gazette,\" dated Adelaide, July 9th, from which we take the following extract, which may prove of service to those whose attention has been directed to Australian emigra- tion, but whose habits aud pursuits render them unquali- fied for taking such a step:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" The persons most out of employ, are those who ought never to hare come. Farm- ing and mining are the staple employments, and these are not overdone; but of what use are portrait-painters, druggists' assistants, lawyers' clerks, book-keepers, sales- men, storekeepers, and persons who have no trade in their hands, in a colony like this, consisting of 70,000 persons in all grades of society? Care must be taken by philan- thropic individuals only to send such as can labour hard for their living-busli work is no child's play, and masters who have to work hard for their own living, have a strong desire that their workmen should be able to endure hard work also. Women, too, who know nothing of house- work, and the proper duties of a family, are very unfit to be sent here; because, a man having his own land, and getting a living thereby, wants a wife who can manage in-doors, while he is doing the business of the farm. Needle-woir.en, ladies' maids, dressmakers, upper nurses, genteel housekeepers, and all highly-educated poor wo- men, have very little chance here to get on the fact is, all have to work, and work hard, because seventeen out of every twenty farmers work upon their own land, and do the work mainly themselves-and what can these do with fine ladies for wives and helpers.\" The Canada steamer arrived at Liverpool on Sunday. The Atlantic reached New York on the loth instant, having hpen detained 49 hours in consequence of an acci- dent to her machinery. TheU.S.M. steam-ship Washin\u00c2\u00ab- ton, Capt.

The St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad was to be opened on the 15th. Jenny Lind was to give a concert at Toronto, on the 17th. Captain Brockbank, of the gun-brig Chatsworth, was arrested, on the 13th, at Baltimore, on an United States warrant, and committed on default of bail.

The President had issued orders to the military commandants on the frontier to prevent an invasion of Mexico by American citizens. We learn from Toronto that the new Canadian Minis- try, as far as announced, is composed as follows :111'. Hincks, Inspector General; Dr. Ralph, President of the Council; Malcolm Cameron, Postmaster-General; Wil- liam Morris, Commissioner of Crown Lands; W. B. Richards, Attorney-General for the Western Province; Mr, Drummond, Attorney-General for the East; Mr. Morin, Provincial Secretary. Three other members of the Cabinet have yet to be appointed. Altogether, it will be the most Liberal Government Canada has had. Advices from Vera Cruz, to the 4th instant. had been received at New Orleans. Accounts from the city of Mexico to the 7th instant represent the Government to be in great confusion, and almost without resources, the Treasury being at the lowest ebb. Many ineffectual efforts had been made to form a new Cabinet. The ac- counts of the revolution in the northern provinces had not reached the capital. The liberating army were still on a successful move, and had taken the town of Reynosa, with but little resistance. One field-piece and a quantity of other arms fell into their hands. At the last accounts, General Canales, Governor ofTamaupas, was approaching Matamoras, and General Avalajos was on his way to meet him, whether as a friend or foe is uncertain. It is supposed that Canales will assume the chief command of the Revolutionists, an act that will displease the Ameri- can partizans. The new French Ministry is formed. It is Progres- sionist, and with a strong Bonapartist tendency. M. Billaut is Minister of the Interior and chief of the Ca- binet. We may expect direct hostility from the majority of the National Assembly. The Government has received positive intelligence of the existence of Secret Societies in seven Departments, all armed, and acting under the control of the Socialist refugees in London. It is also in possession of positive information that Kossuth has entertained propositions for joining the European Socialist Democratic Committee.

In consequence of this arrangement the SULTAN has consented that those Polish subjects of Russia who have been concerned in the late Hungarian movement shall be ob- liged to leave the Turkish dominions, and a similar arrangement with the Austrian Cabinet appears to be anticipated. Two lists of the proscribed have already been drawn out, one at Vienna, the other at St. Petersburgh.

PARLIAMENT was Prorogued yesterday (Thursday), upon which occasion Her Majesty delivered the fol- lowing gracious Speech:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd My LORDS AND GENTLEMEN, I have the satisfaction of being able to release you from the duties of a laborious Session. The assiduity and caie with which you have applied yourselves to the business which required your attention, merit ray cordial appro- bation. The Act for the better government of my Australian Colonies will, I trust, improve the condition of those rising communities. It will always be gratifying to me to be able to extend the advantages of representative in- stitutions, which form the glory and happiness of my people, to colonies inhabited by men who are capable of exercising, with benefit to themselves, the privileges of freedom. It has afforded me great satisfaction to give my assent to the Act which you have passed for the improvemei-t of the Merchant Naval service of this country. It is, I trust, calculated to promote the welfare of every class connected with this essential branch of the National in- terest. The Act for the gradua) discontinuance of iuterments within the limits of the Metropolis, is in conformity with those enlightened views which have for their object the improvement of the public health. I shull watch with interest the progress of measures relating to this im portant subject. I have given my cordial assent to the Act for the ex- tension of the elective franchise in Ireland. I look to the most beneficial consequences from a measure which has been framed with a view to give to my people in Ireland a fair participation in the benefits of our repre- sentative system. I have observed, with the greatest interest and satisfaction, the measures which have been adopted with a view to the improvement of the adminis- tration of justice in various departments, and I confi- dently anticipate they will be productive of much public convenience and advantage. GENTLEMEN OF THE HoesE OF COMMONS, The improvement of the Revenue, and the large reduc- tions which have been made in various branches of ex- penditure, have tended to give to our financial condition stabitityand security. I am happy to find that you have been enabled to relieve my subjects from some of the burthens of taxation, without impairing the sufficiency of our resources to meet the charges imposed upon theul.

{"ocr": "ENGLAND AND AMERICA. Mr. Jefferson, the most exclusively American, and am- bitious of the several Presidents of the United States, first broached the doctrine that the interest-) of America impe- ratively compelled her to declare that no European State should henceforth acquire additional power or teiritory in America. England for many years after the declaration of independence by the United States was in possession of territories on the North American continent more extpn-ive than those of any other nation, whether European or American. France soon after that event sold her Ameri- can dominions to the United States; Spain lest her great province of Mexico; and the whole continent was evidently destined to be the property of the two sections of the Aiiijlo- Sixon race-the one under the flag of Eneland, the o her under that of the United States. The maxim of American podcy thus first enunciated by Jeffjrson was, in fact, directed airainst England, and we are now led to inquire why the one section of Englishmen, who constitute the Republic of the United States, may acquire territory and influence upon the continents of North and South America whiie those who still remain English, and constitute the English nation, are to be excluded from any participation in these advantages. W ithiti the last century the United States has more than quadruple-) the extent of its territories\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdpartly by ptirclusp, partly by iuttigue, partly hy conquest. The nation which in 1783 was confined on the north hy British America, on the east hy the Atlantic, on the west by toe Mississippi, and on the south by F.orida, has now so extended its southern boundary as to have reached the Gulf of Mexico, aid so stretched its western limit as to have the Pacific Ocean washing tire whole length ot its boundary. The peop:e who when they declared themselves independent did not exceed 3,000,000 souls, now amount to above 25,000,000 and this powerful people coolly inform the nations of Europe that ils safety is incompatible with any acquisition of terri'ory by any European state on the American coniioent. Indeed we have strong reason to believe that the inquiry lately- made by the Cabinet of Washington respecting the treaty supposed to have been concluded between England a')d the States of Yucatan and Costa Rica was suggested by the leelinti which first gave birth to this exclusive maxim, and was intended to convey to England a hint that the United States meant to resent any such interference in American affairs a-; the onp supposed. That peace should he maintained between England and the United States must be tile wish of every ratiOlld man on both sides ot the Atlautie. but peace can only be main- tained by just conduct-on the \"rt of both nat ons, aud any attempt on the part of the United States to possess her- self of further tel ritory would render it a matt r of absolute necessity on the part of England to interfere and prevent such aggression. Mexico at present lies helpless, and if England should s'aild idly by, and not insist on the main- tenance of the Mexican Republic in its existing integrity one compaigu would suffice to add the chief State ofCeutral' America to the already formidable confederition of the United States. England has herself no desire to acquire territory in Central America; but if there he anv symptom of an intention to encroich upon Mexico exhibited by the Cabinet of Washington, we should do wisely to extend our protection to the independent republics which at present hold as rig'itful possessors the whole of Central America. And the United States couid hare no rational ground of complaint if England were to enter into an ailianc- of friendship and protection, not only with Y ucatau aud Costa Rica, but with every one of the remaining republics, Mexico inc uded. This is a subject which for many reasons must continue to occupy the serious attention ol English statesmen. It is evident that shortly a communication will be completed between the two oceans, and we have se n that a very wholesome jealousy on the part of Engiand has been exhibited with respect to this. which is about to be the great high-way of nations. So fir as a nation can be bound by treaties, we are aware that the United States are at this moment by the late treaty under a strict obi gation to permit to all nations full permission to use without hindrance the intended canal and nil way. But this sutject is to us of so vast an importance as respects our posses-ions in Asia and Australasia that we are bound to take everv possible precaution against interruption at the Isthmus of Panama. The United States has admitted the justice of this as-ertioo by the late treaty, in negotiating which Sir Heorylblwer has shown great judgment and prudence. But a wise policy suggests the necessity of some further precaution by means of an immediate arrangement with the States of Central America with reference to this great channel of communication, through which must pass an immense portion of the commerce of the world. If any nation has a right to be jealous with respect to this subject, it is England; the United St-ites is without any pretext for fear upon the occasiou, and must not be allowed to lay down and maintain maxitus of international policy the only object of which must be to prepare for herself universal dominion upon the continent of America Times. THE NAVIGATION LAWS. The result of the first haK-year's experience of the work- ing of the Navigation Laws Repeal Act is certainly not one which is likely to be very gratifying to the British ship- owners. The following is the tabular statement: Tonnage entered inwards.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdSix months ending July 5. ) 184S. 1849. 1850. British vessels 1,537,803 1,706,174 1,601,167 United States' vessels 2ti5,030 333,464 253 341 Other countries 353,007 441,159 5G7,758 2,160,840 2,540,797 2,422,266 The clearances outwards were:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd 1848. 1849. 1850. British vessels 1,571,158 1,838,388 1,977,454 United States'vessels 222,840 310,075 202,932 Other couu tries 398,9\u00c2\u00ab9- 453,348 575^620 2,192,967 2,601,811 2,816,006 There has thus been a falling-offin the tonnage inwards of British vessels of 165,007 tons, or nearly 10 per cent., this half-year, as compared with the first six months of 1849; and of 80,123 tons, or 24 per cent., of American shipping. We have, however, an increa\u00c2\u00abe in the shipping of other (European) countries of 120,559 tons, or nearly 30 per cent and of 206,7 51 tons, or nearly 60 per cent. over that of the first six months of 1848. In the clearances out- wards we have au increase in British shipping of 139,066 tons or about 71 per cent., a decrease in American of 27,143 tons, or 15 per cent., and an increase in ether ship- ping of 122,272 tons, or 27 per cent, as compared with 1849, and 176,051, or nearly 45 per cent. as compared with 1848. We can readily account for the falling-off in American tonnage by the partial ;ailure of the cotton crop and the diminution of our imports of bread-stiifEs from that country. A large number of United States' vessels have also been taken up by the trade to the Pacific, California. &c. A further portion has no doubt gone out to seek freight for this country in our colonial and other distaut ports. But with respect to the shipping of Europe, in whieh we find so Mazing an increase, the conclusion is irresistible that it is rapidiy superseding our own marine. The grain and tim- ber of Europe are cotniog almost together in foreign bot- toms. It was doing so previously to the repeal of the Navi- gation Laws; and it has doubled its increase since. With respect to British shipping, the decline would be still greater if we were to exclude from the returns the frequent passages inwards and Outwards of our sea-going steamers. As those returns are at present made out, a Boulogne or lizisre packet of 200 tons register, goin^ out and returning weekly, counts for 5,000 tons in the half-year. A single Halifax steamer, making ten trips a year, counts from 5,000 to 6,000 tons 111 tllo lialf-yenr, inwards and outwards. Now. does the coasting trade display any great indication of progress ? We find that the tonnage entered inwards was 6,309,161 in the half-year en iing the 5th of July. 1848; 5,801.571 in t\"e sauie period of 1849, and 6,106,635 in that of 1850. The clearances out wards were 6.6SG.274 in the first half of 1843 6.221,486 in that of 1849; and 0,032,458 in that of 185:), There is a falling-off here in the I st six months asco npared with 1848 in the tonnage both in wards and out waul. although we have a slight increase over that of 1849. To what circumstances we are to attribute the apparent rally made by the trade this year we know not but the fact of its being still below that of 1848, is not at all consolatory. Mere statistical returns, however, convey but a slight idea of the real effect of the repeal of the Navigation Laws upon our shipping interest, or of any legislation atlecting trade and commerce. The true test is the profit or loss at which it is carried on. If we had a statement of the aggregate amount lost to our ship-owners, both in the foreign \"and coasting trade, by tiM fall in freights and the depreciation in the value ot-wess\u00c2\u00abl3i 7\u00c2\u00bbt would probably startle our free- trade phiio-ophers. The latter is estimated on good autho- rity at not less than 15 percent, upon every ship brought into the market for sale. A reduction of a pound per ton has been compelled to be submitted to by most of our ship- builders. The reduction in freights is still more ruinous- in fact it may be Fafe,y said that nine-tenths of the foreign going shipping of the country have been worklug during the past six months ht a loss to the owner. Shippin\" engaged in the coasting trade has been doing even worse5 and has become, as property, almost valueless. So much for free- trade.-Liverl oot Standard. 4 IRELAND. DUBLIN. MONDAY MORNING. THE HARVEST. There is another series of favourable reports this morning and if the conclusion arrived at by the majority of the pro- vincial papers he not too hastily drawn, it may be inferred that the potato is almost beyond the reach of further danger. All the last accounts concur in representing the late wet weather as being conducive to the safety of the crop for in those instances where the leaves and stalks had been dis- coloured by the symptoms of the blight, they have already assumed their orig na) green and healthy colour. Harvest operations are proceeding vigorous'y in the vicinity of Cork, nearly all the wheat crop being ready for the sickle and the weather most propitious. From Galway, S.igo, aud North Tipper ry\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdlistricts wherea fortnight since thegreat est alarm prevailed, owing to the rapid spread of the potato dlsea.e-be advices are aow of a directly contrary teudency, and the all-but unanimous impression appeals to be that the Ions wili be so trifling as to reckon nothing compared to the vast quantity thai wi.l be saved for consumption. Bere, barley, oats, and green crops are promising aud abundant; and although there dre still gloomy reports of the failure of wheat, it is believed that in some cases, as in Tipperary, the extent ot the damage sustained by this crop has been exag- gerated. \u00c2\u00b0 EMIGRATION FROM THE SOUTn.

There was, i)evertlicle??, not the least a;li-\"a\"- ance of a disturbance, till \"omc persons approached i i,? tablet on which were inscribed the names of thetailei;, for the purpose of decorating it with flowers. This act being opposed by some of the authorities, loud cries of indignation escaped from the assembly, on which the gendarmerie rushed out and drove all before them, men, women and children, to the doors of the sacred edifice, where they used every persuasion, but without effect, then fired, but into the air, and used their canes in expelling the congregation. The 1'iedumiU \u00c2\u00ab*\u00c2\u00bb Go;, II\" of the 3rd inst., announces that Queen Maria Adelaide was safely delivered of a prince during the preceuing night. The royal infant was christened on the 3rd in the Chateau of Monca- lieri, and received the following names and title, Cliai-le, Albert Ferdinand Marie Eugene, ] luke de Challais. The Queen Dowager and Prince Eugene of Savoy Carignan held him at the baptismal font, in the name of the Duke and Duchess of Genoa. Letters of the tilt. from Bucharest announce the complete evacuation of the Danubian provinces by the Russian troops. A firman of the sultan had been ad- dressed to the hospodars, reminding them of the re- doubled vigilance in the interest of order imposed by the withdrawal of the troops. After fourteen (lavs, bombardment Omer Pasha bad taken Bihacz, in Bosnia, by storm. Letters from liadajoz report that the officers of the Portuguese troops stationed at Elvas, in Campo Mat (-,r. had intimated that though willing to remain faithful to the queen and the charter, and wishful not to disobey Saldanha, yet they could not consent to serve under Baron Das Antas, sent by Saldanha to command them, as the baron was a former member of the junta of Oporto. These letters also intimate that the movement at Elvas would probably be followed at Oporto, where the troops were placed under Baron de Bimtin, who is little liked by the army. Marshal Narvaez has left Paris for London. It is said a reconciliation between him and Lord Palmerstor. is likely to take place during his visit. A telegraphic despatch from Vienna, published in the Amjshurti Gazelle, announces the advance of th! Austrian troops to Spoleto, in the Papal States. The population of Old ('alabar. watching for a fa- vourable opportunity, have at length broken out agair.it the constituted authorities, and taken possession of everything on shore. II.M. ship Gladiator (H), and Arahia (141, being in (,larencc, went over imml diatd, and a despatch was sent to Nir. liicoft to briri; him down from the Dohmy country. The revolt, it j, feared, will entail serious damage to the British vessels trad- ing there, the slaves having possession of every thing. The Brazilian government are pursuing their mea- sures for the suppression of the slave trade with in- creased energy. A fine has been itr.poct d on several of the most prominent dealers, and one of them has been forced to leave the country. The s lave trade is declared to be piracy, and the punishment ot death will be inflicted 01] every captain of a ve\u00c2\u00bb\u00c2\u00abel c<>(.(11 of the crime. Under this policy, pursued with Vigour by the government, there was little doubt that the in- famous trade would he speedily an\u00c3\u00b9 effectually abo- lished. The yellow fever still prevailed among the shipping in the harbour, and to some extent in the city. No decisive steps had been taken in regard to tJJf; war with the Arg -ntine Republic. Advices from Mexico, state that General Carasco, who wats employed to suppress Indian outrages in Sonoro1, had burnt down several villages belonging to peaceful Indians, and shot two friendly chiefs. Thi6 conduct had excited just indignation and abhorrence, not only on aceollnt of the alleged atrocity, but because it was likely to kindle an Indian war in every remote province. Indian murders in Durango have been tear- fully frequent: and it is said that several streets in the citv of Mexico have been abandoned by their inhabit- ants, owing to the many robberies that were committed. Battles between the police and banditti had occurred in the open StEds. A new police had been organised, laws have been pased against gambling\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat root of all evil in Mexico,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand a company was proceeding to erect a line of magnetic wires between Vera Cruz and the capital. The chamber of deputies have granted a l extension of fort Y days for the conversion of the illleriol debt. The senate made it pi\u00c2\u00a1!]\u00c2\u00a1ly, and sent it back to the deputies for approval. Since that time, nothing has been done with it. There are no funds to meet Ih consolidation. It is supposed that the J-.ngltsh creditors will not ohl\"in \u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00a1 penny oflheir debt. The advices from the Cape of Good Hope are InU,:1 more favourable, and report a defeat of the Kafirs Lv the British troops. There is, however, obviously a great deal yet t\" be dene, and the war seems likely to he protracted. The details are given elsewhere. Ti\u00c2\u00a1e stra:J1l'r Cambria, from Boston and Halifax, arrived at Liverpool on Suudav night. The President, after his tour ill the state of New York, had returned to Washington.

A battle between a company of Texan militia, and a part* of Indians, occurred on the 'Jlth ult., near the htad waters of the 1.eona. and a similar altair had occurred between Red River and the Bragos.

The President ot the Chinese cabinet died very soon after rhe Emperor's deceage. The commercial treaty between America and China had not been concluded.

{"ocr": "I FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. I I FRANCE. I The great topic is the President's dotation,\" as it is the fashion to call an addition of three millions of francs to his salary, which he demands on the ground of extra expenses. One of the reasons alleged is that an average of 150 petitions for relief is sent to him daily. There is little of doubt of the temper of the Chamber to reject the application, if they were able to decide freely on the matter but they are afraid that an appeal to the coun- try will raise the sum by voluntary subscription, and add a new proof of the general popularity of the Pre- sident of the Republic. Nothing has been done during the week but the coalition, supposed to be destroyed, is actively and earnestly on the watch for opportunities. The first step with regard to the Dotation Bill is not a very favourable one. The commission chosen to exa- mine and report upon it is, after the French fashion, selected from men of opinions already known, and therefore singularly well qualified to inquire into a mat- ter in which they are already compromised. Two only out of fifteen are favourable to the dotation. The Moderate organs in the press tell the Assembly that they cannot do better than grant the dotation with as little fuss as possible. I ITAIIY. J I The Roman correspondent of the Times has revived the rumour of the intended abdication of the Pope, and declares that at this naooieot it is the subject of the secret council of the Cardinal though, no doubt, as on former occasions, it will bd tu ken and treated as a pure invention on his part. The correspondent of the Globe states that\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLord Feilding is making his round of devo- tional pilgrimages at Rome. When he visited the Church of St. Peter and Vide ula, at his request the chains of the Apostle were placed upon his neck, and afterwards on that of Lady Feilding, and of the servant man. He has ordered a silver cradle to he made for the infant statue called the Santo Bambino, in the Church of Ara Coeli, in the hope that thereby an heir may be granted to perpetuate the honours of his noble house. The most important portion of the foreign intelligence is that which relates to Italy. It is reported that Maz- zini and his associates have returned to Geneva with the view of organising another attack on Italy, and, if pos- sible, rekindling the flame of revolution. They are said to be well supplied with money and other means of carrying out their design. Garibaldi is also expected from New York with two ship loads of volunteers, most of whom have served in Mexico The point of rendezvous spoken of, is somewhere in the Neapolitan dominions, but the Austrians, in order to defeat the plan, intend, it is said, to enter and occupy the Swiss territory early in spring A few days ago it was reported in Paris that the Pope had *Rain taken flight to Gaeta, but the report has not been confirmed. The Stadtholders of SCHLKSWIG-HOLSTETN have re- signed to a Provisional Government, which will carry out the will of Austria and Russia. A deep and widely-spreading conspiracy is said to have been discovered in Vienna, proving the never end- ing labours and anxieties of beaurocratic Governments.

Seve- ral other Spanish officers and a large number of men were also slain, Tiie furce of Geueral Lopez it is reported amounted to from fifteen hundred to two thousand men.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY. There can be no doubt that the Porte and Abbas Pa- sha would come to an amicable arrangement respecting the new Egyptian Railway. Information arrived at Gibraltar on the 18th of Oct. that a large number of piratical Moors, on the Rif Coast of Morocco, had taken a brig, the crew of which escaped in their boats. If. M. S. Indus went over in search of the vessel, and on her arrival on the coast the Moors attacked her. Lieutenant Pownall and the master's- assistant were wounded, also eight of the crew, one of whom has since died. Information has since arrived that the Moors have six English seamen from another vessel, for whom they demand 600 dollars ransom. The\" Daily News correspondent says that the Janus steamer suc- ceeded in destroying the pirate boats; but other advices say she was beaten off. The steam-ship Asia, Captain Judkins, reached the Mersey on Saturday evening last. She left New York on the 22nd ultimo, and brought sixty-six passengers and 330,000 dollars in specie on freight. The money market was easier, and the receipts of gold from California hav- ing been large, the banks were extending their discounts. The cotton market had rallied a little, and quotations were one-eighth higher than by previous ad vices. The weather continued favourable for the growing crop. We have advices from San Francisco to September 15, by the steamer Illinois, which had on board nearly 2,000,000 dollars in gold dust. Lynch law seem to have given place to the code of honour, for nobody has been hung by the vigilance committee, while some half-dozen duels have taken place. Political disputes were at the bottom of these affitirs. The election returns for governor are still uncertain, though the probability is in favour of the Whig candidate. The Legislature will have a majority of the opposition, insuring the election of the opposition candidate to the United States Senate, in place of Colonel Fremont. The city of Marysville has been visited with another serious fire, and Spanishtown, on the Calaveras River, has suffered from an extensive conflagration, which consumed 150 dwellings, the whole loss amounting to 250,000 dollars. The accounts from the mining districts, continue to be of the most encour- aging character. The quantity of gold which will be extracted this year is estimated at 70,000,000 of dollars. Measures are on foot for the construction of a railroad between San Francisco and San Jose, with a capital of 1,500,000 dollars, of which the amount of 150,000 dollars has been subscribed. The people of the southern counties have got up a movement for the division of the state and the establishment of their part as a territory without restriction as to slavery. The reason they give is the great cost of the state government. The news of the gold discovery in -New South Wales had induced many Sydney people to leave San Francisco. Two vessels with one hundred and thirty passengers had sailed for Sydney, and nine other vessels, with accommodations for forty passengers each, were preparing to follow.

There have been some serious floods at New Or- leans, Point Coupee, Ohio, and Indiana. These floods are not the regular spring overflows, which are looked for with dread by persoll. living on the western rivers, and it is probable that the flood ot April will be very serious.

The passengers had beyond the above amount 350,00t) dollars. The emigration from the Atlantic ports was even greater than last year. The disastrous overflow of the Sacramento was rapidly subsiding. The population wintering at the mines is estimated at upwards of 75,000. At Sonorian Camps much gold had been found, one entire piece weighing upwards ot 2:ilbs. It was reported that a piece of nearly 851bs. had been picked up, Vessels continue to arrive at the rate of six to twelve each day. Prices for everything has ruled rather high in the fall.

{"ocr": "LET what will he the immediate event, the future for Cuba looms darkly. The evil-spirit in her varied and mixed races cannot but be excited by such scenes as the next month will witness on her shores. f The fatal example set by England in her interferance in the Civil War in Spain between the Queen and ( Don Carlos, is being followed by our Transatlantic relations. On the plea that Civil War has broken out in Cuba between the Royalists and the Independents, and on the ground that in such a case it is compe- tent for the citizens of any nation to side with either one or other of the combatants,\" the Cuban Legion has sailed upon its piratical expedition. The world has had too recent experience of the American mode of annexation and conquest, to feel surprised at an expedition of four thousands republican sympathisers in the case of Cuba. It is the old American game ever again, commencing in a modest way, until, by degrees, the stolen state is formally annexed to the immaculate Union. Though for months it was well known thoughout not only the Southern States, but the whole of the Union, and more than once ru- moured in the public prints of other climes, that the would-be Californian Emigrants were but a cloak for Cuban sympathisers though the means by which money was raised was not concealed, and assignats on the land in Cuba\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdyet to be stolen\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwere freely sold to raise supplies though it was known that the command of the piratical army had been offered to a general of the States army, and that constant drilling was going on, the official ear in Washington was con- veniently deaf. Not a word did it hear officially of the true nature of Californian emigrants, until the first batch had sailed,and were so far away that, with per- fect safety to them and his fleet, the President could order his ships of war to intercept these American pirates. In the case of Cuba, this official deafness is nnjustiiiable. Years since, in the days of President Jackson, the States, fearful lest Spain, through her weakness, should suffer Cuba to fall into the hands of any other power, voluntarily guaranteed the posses- sion of that isle to the Spanish Crown, on the condi- tion of its never making a voluntary cession of it to another nation. From the ports, then, of not only a friendly power, but of a protecting power, this expe- dition has been allowed to sail. Of the fate of this expedition it is premature to speak all that we know for certain is, as was to be expected, it escaped the States cruisers, landed, and seized the fort of Cardennas, composed of men who have seen severe and wreckless service in Mexico, fully armed, brave to desperation, and marksmen such as few nations can produce, they will fight a good fight against the best troops and the most overwhelming numbers.

The National hav- ing as eried in its number of the 15th inst. that a ciptain of the National Guard at Montbard had taken the President by the hand and forced him to cry Vive la ReptibUqne lJ\u00c3\u00a9- mocratique, the authorities of the town have contradicted the assertion in the most formal manner, declaring it to be totally unfounded. 'The numerous persons,' they Fay, 'who surrounded the carriage of the President, expressed to him their profound respect and devotedness, and the Captain of the Natioual Guard alluded to loudly protested. by the cry of Vive Napoleon, against another cry feebly ut- tered by a group of individeals stationed at a certain dis- tance on the square.' There is more than usual activity at present observable at the Government ironfoundry at Nantes. The machinery for three war steamers now build- ing at Cherburg is nearly complete, viz.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe Morceau corvette, of 120-horse power; the Phlegethon, of 400-horse power; and the Austerlitz. ship of the line, of 100 guns, to be fitted with a *crew o' 500-horse power. SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEiN. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdREifDsBtruo, AUG. 1..1.- We are still expecting au engagement, which is looked for- ward to both by the army and the inhabitants with equal impatience. In the intervat the monotony of a fortress and the total absence of events furnish no materials that cin be made generally interesting. Volunteers continue to arrive, but they are to the rank and file of the army; the list of offic 'rs is not yet filled up. It is reported here that ra^es of choleia have occurred among the soldiers of the Danish garrison in Schleswig. HAMBURGH. AUG. 15, 3 P.M.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Hanoverian Govern- ment has made known that if any of the refugees from Loiidon who came over on the Ctli instant to offer their services to the Holstein authorities, and were refused by them^should be found in Hanover, they will be arrested by the police and imprisoned. Amon<r the number is the ex- aide-de-camp of Georgey, who left him to join General Klapka in Comorn last year. The papers complain of the large quantities of requisitions fur the Danish army, which are being made in Southern Schieswig. Ilusum has to supply daily 16,000 Ib, of bread, other places in proportion. The city of Hamburgh has now ma e up close upon 60,0110 marks for the Sehleswift-Holsteii armr; together with 1 mattresses, 410 blaok'H'.BOO pairs of sheets, 700 hand cloths, 120 pillriw-cases, 1,000 shirts, 1.200 sundry clo:hs and nap- kins, 400 pairs of stockings, 100 dressing-gowns, 100 jackets, 100 pairs of trouBers, 1,000-linen and flannel bindtnga.IO bales of old linen, 1501b. of lint, 1 bhd, of claret, 22,000 cigars, a quantity of other tobacco and refreshments, c111r1, finally, a number of surgic iHnstriimeats. The subsci.iption lists still continue open, and an endeavour is being made to have fome portion of this aid sent to Copenhagen to the prisoners there. HAMBURGH, AUG. 16.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt has been again insinuated in the Danish papers that 'he report in relation to the abdica- tion of the Crown by Frederick VII. at soon as the succes- sion has been arranged, is not without some foundation. His Majesty's left-hauded wife has been raised to the rank 'of Baroness Danner.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThere has been nothing of any con- sequence announced from the scat of war; some rumours of a,mediating influence having been used to terminate the war are afloat, hut nothingon which any credit can he based. The records and principal papers of the Stadthalterschaft are said to have been removed from Kiel to Elinshorn, close to the Elbe; but the Government reinaius pro tem. in Rendsburg at head-quartern. The Kolner Zeitung has a telegraphic despatch from Ham- burgh of the 17th instant, stating that an engagement took place on the evening of the 16tb bet veen a Danish steamer, accompanied by two Hun-boats, and a Holstein steamer (the Lowe), which was likewise supported by two gun-boat<. The combat continued throughout the night, and at half- past seven in the morning the Danish vessels retreated. The Lowe has suffered from the enemy's tire; and one of the gunboats was in danger of being burnt. PRUSSIA AND AUSTRIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe 'earn from a tele- graphic despatch, dated Berlin lith irst., in the Kolner Zeitung, that the Austrian invitation for another Diet (Bundestag) reached Berlin on that day, and that Prussia is resolved to decline accepting any proposal in this or in a similar sense. Berlin tetters of the 16th inst. state, that it is now confirmed by the semi-official organs of the Prussian Government that the differences between Prussia and Aus- tria respecting the interpretation of the regulations 011 the subject of the federal fortresses (differences which resulted from the refusal of Austria to allow the Baden troops to pass the federal fortress of Mentz), are about to be submitted to a Court of Arbitration. Austria has appointed Bavaria. Nothing is known of the Power which Pru-sia will appoint. AUSTRIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdVIENNA, AVG.14.-From impartial sources we learn that the country people in Hungary already begin to discover that a lawful government is far preferable to a revolutionary one. The great nobles, however, are to the full as discontented as formerly. This fact is not calculated to excite astonishment when it is considered that by the re- peal of the feudal laws they have suffered such serious losses that they can no longer indulge in those expensive habits which they had so long been accustomed to consider indispensable. Unfortunately few of the parties in question are in a position to wait until better times, as their property was, previously to the revolution, so heavily mortgaged that they will be necessitated to dispose of a part, aud even in some cases of the whole of their estates, iu order to satisfy the urgent demands of their usurious creditors. This is the true cause of the hostility of the greater part of the Aus- trian aristocracy to the Cabinet, which in secret conclave they accuse. of democratic and revolutionary tendencies. The co'onation of the Emperor presents gieat difficulties. The question is whether he is to be crowned in the separate provinces, as was formerly customary, or once for all at Vienna as Emperor of the United Austrian crown lands. Should the latter measure be decided OUt a difficulty arises \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwhat crown is to be employed? An Imperial-Austrian Crown does not exist, and the archducal oronet will not answer the purpose. This question, which at first sight may seem of secondary importance, is in reality one of vital importance, as it will up to a certain point settle the delicate question of centralization or federation. RUSSIA AND POLAND.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe following account is given of the Russian naval force on the 9th of August: \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The Russian fleet consist- according to official reports, of HiS sail of ships of all sorts and sizus, and are \"s follows:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd 4 line-of-battle ships of 120; 6 of 100 to 110; 26 of SOto 90; 18 of 70 to 80 guns; 30 frigates; 50 corvettes, brigs, and schooners; and 34 tteamers. This nav:11 force is (Ii- vided iuto five aoqua\u00c3\u00b9ron8; tbe l1ahic squadron consists of about 40,000 men, including the artillery; but the paper states that the crews are not of the very best quality of meu, and amongst them are many Jews from Po'.aud. AMERICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLIVERPOOL, AUGUST 17.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBy the Royal mail steam-ship Asia, Captain Judkins, which arrived about half-past seveu this morning, we have advices from Boston to the 7th, and from New York by telegraph, via Halifax, to the 8th inst. She also brings one box of specie on freight. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIu the Senate the Compromise Bill, which had occupied the attention of the house for so many months, was finally disposed of, the bill being carried by a majority of 14.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe disputed question of territory between Texas and New Mexico continued to cre ite much anxiety. Information had been received at Washington that 1,500 men had volun- teered to march against New Mexico, but that the Governor awaited an answer from Washington, and the decision of the Texas Legislature. The New York Herald repot ts that a President's message was daily expected, declaring his intention to protect New Mexico a^ain't any iuvasion by lexas.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe New York Herald. ref>rriug to proceedings in Congress, says\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" On the whole, the aspect of matters in Washington looks favourable to an early and satisfactory adjustment of the wholj slavery question in connexion with the new territories. From present indications the California Bill will pass both houses, a government will he given to New Mexico, the Texan boundory dispute will be arranged, and then Congress will have nothing to do but piss the apnropration bills and go home, unlets they calculate 011 t'nkeiing a little with the tariff. We hardly think, how- ever, that this subject will he meddled with before the next session. The climate of Washington, the heat of the wea- ther, and the labours of the member', together with the toug and arduous ees-ion, must have impaired the health and strength of members more or le^s, and it is very im- probable that they will do any more work, after settling the slavery question and appropriating means for the support of the government.\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA desperde affray oecorred at New York on the 5th instant between the police and a mob com- posed of tailors, in which some lives were loi-t. The dis- turbance was caused by the tailors attacking the house of a mdn who was said to be working at prices below those usually charged.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOur advices from Havannah extend to the 27th ult. The remaining American prisoners continued In confinement, no decisiou having been come to relative to their disposal.

The Vice- roy, who, considering his station, and the infliience he exer- cises over the masses, should show more firmness took to flight from Cairo as soon as the cholera made its appearance there. His highness would not even come to Alexandria, but ordered a steamer and a frigate, well provi-ioned with stores of every description to meet him at Dimietta, to which town he proceeded, down the Nile, and there he ern- barked for Rhodes on the 5th. Some cases of cholera have also occurred at Su. z among the people who had arrived there from Cairo.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMost of the Armenians and other Chris- tians holding authority in the Government of the countrr, from Artin Bey, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, downward-, are in disgrace, and Mahommedan idell. are quite prepon- derant, all the important po.ts being occupied by Turks.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. I FRANCE. I Abroad, as usual, we have to turn to France for dis- quieting indications. The French papers of the week have been full of reports of Socialist meetings, wherein many things which would scarcely have disgraced the year 1 of the Republic, one and indivisible,\" have been said by members of the Assembly. One of the orators told the meeting that the first thing they had to do was to demolish the infamous capital.\" This is what Paris gets for having produced three revo lutions. Another declared that the republic never would be safe till men had renounced the idolatry of the State, Church, and Government.\" A third declared that if France possessed a hundred like himself-the spelkdr-all the thrones of Europe would crumble into dust. At one time the meet- ings are told that the country contains but two classes of men\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdbrigands and Socialists at another, that none ,exist but Socialists and Jesuits then, that the opposite party to their own form a triloge of hangmen, assassins, and cut-throats. And one man, amidst thunders of ap- plause, declared that the time was come to abolish car- riages and vehicles of every description, except for the use of the sick, and to prohibit all articles of silver in domestic use people, he said, could eat very well with wooden forks. The same man, excited by the applause he received, then declared that signal vengeance should be t: ken on those who had destroyed the pure citizens of the 9th Thprrnidor-of the terror, that is. But the most brilliant speech was that of the deputy, M. Michel, of Bonrges. Terror,\" exclaimed this fei vent orator,\" is in the hearts of the enemies of the people \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe people alone form the nation\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdtruth is in their hearts\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin that of all others nothing but a lie. I see,\" he continued. the time approaching; I see a diadem descending on the heads of every one of you --yes, your reign is at hand \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin which you will have to reckon with the bourgeoisie and with royalty.\" This poor bourgeoisie, the vampires and leeches of the country\" as some one called them, is subject to more furious tirades than even the aristocracy \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdits main object is at present, according to these gentle- men, to assassinate the people. M. Michel will be sum- moned before the tribunal for some of his orations\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhe denies certain of his expressions and soften others but he will find it difficult to clear himself Such is a sample, and a very moderate one, of the tone held by the lower orders of France. If these meetings were confined to the capital, it would be easy to check them but they are spread all over the country. With us, too, speechifications of this kind serve as a safety valve, and speakers go home and consider that they have done something and may rest awhile. It is very different oil the other side of the chanor), when every sentence is a blister which never allows rest till it has done its work. At one of these meetings, a curious circumstance oc- curred. According to law, a commissary of police Was present\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdat whom, in his opening speech, the president hurled the usual vituperation. Presently the meeting became stormy\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe president himself was insulted, and obliged to call in the aid of this very commissary. I PRUSSIA. Prussia, who seemed willing to take rather aiarming steps in the Neufehatel affair\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhas quieted down -in de- ference, she states, to the present position of Europe. In fact, no state, except France, is in a more precarious position than herself, or has more to fear from a war. Both Prussia and Austria have protested against that farce in embryo the Erfurt Parliament. I GREECE. IThe blockade of the Piraeus has been raised, by the I mediation of France. I AUSTRIA. Count Anthony Scaparv has been degraded to the rank of a common soldier. When Windischgratz came to Pesth, Szapary separated from the revolutionary party, nnd was suffered to reside unmolested in that city. But it has been since remembered that he took part in the battle of Scitiveeliat, and this handle for including a fresh victim in the list of persecuted Magyars has not been neglected. Count Szapary is past his 50th year, and has two grown-up daughters. Prince Windischgratz is indulging in a fit of the sulks, at Vienna, of so overpowering a nature that he has not yet thought proper to wait upon his imperial master. although he (the Prince) has been more than a week in Vienna.

Lucien Murat going to Constanti- nople in the room of General Aupick, who is recalled. M.de Royer takes the post of Procureur General, vacated by M. Baroche. In the National Assembly on Saturday an angry dis- cussion took place on the interpellations of M. de la Lasteyrie relative to the article in the journal L' As.em- blee X ationale giving the names of certain shopkeepers who had voted for the Socialist candidates. The order of the day was finally carried amidst much confusion, and the house adjourned at a quarter past six o'clock. GERMANY. The Erfurt parliament, summoned in the Prussian interest, meets naxi week with a vieuyto form a federal union. Meantime,the kings of Bavaria, Saxony, and Wurtemburg, countenanced by Austria, have issued a counter project, and asked for it the support of the seve- ral German states. It proposes union on nearly the terms of the old confederation. A coolness between the two governments had led the cabinet of Berlin to recal its minister from the Hanoverian court. THE GREEK COMMERCIAL MARINE During the present blockade of the Greek ports, and the seizure of the Greek ships by the English naval forces, the following statistics of the Greek mercantile navy may be interesting \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe find then in the Morning Chronicle it numbers about 4,000 vessels, with a burden of more than 200,000 tons, exclusive of those sailing under Russian flags, amounting at the present period to about 100 ships. Of the former number 337 are above 100 tons and under 200 tons 200 between 200 tons and 300 tons 41 above 300 tons and the rest are coasters According to the official enumeration, there were, in 1846, 21,500 seamen employed in the Greek vessels their actual number is now reckoned at 40,000. The Isle of Syra is the chief ship-building place of Greece, where not only the Greek marine, but almost all the Turkish, Egyptian, Trieste, and nearly all the ships of the Mediterranean ports, are built. About 300 ships of, the value of half a million sterling, are launched there yearly. The building material is pine. GREECE. Intelligence has at length arrived of the blockade of the Piraeus having ceased, and of the disappearance of all coercive measures except the retention of some fifty small vessels, as security'for the payment of such debts as the French government may award to be justly due. ATHENS, March 5.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAt eight o'clock in the evening of the 1st instant, three hours after the departure of the French steamer for Marseilles, Mr. Green, the English Consul at Athens, issued the following circular \"I am instructed by her Majesty's Minister Pleni- potentiary to the King of Greece, to inform you that her Majesty's Government having good hopes of obtain- ing a satisfactory settlement of their demands on the Greek government, through the good offices of the government of the French Republic, have given orders to Vice-Admiral Sir William Parker to suspend, for a reasonably limited period of time, the coercive action of her Majesty's squadron but nevertheless, to retain the Greek vessels actually in his possession, as pledges in deposit, until a final arrangement shall have been made. Orders have consequently been given by Vice Admiral Sir Wm. Parker to allow for the present the free ingress and egress of all vessels not actually in possession of her Majesty's squadron. I am desired to add that the notification which I had the honour to address you on the 24th January, 1850, is consequently to be considered null and void in all its bearings. (Signed) JOHN GREEN.\" This circular caused a grpat deal of satisfaction throughout Athens. On the 2nd instant, M. Thouvenel wrote to Mr. Wyse, proposing that Sir William Parker should give up the Greek ships in his possession, and that he, the representative of the French Republic, would guarantee for the payment of the claims of her Majesty's govern- ment on Greece. Mr. Wyse replied that he regretted being unable to comply with M. Thouvenel's proposition. That the instructions which he had received from Lord Palmerston did not permit him to accept of such an offer that M. le Gros had, with the approbation of both governments, been appointed to use the good offices of France in settling the difference which existed between her Majesty's government and that of King Otho, and that until M. le Gros' arrival matters must remain in statu quo. M. le Gros arrived here this morning, and has already had an interview with the Miuister of Foreign Affairs. Every unprejudiced person anticipates that the French Envoy's mission will have a most satisfactory result. M. le Gros has not put up at. the French Embassy, but is stopping at one of the public hotels. It is evident he is determined to keep aloof from all party feeling, and to act as one in his position should- with perfect iin- partiality. M. Thouvenel's functions in the present question now cease, and it is with M. le Gros alone that the representative of her Majesty and the Greek gowrn-\u00c2\u00a1' ment will have to treat.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdCor?e?oH?e?? of 1\u00c3\u00afw Times.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY. The great debate on M. de Remusat's motion, in the French Assembly, terminated on tiaturday in the tie- feat of the ministers, by the enormous majority of 139; but the \"\u00c3\ufffddory is not to the Monarchists but to the Republicans, and the defeat, however annoying it may be to the President and his Ministers, is abso- lutely a vote of annihilation to General Changarnier, who was sacrificed by his friends to secure the votes of the Left. The Bui-graves withdrew their own reso- lution, which censured the Ministry for the dismissal .Nlitiisti-i, for the c l isni i ,,Q.i l of Changarnier, am] adopted that o*f M.

Had the original resolution, blaming the dismissal of Changarnier, been persevered in, the Left would have abstained from voting and the :\\linistry would haye triumphed; but to secure the satisfaction of defeating the President the dilicrent Monarchical factions surrendered at dis- cretion to the Republicans, and carried their amend- ment. The Ministers waited on the President of the Republic on Saturday evening, and placcd their re- signations in his hands. It was thought probable that the President would send for either M. de I.a- rnartine, General Cai-aigiiae, M. IJiliault, the Duke de iii-oglie, or M. Odillon Barrett. The Ifimitcur does not announce the acceptance of t he resignation of the Ministry, and it is said that the 1 President has declared if they will stick by him he will stick by them. :\\1. Baroche i. inclined to withdraw his resignation. The new Spanish Ministry is composed as follows 1\\1. Bravo Murillo\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdFinances and President of Coun- oil M. Firmin Arteta-Interior; M. Bertran de las -Foreign Affairs General de Mirasol\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWar; Ad- miral BlIsteJlo.s-1\\Iarjne; M. Negrette\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdGrace and J Justice M. Gonzales Itoiiiero-Public Works. The Belgian Ministers have resigned Ul uttissr, in consequence of the difference of opinion which sprung up lately between the Minister of War (General Brial- mont) and other members of the Cabinet. When the former took office lie expressed his willingness to en- deavour to effect a reduction of the war budget at the rate of 4.30,000 francs per year for the next three years. It may be stated that the present war budget amounts to 20,089,000 francs, an enormous sum for a small country like Belgium. The affair of General Chazal (late Minister of War,) who sent a challenge to one of the Members of the Chamber of Representa- tives, has been amicably arranged. Serious disturbances, in all probability fomented by Greek and Russian agents, have broken out in Cephalonia, Her Majesty's steam-frigate, Spiteful, was dispatched from Malta, on the 10th, with troops, and the Scourge, and a line-of-battle ship, were pre- paring to follow her. Accounts from Constantinople, of the 5th, announce the death of the celebrated Emir Beschir, the Prince of the Mountains. Chaikas, the Hungarian agoi.t, has embraced Islamisin. Advices from Constantinople of the oth announce the arrival of lot) refugees from Shumla. They have- good quarters at Kouleli in the entensivc buildings at present employed at the quarantine establishment. An Austrian vessel has been freighted to convey them to Liverpool, from whence they proceed to the United States. The King of Prussia addressed, on the isth, in honour of the anniversary of' the erection of Prussia into a kingdom, a proclamation to the army. He announces its continued reduction, applauds its carc as shown during the late crisis, and hopes that similar events will call forth an equal display of enthusiasm. At Cassel, on the 10th, the Commissary of Police, Hwnstein, was arrested quite unexpectedly and car- ried before the Council of War. The cause of his arrest is unknown, unless it was that he had refused to submit to the ordinances of September, IS\u00c3\ufffdO. The Austrian troops intended for the occupation of Holstein crossed the Elbe at Artlenbourg on the 17th. The Holstein troops have gone into cantonment. The fortress of Kadstadt in the Grand Duchy of Baden is garrisoned by Austrian troops. The Bava- rian troops will evacuate the territory of Electoral Hesse forthwith; Cassel will be garrisoned by an Austrian and Prussian battallion. ili-i ice Schwart- zenberg arrived in Vienna on the 15th. On that day the first sitting of a jury took place. The crowd in court was enormous. The United States steam-ship Baltic arrived at Li- verpool, on Sunday, with New York advices to the 8th inst. The British steam-ship Niagara reached Boston on the 5th inst. The City of Glasgow screw-steamer arrived at Philadelphia on the 2nd inst. The dates front California are to the 1st of December. A specie train was attacked seven miles out of Panama by a party of lG men, well armed, who succeeded in taking 100,000 dulls\" which was, however, nearly all reco- vered. The dry season was setting in at Chagre,, and the place becoming more healthy. From the mines we learn that many persons had purchased winter sup- plies, with the intention of passing that season at the dry diggings in the mountains. The disappearance of cholera at Sacramento city had caused a revival of business, The rainy season commenced on the 19th of November. Many new veins of ore had been dis- covered. Agriculture was in a flourishing condition. A new branch of commercial activity had been com- menced at San Francisco-that of fitting out winding ships. A regular line of sailing packets had been es- tablished between San Francisco and Panama, touch- ing at Bealejo. The miners in the frontier region of El Dorado and Colvcras counties laboured under much apprehension of hostile Indians, some murders having taken place. The Outfit!)- ami Inquirer announces that official intelligence has been received at Washington, stating that the British Government had directed its agents to suspend the collection of duties at San Juan or Gray town, in Nicaragua. The report of the declara- tiuii of war between St. Salvador and Honduras is confirmed. Mr. Chatfield had intimated that the British Government would interfere. Advices from Mexico to the ltith ult. mention a report that Arista was rapidly forming a Cabinet, A meeting of the French creditors of Mexico had been held, at which the Minister of the Treasury was present. lie expressed a partiality for the French creditors, as they had not oppressed the Republic by means of usurious loans and fraudulent contracts. At Yucatan a battle is reported to have taken place with the Indians, in which the whites were defeated with a loss of oi)0 men. Bolivia was tranquil and business active. The election of President in Peru was to take place on the 20th Dec. An armell hand of robbers is stated to be committing serious depredations at Lima. Chili had been rather disturbed. Advices to the lilst ult. from Kingston, Jamaica, have come to hand. The Great Western arrived on the 2Sth on the north side of the island. The cholera continued to rage with violence at Montego Bay and Falmouth, but in Kingston, Port Royal, and Spanish Town, it had disappeared. Great los had been us- tainctl at Dominica by the overflowing of the river Rosseau, which had been swollen by somo very heavy r3ins; and the neighbouring sea-coast, and also many estates in the interior had sufferered from the heavy torrents of rain, and a vast amount of sugar cane in the plantations, and other property had been destroyed.

{"ocr": "To use the phrase\" noble nation\" with regard to a country whose Legislature has just enforced an act of confiscation as the conclusion of a long course of deli- berate robbery unparalleled in history, seems more or less ubsurd. True it is that the Spanish bondholders of London had announced their submission to the terms of the late law which has mulcted them of half their income. But why did they do so? On that principle which I tcmpts a man to ?i\\c up his money rather than life to a professional highwayman, Signer L?VIVO Iurilto, the SI)?tii?L61i fli)?iiiec knows that now he could not bor-I row another shilling. He knows that he is regarded as the finance minister of a bankrupt and dishonest govern- ment. He must have felt, therefore, that the Spanish nation no more deserved to be addressed as a noble nation,\" by the chairman of the Spanish bondholders, in his late remonstrance on Spanish repudiation, than Jack Shepherd merited the title of noble and honest gentle- man. Yet it may be said that the bondholders were animated by a wish to conciliate-a willingness to give every body, whether nation or individual, the honour to which they may be entitled by force of custom or habit, ;n spite of any crime of which they may have been guilty, and by which they, prima facie, may have rendered them- selves unworthy of such honour. The same motives which prompted the bondholders to address Spain as a noble nation\" animate us in zealously taking the part of Spain with respect to the late most im- pudent attack on her colony\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdCuba, by the riff-raff of New Orleans. Spanish injustice is more than balanced by American rascality. It is well known that we do not respect Spain\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat we doubt whether Queen Isabella's rule be any better than that of the Due de Montcniolin, the legitimate King. Our reasoning is this :Spain has already reached lhe lowest depth of infamy, and consequently, under the son of Don Carlos could not sink lower, nay might rise in the scale of social and political character. This candid con- fession is enough to prove the opinion in which we hold the late expedition of Lopez, when in spite of its being directed against the repudiating Spanish government, we wholly take the part of Spain. It is enough to say that we consider it the most monstrous invasion of interna- tional rights we have ever heard of. W hat is the real history of the -,Ifflil. ? It is NN-Qll known that for many years Cuba has been the object of American covetousness. Commanding the entrance of the Gulph of Mexico, her size, geographical position, and the situation, great strength, and admirable harbour of the Ilavannah render this colony of Spain the mistress of the Gulph. It is, therefore, no wonder that she should he an object of interest to all the nations who carry on trade in the West Indies. But she is more than an object of in- terest to America. Siie is an object of the intensest covetousness of the whole of the United States, espeeially those shire. States bordering on the Gulph, as Florida, kc., and it was, as we all recollect, a moment of anxious ex- citement, when even in lS-K) Lopez and his hand of marauders sailed from New Orleans to revolutionize the island. The then utter failure of that miserable madman excited the ridicule of the world though perhaps the great mode- ration of Spain towards the invaders was too highly praised. Theonly question was, whether or no that expe- dition was undertaken with the sanction or guilty know- ledge of the American government. We strongly inclinc to bclicvc that the government couhlnot but have been aware of the expedition. However, it totally denied the knowledge of a proposed measure with which every child in tIll! Sout/,em States was well acquainted. The dissimulating conduct of the President, as well as the excessive lenicney of the Captain-General, could not but fan the latent spark which, ever since the former failure, has been smouldering, and whicli the other day again, under the influence of that Inciter Lopez, burst forth- again to be extinguished\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthis time in blood. ()f the dishonesty of Spain to its hondhol,1crs--of the justice of her cause in the matter of Cul)a-of the well-deserved punishment of the plundering marauders, we have not the slightest doubt. Nor for our own part, can we refrain from Joining the radical Sun newspaper, in believing that this time the American government really favoured and secretly assisted the expedition. We have as yet only assertion and denial on one side and the other. But what are the probabilities ? Wo sce that the United States have got bolll ufCaiifornia, Xcw Mexico and Texas. Would not the possession of Cuba be more yaluable to the Union, especially the slave States, than any one of them ? But why to the slave Slates especially ? Because the slave trade and slavery are rapidly diminishing in Cuba, and it is the interest of the Carolinas, &c. to prevent this desirable issue. As long as Cuba remains under the dominion of Spain, or becomes perfectly independent, we need not fear for our West Indian Colonies. It must never helowj to the L mted States. Recollect that Jamaica is not so far off. and that ever since republics were first instituted they have never remained in statu quo. All history warns us of this, from that of the Roman Republic downwards. Let not, then, Americans get off with the excuse that the bone ot contention is between Spain and America only. England does not want Cuba, though, considering the im- mense debt owed to her London bondholders by Spain, England would be far more justified in seizing Cuba than any other nation; and certainly she has most right, if she refuses to seize it herself, to prevent a rabble of slave holding marauders, who have no claim whatever, from laying hands on a country which Britain woulll at any time be justified in holding as a security for the pavnient of her debts.", "word": "1", "description": "\u2026 that for many years Cuba has been the object of American covetousness.

President Fillmore had issued a proclamation against the fitting out in the United States of invading expeditions, more especially as regarded Mexico. It was said that a commissioner lnd been appointed to China. The yellow fever had appeared at Mobile. A meeting on behalf of the pardon and release of Smith O'Brien and the other Irisllrchcls had been held at Boston, at which it was agreed to petition President Fillmore to use his influence for the purpose.

As Great Britain does not usually leave such things half done, it is probable that she will not long- delay taking ample vengeance for this insult to her flag, and that a sufficient force will soon be sent to make the Arabs feel the consequents of their piratical conduct.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY. P Account from Rome of the 30th ult ?ate that Lord Palmerston had addressed a sharp remonstrance to the P\"Val Court on account of the unjustifiable manner in which Mr. Hely, a British subject, had been expelled from Kome. The only cause of complaint alleged against Ir. .'v was that he was thcbrotherin taw off\"?\"d AchUh. It is said that the Pope personally was opposed to the recent establishment of the English hierarchy, and that he now regrets having given way to the in- stanecs of the \"Propaganda fide.\" The Anti-Popery demonstrations in England have produced much aiarm in the College of Cardinals. The of the 6th inst. contains the fol- lowing. I have been assured that Lord Mlnto has written n letter to a high personage here respecting the Catholic hierarchy in England, with a recommendation that it be communicated to the Court of Rome. I am informed that it has been read to r. de Rayneval, the French Minister, who, being the most zealous and officious friend of the Vatican, will make it known to his Holiness. It is said that Lord Minto describes the embarrassment in which the Government of her Britannic Majesty is placed, and as- cribes to the want of prudence with which the bull, erect- iug Westminster into a diocese, has been published, the painful consequences the Hoarnn Catholics shall have to undergo, should the present Ministry not be able to pro- tect them and treat them with the impartiality which characterises the policy of Lonl John Russell. 1,onl Minto, it appears, concludes by expressing a hope that the l'ope will adopt some measures calculatell to ren,e\u00c3\u00b9 thc nil and calm the gelwraleffcrvescencc of the couutr).\" The British people, if we mistake not, will rectify the evil themselves without regard to the feelings of the Pope or the Premier, between whom the meddling Minto seems to be a sort of gossip. A letter from Bologna, of the aOth ult.. states that the theatrical agent Tinti had been ordered to quit that city in 24 hours. This measure was not adopted from any political motive, but was ascribed to the malice and envy of some rivals. The diroctor of the theatre had cut his throat with a penknife.

{"ocr": "LYNCHING IN AMERICA. The following very remarkable narratives are extracted from the American Flag of the 17th ult., published in the district of Rio Grande;- On the 11th instant oqr citizens were astounded with the melancholy inte ligence that Justice Beacon, in consequence of the death of the coroner, had been called to hold an inquest over the body of Captain John Brennan, who had been murdered in cold blood by the notorious Bill Hardy, both recently from Galveston. It appears that the above two with a number of otheis, were at the Landango-houser, where they remained till between one and two o'clock in the morning, when Captain Brennan left for h's place of lodging. He had not proceeded far when he was overtaken by Hardy, who drew his knife and thrust it to the hilt in Brennan's left breast. Seeing Hardy's movements he threw up his hands, and exclaimed, Bill, don't cut me It was too late, the fatal stab came too quick and too certain for him to avoid it. He ran some 30 or 40 yards, fell, and soon expired. After committing the outrage, Hardy walked back into the house, with his knife in his hand, reeking with blood, exclaiming, ''I'm a tart, and that's the way I'll serve any man who will follow me.\" Some of those who heard him, supposing he had got into difficulty with a Mexican, advised him to leave, which he did. As soon as it was ascertained that he had killed Captain Brennan, men were sent to the several ferries to prevent his escape into Mexico, and others started in pursuit. He was arrested next morning about daylight, near one of the ferries, ironed, gnd taken to gaol. The cause of this brutal outrage is assigned to the lefusal of Brennan to let Hardy have money while at Brazos, which is, in all probability, the true cause, as Hardy was heard to say, on the way up to that place, that he had marked his man. The people resolved to mete out justice to the murderer, and they accordingly assembled, and demanded the culprit from the deputy sheriff, who was obliged to deliver up the man into their hands. On reaching the spot for the performance of this tragic scene, he remarked that he knew he had to die and intended to die like a man, but would rather be shot than hung. The crowd assembled to witness the solemn tragedy was quite large, but orderly and quiet with a few exceptions. No one volunteering to shoot the guilty wretch, it was decided that he must hang. During all this time, and even while the arrangements were making for launching him into eternity, where he would meet a more dtead tribunal than any one on earth, he evinced the most perfect indifference as to his fate, not suffering a muscle of his face or limbs to betray the slightest emotion, and even took the rope that was to hang him, and tied the hangman's knot to show how it was done, without the slightest perceptible tremor of the neives. Those managing the matter, fearing the knot was not well tied, untied it for the purpose of retying, in which they failed, when he remarked to a gentleman standing near him that he would tie it again. This kind office the individual addressed promised to perform for him. The doomed man then got into a cart, mounted on a plank which rested on the wheels, without any resistance or assistance, and while the rope, which was suspended from a beam used for hoisting beeves, was being adjusted round his neck, asked to have his haCids tied behind him. There he stood, high above the crowd, his hands tied, the noose closed about his neck, and Death staring him in the face, calm, cool, and collected. The cart moved from under him, and in this condition he was hurried into eternity. He died after a slight struggle and thus terminated the earthly career of Bill Hardy. He met death with the same reckless indifference that he had meted it out to others. On last Tuesday morning, our city was made the scene of another bloody tragedy, when our citizens again took the law into their own hands, and meted out justice to a brutal wretch who had set at defiance the law of God and man. From what we can learn of the occurrence, the particulars are as follows :-A Mexi- can went into the house of M'Kee, where a monte- bank is kept, and asked another young Mexican for a bit. Tne individual who was dealing monte at the time remarked that he would give it to him, which he did. In the meantime he had drawn his pistol, which, on receiving the money, he fired at the Mexican first addressed. The pistol was loaded with buckshot, two of which struck the young man fired at in the breast, near the throat, and a third wounded another Mexican in the arm. As soon as he had committed the foul deed he ran to the river, and attempted to effect his escape into Mexico by swim- ming. Several shots were firsd while he was in the water, but none hit him. He was pursued by several persons in a skiff, caught, and brought back. He was then taken to see the man whom he had shot, who was suffering greatly, thence to the place where Hardy was executed, and there hung. It did not exceed 20 minutes from the time he discharged his pistol till he was dangling at the rope's end. No cause has been assigned for the cold-blooded act. The young man who was shot in the breast died shortly after his murderer was hung. The house of Mr. G. L. Stillwell, nine miles the other side of the Rio Colorado, containing his family and four Mexicans, was attacked on the 10th instant by eleven Indians, who surrounded the premises, and kept up a constant fire for about half an hour, without doing any other injury than killing two horses that were tied at the door. One of the party then came forward at what he no doubt considered a safe distance, as if to challenge, when Mr. Stillwell shot him dead. The party then left, taking away three horses, and made towards Brownsville. It is supposed that this party were among those who attacked Mr. Holbrook and a Mexican, a part of Mr. Stilwell's party.\"", "word": "1", "description": "\u2026 will follow me.\" Some of those who heard him, supposing he had got into difficulty with a Mexican, advised him to leave, which he did.

A minority of the committee reported against the mea- sures. CUBA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe New York papers contain lengthy accounts of a reported insurrection in CUUI. which should, however, be received with caution. The Tribune says :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd \"The pronunciamento lor Cuban independence was made on the 4th of July, signed by the principal leaderg of the revolt, Aguero Aguero, Aguero Estrada, aud Artiaga Pina, as provi- sional representatives of the people1 of Cuba. After enume- rating the principal grievances which the island has suffered from Spanish rule, this instrument declares that Cuba is, and by the laws of nature ought to be, independent of Spain, and owes\" submission only to the authority of these who, while awaiting the action of the people, are provisionally intrusted with the command of each locality and of the military forces. The first real battle of the patriots took place after the issuing of the pronunciamento. A party of Government troops, which had been sent out to make prisoners of the revolutionists, fell in with a gtrttrilla force under Aguero Aguero, on the 4th of July, at the foot of the Cascorro mountains. On the previous day a skirmish occurred, in which the patriot leader Sanchez was taken prisoner, and a few arms were captured by the Spanish troops. In the engagement on the 4th the Cubans numbered 200 men, and the Spaniards 300 men, consisting of 100 Lancers and 2^0 infantry. After a vigorous contest the Spaniards retreated, having lost 21 killed, including the captain, and 18 wounded. The loss on the Cuban side was slight, only two or three having been wounded, and none killed. 12 of the Spanish troops deserted their colours and joined the patriots. The effect of this battle was to inspire the people with fresh confidence, and they soou increased the number of insurrec- tionists to over 1,000. Hiey \\^re divided into five guerilla parties of 200 men each, which were stationed in the strong- holds about Cascorro and Puerto Principe, where they were drilled in military exercises, and received strong accessions to their numbers. After the engagement of the 4th the Spanish troops fell back on Principe, some 17 leagues from Cascorro. The announcement of the victory, of the insurgents produced great excitement among the people of l'rincipe. Nothing but the great number of sotdiersmthe garrison, over 4,000, pre- vented a great massacre of the troops. The general did not dare to send out a force in pursuit of the Cubans, for fear of a popular rising, and despatched messengers to Havannah for a reinforcement of 2,000 men. The insurgeuts, meanwhile, were gaining strength and confidence. There are rumours of several other engagements, in which the Government troops were defeated, but thus far we have not sufficiently direct ac- counts to furnish materials for an opinion.\"", "word": "1", "description": "\u2026, caused by the reports of a rising at Puerto.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. Considerable agitation still prevails among the prisoners at Belle-Isle. The Governor having offered to Blanqui, Barbes, and other leaders, to release them from the close confinement in which they have been kept since the last outbreak, the prisoners refused to avail themselves of the offer, unless all their fellow-prisoners were released with them. This the Government is afraid to do, as it is expected that the two factions, into which the prisoners are divided, will immediately recommence hostilities. Three waggons laden with 36 cases of muskets destined for Strasbourg, have been seized at Chalons-sur-Saoae, and the parties in charge of them arrested. The state of Portugal is still extremely critical. By a Royal decree of the 21st ult. the Cortes were dissolved, and convoked again for the 15th of September, for the revision of the Constitution.Another decree restores to their rights and their seats in the Senate 27 Peers of the old families who had signed the requisition to Don Miguel in 1828, and have ever since been ostracised. It has also been officially announced that the dividends on the public debt will continue to be paid as heretofore, and a commission has been appointed to examine into the financial condition of the country. Thus far all wears a favourable aspect; but unfortunately a counter-revolution has broken out, three squadrons of cavalry, and a battalion of artillery having pronounced against Saldanha, and the province af Estre- madura having declared its adhesion to the Charter and the Queen, and its opposition to the revolutionary party. The Queen has, during these difficulties, had the comfort of the presence of the Duke and Duches of Saxe-Cobourg Gotha, who have been staying with hor at the Palace of the Necessidades. A decree has been published at Rome, dated May the 16th, and signed by Cardinal Antonelli, which, with the view of guaranteeing the free exercise of legitimate action, provides that any person guilty of preventing another from the free use of tobacco, shall within the term of 24 hours after conviction be sentenced to the galleys for a period of from one to three years, with a proviso that in cases of aggravated offence the penalty will be increased. The same stringent law applies to the distribution of prints and writings of an alarming or revolutionary tendency. By way of making the Romans understand that this is no Irutum fulmca the Giornale di Iloma of the 17th publishes a sentence of the Supreme Tribunal of the Sacred Consulta, condemning Pietro Ercoli. aged 34, to the galleys for 20 years, for having on the night of the 10th of May attempted to prevent one Luigi Gianni from lighting a cigar he wanted to smoke. An extraordinary congregation, or commission, composed of six Cardinals, has been appointed by the Pope for the purpose of inquiring into the moral state of the convents, and report- ing on the best mode of reforming the abuses which have crept into these establishments. The Tuscan Government, which has recently been pursuing a career of oppression and tyranny, has again got into trouble. A riot took place at Florence on the 29th ult., in the course of which the people were fired upon, and two killed and seven or eight wounded. UNITED STATES. The apportionment of representatives under the new census has been published by the United States Cabinet. It gives to New York alone no less than 32 members. The intelligence from the South is unfavourable to the preservation of the Union, at least if big words are to be taken as indications of coming deeds. The Southern Rights Conven- tion, at Charleston has concluded its sittings, and its resolutions are pregnant with threats of secession. A grand military encampment has been assembled at Orangeburg, in South Carolina, at which a similar spirit prevailed. There can no longer be any doubt of the tact that another invasion of Cuba was in contemplation. A proclamation of General Lopez has been published at Havana, announcing his intention to effect a landing, and calling npon the inhabitants to collect under his standard. The scheme has, however, been nipped in the bud. Numerous arrests have been made in Florida and Georgia, and a body of 1,.J.dO buccaneers, who have assembled on the coast, has been dis- persed. So effectual are these measures considered by the States Government, that a steamer, chartered for the pur- pose of watching the expedition, has been re-delivered to its owners. Accounts have been received at New Orleans from Tehaun- tepec, Mexico, according to which the Mexicans had refused to allow the landing of cargo from the United States, and even passengers who had arrived by an American steamer had been detained. Telegraphic intelligence from the city of Mexico of the 3rd ult., received in New York, via New Orleans, confirms this report. CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. The latest intelligence from the Cape reaches to the 7th of April. The Governor was at William's Town, directing inroads upon the enemy's territory along the frontier, for the purpose of preventing the Caffres from gathering their crops. A salutary effect had been produced upon the minds of the Kat river Hottentots, by the fact that one ot them has been roasted by the Caffres, the result of which has been an increased attachment on their part to British protection. Sandilla was believed to have a large camp in the Amatolas. The view taken by the local papers of the aspect of the war, is by no means favourable to its speedy termination. The Zuid Africaner of the 7th of April says\" With the Gaikas at open war\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwith a reinforcement in their ranks from the 'Slambies\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwith the connivance of the Amagalekas -with the Tambookies and almost every native Chief throughout. British Caffrarie and the the Sovereignty in arms -and the Hottentot rebellion and defection in the army to boot-what actual prospect is there, we presume to ask, of a speedy termination of hostilities? With such facts on record, no general order can have any effect. The danger is not diminishing, but progressive, and the worst part of the present rupture may yet have to be enacted.

{"ocr": "FRANCE. We have received the Paris journals of Saturday. The Constitutionnel publishes a long article, extending over nearly a page, the object of which is to show that the Repub- lic, with the renewed Presidency of Louis Napoleon Bona. I parte, is. at the present moment, the only possible government for Fiance. It is addressed principally to the Legitimates and Orleanists, advising them to co-operate in the establish- ment of a reasonable and acceptable Republic, which should have the effect of inculcating a love of order in the public mind, and 'hat respect for institutions, without which neither branch of the Bourbons, if it were to recover power, could long retain it. The writer does not believe that either the Count de Chambord, or the Count de Paris has much chance of a throne at present but he docs not wish to till them utterly with discou agement. What he desires is, that, for their own sake, and iir the good of France, both branches should conform to circumstances, and think of society before they occupy themselves with questions of personal ambition The Assembly, on Friday, rejected the first clause of the Usury Bill, by a majority of 336 to 293. The clause was as ioIJows Any stipulation, which, in a loan at interest, has for its object to exceed the amount fixed by law, constitutes the offence of usury, no matter what may be the combinations em. ployed for the sake of disguising it.\" M. de St. Priest announced that, notwithstanding the main feature of the Bill was destroyed, he should still proceed with the other clauses. During the sitting of the Assembly, on Saturday, General Schramm, the minister at war, presented a Bill, demanding an extraordinary credit of 3,2HUjOlf, t< r keeping on a war foot- ing the army of occupation at Rome during the lii-st six months of 1851. This credit, he observed, was calculated on the number of 10,000 infantry, and 1,500 cavalry. The number of French troops at present in Italy wak, he s4d, 14,000 in fantry and 2,000 cavalry, but the government expected to be able to reduce that force to the number mentioned above. In general,\" continued General Schramm, the situation of the Roman States has considerably improved. Still we cannot as yet state the moment when the presence of our troops may be dispensed with. In the impossibility at the present mo ment of our being able to assign a term to the occupation, we conceive that, as the assembly granted the government'the credits required to pay the expenditure of 1850, it will not re- bise to grant the funds of 1851.\" ITALY. Letters from Rome, of the 7th, state that the anti-Papist demonstrations in England had created alarm among the direc- tors of the Obscurantist conspiracy, and that orders had been sent to Cardinal Wiseman to abstain from taking any further proceedings in the matter until the affair should have some- what blown over. The French garrison is to be diminished to a battalion in the Castle of St. Angelo, and two battalions at Civita Vecchia. The military posts in the country are to be occupitd by Neapolitan troops. A Roman paper of the bth instant, contains the following, dated Rome, 30th ult, Lord Minto has written a letter to a high personage here, respecting the Catholic hierarchy in England, with a recommendation that it be communicated to the Court of Rome. It has been read to M. de llavneval, the French minister, who, being the most zealous and ojjjeious friend of the Vatican, will make it known to his Holiness. It is said that Lord Minto describes the embarrassment in which the British government is placed, and ascribes to the want of prudence with which the bud, erecting Westminster a diocese, has been published, the painful consequences the Roman Catholics will have to undergo, should the present ministry not be able to protect them, and treat them with the impartiality which characterises the policy of Lord John Russell. Lord Minto concludes, by expressing a hope that the Pope will adopt some measure calculated to remedy the evil, and calm the general effervescence of the country.\" The Tuscan Monitore of the 7th publishes the terms and the ratifications of the postal treaty lately concluded between Austria and Tuscany. Besides this treaty, a special funda- mental convention has been signed between the two govern- ments for an Austro-fta ian postal league, which all the o her governments may join. GERMANl.

This arrest causcd some sensation in Carlsbad. The Cologne Gazette states from Merlin, of the 11th, that M. dt? Raumer has accepted the place of minister of worship. General de Grobow was the day before received in private audience by the King and Prince of Prussia. He is to be charged with a secret mission for the Court of St. Petersburg! A letter from Vecha, of the 10th, in the German Journal of Fraiiktolt, says \"The greatest part of the Prussian troops have now eva- cuated the line of occupation and the trontler; According to the new orders, they will not be replaced, or, if they are, by only a small body of men.\" A letter from 'Hanau ot the I I th, states that the day before, a revolt cook place amongst the prisoners in the gaol, in con- sequence of their trials having been postponed to another ses- ion. owing to political events.

A Pera correspondent of the Ost Deuttche Post gives some interesting details relative to the conspiracy recently dis- covered at Constantinople. By a singular chance the Sultan himselt found certain suspicious documents in the room of one of his adjutants, the Bimbaschi Mustapha Effendi, who was arrested with twelve other persons of high standing in the seraglio The conspiracy was directed against the Sultan and Rescind Pasha's Cabinet. Abdul Assis, the Sultan's brother, if not actually a sharer in the conspiracy, certainly connived at the revolutionary movements which have so fortunately been brought to light. The Sultan's physician, an Austrian, was sent for by his Imperial master, who, after dismissing his first chamberlain, conversed with the doctor for a whole hour. The same evening the latter left Constantinople for Trieste with his wife and family. The disciple of CEsculapius, whose monthly salary was 9,000 piastres, was in the habit of 1 eceiving very costly presents from his munificent employer. His house in Constantinople, which is now for sale, was a present of the Empress Mother's it is valued at \u00c2\u00a3 8,000. In an Aleppo letter of the 9th November, mention is made of the defeat of the rebels by Keritn Pacha. On a subsequent day, the insurgents having been reinforced, again appeared before the city, and were again routed, leaving 100 prisoners and 3,000 sheep behind them. The garrison of Aleppo is now so strong, that nothing more is to be feared. INDIA AND CHINA. We have received telegraphic dispatches from Trieste, in anticipation of the overland mail. The Europa arrived at Trieste on the 13th instant, at 8 45 A.M., from Alexandria direct, after a passage of 136 hours.

The Hindostan steamer arrived at Suez at midnight on the 4th instant., with ninety passengers, and advices from Canton of the 28th of October, Calcutta November 8, and Bombay November 16. The political intelligence from India presents no feature of extraordinary interest. From China we learn that to all appearances the troops are gaining the upper hand over the insurgents. Trade is rather brisk in China and at Calcutta; dull at Bombay. AMERICA. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. LIVERPOOL, TUESDAY MORNING.-Tlie British and North American Koyal Mail steam-ship Niagara has just entered the Mersey, with the latest news from New York. She left on the 4th instant. The Niagara has encountered heavy gales, which accounts, in some measure, for her lengthened pasage. By this arrival we have the President's Messsge, as delivered on the 4th instant, at Washington. The leading recommendations of the President's messace are as follow 11 inlutijal reproach and recrimination, leading to useless irritation among the several members 01 the Union, should be avoided and deprecated. All laws, while they exist, must be enforced and obeyed, whether popular or obnoxious. The President must see the law enforced, without exception or discrimination. It any act should pass both Houses of Congress, which should ap. pear to him unconstitutional, or an encroachment on the just rights of other departments, or provisions hastily adopted and likely to produce consequences injurious and unforeseen he wtli, consider it his duty to apply the veto power confided to him by the constitution, and arrest it. Forei.-ii relations generally are amicable and satisfactory. U ith Portugal, Brrzil, Chili, Peru, and tbe Hawaiian kingdom they are improved or improving. Mexico is being impora.ned o grant a more unrestricted right of way lor a railroad across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; and tbe President hopes he shall arrange with Great Britain respecting the ocean ship. canal through Nicaraguil. \"He says that a treaty has been ratified by the United States and Great Britain for facilitating and constructing a ship-canal to connect the Atlantic with the Pacific, at that point; and but two objects in connexion with it remain to be accowplithed,-viz., the designation and establishment of a free poit ai each end of the canal, and filing a distance from each shore, within which, belligerent operations shall not be carried on. \"The receipts into the Treasury during the fiscal year, Which closed with June last, were nearly 47J millions. The federal revenue should be raised mainly by duties on imports. Those duties should be so levied as to benefit in- cidentally home industry, by shielding it from destructive foreign competition. They should not be exorbitant, but moderate should be specific as far as possible and when- ever ad valorem rates are tolerated, they should be computed on the home, instead of the foreign valuation. Mr. Fillmore recommends that California have a branch mint, and meantime gold stamped by the United States assayer should be received in payment.

Sir George Simpson had returned to Lachine, after having made a tour through the interior of the Hudson's Bay terriioiy, but without hearing anything of the Franklin expedition. From details of the intelligence from California we learn that the aspect of affairs was satisfactory. SaD Francisco was rapidly recovering from the late fire; Ihe buildings erecting were fireproof deal. The yield of gold was not abundant, the water being very high in many places. The prorogation of the Canadian parliament took place on the 10th. The President is reported to have received informa- tion of the formation of another expedition to Cuba from Pori Rico.

Don Mugica y Ossorio, the new governor of Puebla, has taken active measuies to check the cholera. The cholera has disappeared entitely in Guanajuato, and was disappearing also in Tucubaya. Don Manuel Payno is recommended for the place of Minister of Finance. WEST INDIES. Intelligence had been received from Havanna relative to the remainder of the Cuba prisoners. Seven of tbem are to be liberated in Ihfcourse of the month the other three are to have eight years of the chain gang. This is ihe wind-up of Lopez s piratical invasion of Cuba. There were unauihenticated ru- mours afloat of a second Cuban expedition in preparation and etraoge story of a plot to dissever the union, in which Lopez was aaid to imphcated. It was asserted at New Orleans on the 10th instant, that Governor Bell had issued commissions in Texas for raising troops in almost every country to march for Santa Fe, on the 1st of September, There was some prospect 01 an Indian war on the frontier. CALIFORNIA. The emigrations to California continued unabated. On the 13th instant three steamers left New York for Chagres with passengers. The latest news from California was brought to New York by the Georgia and Cherokee, steam ships the former (which carried the mails) lell Charges on the 26th of July and reached New York on the 14th instant; the latter left Charges on the 27th and reached New York on the 13th. The dales from San Francisco are to the 1st of J uly-13 days later than had been previously received. The Cherokee had on board over two millions of dollars in gold dust, of which to the vatue of lour hundred tbousaod dollars was io the hand\" of passengers. Tbe Califoinians were anxiously awaiting the decision of Con- gress on the question of their reception. Colonel Benton says there must soon be two states carved out of Cattfornia tbe atructure of the country renders the expense of one government for the whole too great. The San Franciscans were rapid.y reo pairing the damage done by the fire. The watets were abating, and the diggings were again becoming accessible.

It set! fx;c<ed that the House of Representatives would shortly enter upon the discussion of and pass the measures seat down from the Senate on the Californian and other questions of a similar kind. Out of Con- C8s much interest, and perhaps some anxiety, had !'n caused by reports of an unpleasant nature from Texas relative to the policy of that state towards New Mexico. At the date of the Governor's message the Senate had not passed the 10,000,000 Dollars In- demnity Bill to recompense Texas for the country to New Mexico. Accounts from New Mexico report \u00e2\ufffd\u00a0yerv curious and discreditable proceedings on the part of the new authorities of that embryo state. Rumours were current in Washington to the effect that a mis- understanding existed in the Cabinet; and that there had been extensive frauds by the Government officers in California. The advices from California were very favourable, The discoveries of gold were increasing. Sacramento city was steadily progressing and im- proving, not only in business, but in size. The city had doubled in population since last March. There had been some fighting with the Indians at Trinity City the Indians being the assailants. The Indian town was thereupon captured and burnt, and three Indians were taken, tried by jury, and shot. Professor Webster had lately confessed, it is asserted, a premeditated arrangement for the murder of Dr. Parkman. On the 30th ult., the guilty man was to be executed. Advices from Canada, dated Toronto, August 22,\" state that great excitement had been created by the secret sale by Government of public roads that cost 900,000 dollars, for 300,000 dollars. Public opposition was so strongly expressed that the Govei ment had determined to repudiate the bargain. The Mexican advices extend to the 27th of July. The cholera was disappearing from Vera Cruz, but at Puebla it was increasing fearfully. The Mexican papers were almost unanimously opposed to the Te- hantepec treaty, on the ground that it gave the United States too strong a power over the southern frontier. We have late advices from Havannah. The officers connected with the Lopez expedition were still in confinement; but it was confidently expected that thev would shortly be released. From Hayti we hear of the' settlement of the dispute between that Republic and Dominica. We have Venezuelan advices to the 3rd ult. It was the general opinion at Puerto Cabello that General Guzman would be the successful candi- date for the Presidency. The election was proceeding tranquilly. The usual dispatches in anticipation of the Overland Mail, which left Bombay on the 25th of July, were received in London on Monday, and announced the suicide of Colonel King, commanding her Majesty's 14th Light Dragoons. A private of the regiment was sentenced some time back to receive corporal punish- ment for charging the Colonel with cowardice, stating that he ran away at Chillianwallah. The prisoner was brought on parade for punishment in a state of pal- pable intoxication, having been ellowed to get drunk in the guard-room while under sentence; the punish- ment, was, nevertheless, proceeded with. When freed from the triangles the prisoner, infuriated by pain and drink, (he had drunk in the guard-room near two bottles of spirits,) becoming, as might have been foreseen, outrageous alld allusive, rushed up to the Colonel, and in the presence of the whole regiment, repeated his former charge, for which he was again placed in confinement, and sentenced by a court- martial to transportation for seven years, which sen- tence the Commander-in-Chief refused, under the circumstances of the case, to sanction, and ordered the man to return to his troop. The remarks of the Commander-in-Chief on this trial, added to what he had said at Lahore (\"that the men of the 14th would go anywhere if properly led\"), stung Colonel King so deeply as to induce him to commit suicide. The Affreedees have again closed the pass to Kohat, and seem inclined to be as troublesome as ever. A man of the Horse Artillery has been shot by one of them close to his quarter guard. A plot has been dis- covered for effecting the release of the 10 Seikh state prisoners confined at Allahabad. General Campbell has returned to the Punjaub, but a large party of officers still remain at Cashmere, where they are treated by Ghoolab Singh with the utmost kindness and attention. The south-west monsoon, so long de- layed, had at last set in in earnest, and all apprehen- sions of famine in Western India were at an end. In Bengal the rains were injuriously heavy for the in- digo cultivation, and there were great floods in the neighbourhood of Calcutta-the course of the intended railway to Budram being described as at present a sea of inundation better adapted to the operation of | steam-boats than steam-carriagts.\" The Hon. Com- pany's cargo boat Kaleegunga, in tow of the steamer Berhampooter, at Patna, left Allahabad with 39 Seikh convicts with a very weak guard. The arms of the guard were piled between them and the convicts when at Patna the latter having seized the firearms which wore loaded, rose upon the guard, and a desperate conflict ensued. Two of the guard and two of the convicts were killed, and the convicts succeeded in running the boat ashore and escaping. Melbourne papers to the 16th of May bring intelli- gence of tIe commencement ofaii open and determined agitatioa of the question of the severance of the Australian colonies from the mother country. The agitation has been originated by the Rev. Dr Lang, a Presbyterian minister and old colonist, who, it will be remembered, published lately in the English papers a >lron<'lv-written letter to the Colonial Secretary re- garding the misusage of their colonies by the Colonial uthce. Dr. Lang appears to have been subsequently ca,t into prison arbitrarily for some matter of debt, to the great displeasure of the Melbourne public, who were rrisiog a subscription to procure his release. The mining interest at Adelaide is in a flourishing state, and the total proceeds of copper-mines during the last 4i yeirs are estimated at \u00c2\u00a3 592,202. Gold-washing liascommenced w ith sufficient prospect of success to stop emigration to California. Experiments have been made on the sands from the bed of the Unksparinga, a stream south of Adelaide, with a newly-invented machine, capable of washing from 25 to 30 tons per dav. Two ounces of gold were obtained from 1601b. of sand. Very promising indicationsof coal have been met with on the south side of Kangaroo Island. A newspaper in the German languoge, called the fiuetl- Auftralhche Zeitmnj, has been established in Adelaide, and appears to he conducted with great ability. It circulates chiefly among the German immigrants, whose numbers are increasing last. The China mails are to the 23d of June. Considera- ble sickness prevailed at Hong-Kong, upwards of 100 of her Majesty's 59th Regiment being in hospital at oil(- time. On the 13th the barque Elizabeth Ainslie, lrom Calcutta, was destroyed by tire, with 300 chests of opium and 1,200 bags of saltpetre on board. Go- vernor lionham had arrived at Shanghai, but nothing more lias transpired relative to the mission of her Majesty's sloop Hey nard to Pekin, or rather to the I'ciho, A rcpori was current in Shanghai that the Reynard had grounded on the bar at Tien-tsin and been tired into by the Chinese. The new Governor of Macao, Senhor Da Cunlia, hz s arrived in China, together with three small ships of war and about 1,000 troops. Communications have passed between him and the Impcrial Commissioner, but their precise nature has not transpired. It is rumoured that he is instruced to demand the absolute cession of the penin- sula of Macao to the Portuguese, and the withdrawal of all Chinese posts within a certain distance, together with the expense of the present expedition. His force 1> however, considered insufficient fer energetic coer- cive measures should his demands be refused. The dates from Alexandria are to the 21st of August. Choiera continued to prevail throughout the country. At Alexandria there were about fifty deaths daily, at Cairo double the number, and throughout the Delta it t xists more or less. Ahbas Pacha, the Viceroy, had gone down the Damietta branch of the Nile, and stays alternately at Mauxourah and Damietta. His High- ness has a steamer in readiness for him at the mouth of the Nile, to embark, should the cholera assume any degree of intensity in his vicinity. The West India steamer brings late advices from all the islands. Heavy rains had fallen in several parts and the weather had proved stormy to the northward,, and in some cases disastrous to the shipping. In Bar- badoes the Sugar orop was 35,350 hhds., being the largest ever known, especially taking into consideration that the barrels were of an increased size. In Grenada the weather had been very boisterous, and a deluge of rain had fallen in St.Lucia. The manufacturing process had closed for the season, consequently the weather would not cause much inconvenience. The growing fields derived great benefit on the hill sides, but the bottom lands suffered from the wet. The young cotton plants were thriving. At Antigua, the new private bank established by Mr. Eldridge was doing well. In Jamaica matters were progrsssing much as before; nnd in Demerara Coolie immigration was under discussion. The Venezuela accounts furnish us with a copy of the energetic protest addressed by the British Charge d'Affaires at Caraccas, Mr. Belford Hinton Wilson, to the Government there, on the subject of the late debt confiscation, and agreeably with the decree of the Congress, President Monagas had authorised proper =.'n,.tion to be made to the parties who had suf- fered by it. Letters from Rio Janeiro, dated July 6th, confirm the intelligence relative to the demolition of a fort and capture of four prizes by the Cormorant. Mr. Hudson, the English Consul, is said to have disowned the pro- ceedings, and consequently his passports have not been tendered. The commander of the Cormorant was understood to have received his orders direct from England hut it is most probable that he acted upon his own judgment in the responsible position in which he was placed, and, like a true Briton, finding that one of his men was killed and others wounded, while he was in the discharge of his duty, by the fort wan- tonly firing upon his vessel, did not hesitate to anchor close to the battery and demolish it, leaving not one stone upon another. He ought to have the thanks of his country. The Danes, on one side, and the Schleswig-Hol- steiners, on the other, still maintain delensive posi- tions, but each appear to dread a battle, which might, indeed, terminate in momentary victory to one party, but could not ensure it against the pretensions of the other. It is to be hoped that further bloodshed may be prevented bv the diplomatic negotiations that are in progress between the powers interested. It is calculated that the journey of the President of the French Republic, with his suite, cost twenty-four thousand francs a day, taken from the secret funds and from the President's income. The government have received telegraphic despatches from several de- partments, reporting that the councils general have expressed their wishes that there should be an imme- diate revision of the constitution and that the pre. sidency of Louis Napoleon should be prolonged six years more, making a total of ten years. The Arch- bishop of Paris has published a pastoral letter of enormous length for the promulgation of the decree of the last Council of Paris with respect to writers on religious affairs. The archbishop complains, in strong terms, of writers in journals who have not received a religious education, and who have no delegated mis- sion to treat of the affairs of the church, attempting to establish a sort of censorship over the superior clergy, and to exercise over them an influence or control, other than that prescribed by their duties and their eonscience. The Madrid Gazette of August 29, publishes three decrees, the first authorising the minister of the in- terior to raise a loan of ten millions of reals for the acquisition of steam frigates for the packet service between Cuba and Spain. The second is for a loan to defray the expenses of the new custom house. The third decree is to raise a loan of 11 millions for the works in the harbour of the Gran of Valencia. Accounts from Copenhagen of the 28th ult. state that the Morganatic marriage of the King with the pretty milliner, whom he has created Countess Von Danner, has occasioned great consternation among the aristocracy and courtiers. The ladies who attend court, and who are highly indignant at this marriage, are under great apprehensions lest they should re- ceive a command to wait upon the Countess Von Danner. This apprehension is the greater because it is known that the lady in question has declared that nothing will give her prouder satisfaction than to see all the ladies whom she waited upon as their dressmaker now come and pay their court to her.", "word": "2", "description": "\u2026 Representatives would shortly enter upon the discussion of and pass the measures seat down from the Senate on the Californian and other questions of a similar kind.

Ledru-Rollin, Delescluze, Dupont, and Ribeyrolles, as writers in the Voix du Proscrit, com- plaining of the arrest of the conductors of that journal in France, on a pretence of a connexion with a German plot, and denying that^the Voix du Proscrit has ever had any relations with the German Committee. They pro- mise to provide in a few days for the republication of the journal. M.

Distinguished engineers have already made surveys of this important work, in which Ii> of the central departments are inter- ested.

The Paris papers of Sunday were chiefly occupied ill discussing the pretensions of the Prince de Joinville to the Presidency of the Republic. They contained no news of interest. According to a telegraphic dispatch of the 30th, the American frigate Mississippi had reached Constantinople in order to take on board the Hungarian fugitives. It is asserted that the Porte and the British Legation have agreed that Kossuth is not to be permitted to land in England. M. Jasmagyi, the Austrian interpreter and commissary, have bueu invited to be present at the liber- ation and subsequent embarkation of the Kiutayeh prisoners. ITALY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdNAPLES, SEPT. 4,- His Neapolitan Majesty very narrowly escaped death on Saturday last. The king was driving some members of the royal family in the vicipity of the Caserta railway, and was about to cross the'line, not observing a train was rapidly advancing, A countryman rushed forward and heltl the horses'heads, to the great consternation of his Majesty, who, not per- ceiving the danger, imagined a hostile intention ou the part of the man who was in fact saving his lite. AFRICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Algiers papers relate a melancholy accident which recently took place on the beach of Mus- tapha. An order had been given on the previous night by the Colonel of the 8th regiment of the line that the men should walk march the next morning to bathe. Al- though the sea during the night had become very rough, the order was not countermanded. At the roll of the drum the men went into the water, and in a few minutes a number of them were knocked uif their legs by the waves. By the exertions of such of their comrades as were expert swimmers they were all saved with the ex- ception of five, who were washed away and drowned. AMERICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLIVERPOOL, SUNDAY MORNING.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBy the Royal mail steam ship, Canada, Harrison, commander, we have received advices and letters from New York, via Halifax, to the evening of the 4th inst. She has 2:50,000 dollars in specie on freight. Great excitement still pre- vailed throughout the large cities of tllI'1 United States in reference to the Cuban invasion. Meetings have been daily held, and resolutions adopted, denouncing the pro- ceedings of the Spauiards. Several of the New Orleans rioters have been arrested and coinmiltcd lo prison. The New Orleans Picayune states that the Cuban Liberators have given the direction of allairs to General Felix Hous- ton, who takes care not lo violate the law ol the country. It is asserted that another and very formidable expedition is fitting out from various points, and that another descent willlilwrtly lie made. Another statement, published in the Washington Tel.\"jVaph, says that arrangements are in progress Itl land J,OUI) mcn shnrlly under distinguished leaders. It also says it could give details if politic to do so. Several Hungarians have left Munttrornery, Alabama, for the purpose ol joining Lopez. Letters received in New Orleans from the Cuban invaders who were taken prisoners, written a short lime previous totheir execution, ale IIlIallimonll in stating Omt Lopez had deceived them. The following passage is from one of the letters: \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Lopez, the scoundrel, has deceived us; there is no doubt that all the reports about the Cuban rising were trumped up in New Orleans,\" From Havannah we have received advices to the 23rd ult., five days laler th,m those last received. The account of tbe capture uf Lopez and IU8 followers is not conlirmed but, 00 the contrary, it is asserted that he has been sue cessful in all his engagements. We extract the following from the New York Herald under date: SAVANNAH, Sept. 1. The schooner Merchant arrived here, to-day, having left Havannah on the 23rd of August. \"We learn that General Lopez has been successful in every engagement he has had with the Spanish troops. In a battle on the 17th, General Euna, Commander-in- Chief of the Spanish army, was killed. Sever il other Spanish officers, and a large number of men. were also slain. The force of General Lopez amounted to 1,500 to 2,000 men. \"Lopez was daily receiving reinforcements, and was marching towards Havannah. General Euna was buried with much pomp iu Havannah on the 20th. There was great excitement and much apprehension in Havannah, there being only 700 troops in the c'ty.\" Accounts published in the New Orleans Picayune, in reference to the capture of Colonel Crittenden's party, state that\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Colonel Crittenden and 114 men were left at Bahia Ilonda by Lopez in charge of the baggage, while Lopez himself advanced to Lis Pozas. On the next day 700 Span- iards landed from the Pizzaro and cut off Crittenden from his companions. Colonel Crittenden made one attempt to join bis comrades, but was repulsed. The Spaniards after- wards made a charge and completely routed Crittenden's party, who spent two days & uights in the chapparell without any sustenance. Fifty of them afterwards made their way to the seathore, where they found some boats, in which they embarked. They spent the night on the ocean, and the next day they were taken prisouers by the Habanero, as de- tailed in previous reports. There are still 64 of this party missing. Forty of them are known to have been shot in a small farmhouse, and a Spanish Lieutenant reports that on the 14th he came upon 20 of them guarding an equal num- ber of their wounded comrades, all of whom were massacred. It was reported-also on Spanish authority\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat the re- maining 24 were afterwards slaushtered. The other party under Lopez, it seems, received the attack ol the Spaniards in a farmhouse at Las Pozas, and beat them off with severe loss; at least, so it is to be supposed, since the Spanish offi- cial reports state that they desisted from the assault in order to receive reinforcements. Whether any subsequent light- ing took place at this point we do not know at all events, Lopez held his own for two days-till, on the 15th, he left tor the interior, and was not molested on his match by General Enna; all of which we learn from the Spanish ac- counts. This was the state of aft'airs on the 15th. the date of our last advices from the scene of action, through Gen. Enna s despatch, dated 3.30 on that day. If General Lopez reached the mountains in safety he will discover soon whe- ther he has relied with too much confidence on the assistance of the native inhabitants.\" More recent telegraphic advices from New Orleans con- tain the following intelligence from Cuba \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd R NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 1. The brig Cincinnati has just arrived with advices from Havannah to the 25th of August. Spanish accounts state that Lopez was surrounded by 4,000 of the Government forces. Other rumours are that he is joined by large numbers, and has advanced to Mariel, only 30 miles Irom Havannah. Sept. 2. The steamer Cincinnati has arrived from Havannah with dates to the 25th ult. The accounts via Havannah are confirmed, iududing the death of General Enna, with con- siderable loss to the Spanish troops, and the advance of Lopez towards Havannah. The Cincinnati passed the Spanish war steamer Pizzaro at sea.\" CANADA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd From Canada we have nothing of impor- tance. The Canadian Parliament closed its session ou the 20th ult. We have advices from Hayti to the 16th ult., at which time every tiling was quiet. An express had ar- rived at Port au Prince on the 15lh ult., stating that the Emperor had returned to Hayti from hiM, tllUr, having crossed the Douiiniciao frontier without being molested and it was reported that the difficulty betweeu the Dowi- nician and Haytian Governments bad been amicably set- tled. Cotiee was scarce. MEXICO.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOur advices from the city of Mexico ex- tend to the 10th ult. The Legislature was to assemble on the 20th. The Senate had declared in lavour of a general confederation, similar to the Spanish South American States. A disturbance took place at Vera Cruz on the 21st, when the citizens rose to oppose the collcclion of taxes by the Government. The military were called out and several persons weie killed and wounded before the disturbance was quelled. The two vessels which recently sailed from New Orleans, under protest, for Tehuantepec, have been seized by the Mexican authorities at Coatzi- coalcos. Great distress is prevailingin Northern Mexico. The crops have failed, and the stock is perishing for want of water and pasture. The Indians are ravaging the country. The Browusville (Texas) papers say that the Mexican Government are prosecutiug Reveral senators, and that some have been fined and others imprisoned. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdTexas accounts of the 27th ult. state that the Indians have perpetrated more depredations and committed several murders. They had also broken into and robbed the Point Isabel Custom-house of 10,000 dollars. NEW YORK, SEPT. 4. P.M. Semi-official accounts received from Washington stale that the Government possess information that on the 25th of August Lopez had been able to maintain himself, but with a very reduced force; not one Creole had joined him; his prospects were desperate. It is a personal struggle for his own and the lives of his few remaining followers. No reinforcements have gone from New Orleans, and the Government is successfully exerting itself to prevent any. The collector of Customs at New Orleans has been re- moved from office for alleged indifference in Cuban matters. California accounts to the first of August arrived here today. Mining statements contiuue favourable; business is reported better. The steamer Oregon, from San Fran- cisco to Panama, has upwards of 2,000,000 dollars in dust on board. Slock market to-day very dull. Steamer America's news was received here yesterday; its effect has been to advauce cotton about a quarter ol a cent. In Hour and grain no change of consequence. AMERICAN AFFAIRS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdNEW YORK, SEPT. 2\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThere is no further news from Cuba, except such as comes from Savan- nah and new Orleans by telegraph. These accounts are so essentially contradictory that while some of them proclaim startling successes on the side of the marauding party, others declare positively that a second batch of prisoners, consist- ing of 205, had been captured and soon after shot. These ducrepancicsareso great, and the motives for exaggeration or absolute falsehood so strong, that until the airival of a regular mail such statements will be classified, tike many other manufactured stories, under the head of important if true.

Another terrible conflagration has taken place in San Francisco, destroying a number of public build- ings, several whole streets of private dwellings, many of the ships at the wharfs, and a large amount of other property, taking a total loss of 15,000,000 dolls. It is feared that a humber of lives have been lost.

{"ocr": "I FOREIGN INTKLLIGK.XCE. I After the political excitements which, under different forms, have, during the last two months, agitated the leading powers in the world, we have slink into a state of collapse, just as unsettled and undecided as ever, but too tired to begin the conflict again till we have gained breath. Perhaps in the annals of no ferment so general as the agitation of the Dresden congress in Germany, of t;ie Parliamentary cabal in France, and of the Ministerial crisis iu England, has subsided with so little effect for the present.and with so much mischief to the future. The Government of either country stands to all outward appearance much as it stood before the ferment, but a general doubt and disquietude exists on all sides, and prevents the development of the reforms and improvements about which the worrel had been so sanguine hitherto. At this moment, in all the pro- gressing states of Europe, the governments are more ready than is their wont to give their aid to the advance- ment of society, but (lie complexities around them cool what zeal they have acquired, and disappoint, the eager wishes of the many who haif a year ago were so full of expectation. In France\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdmatters are left to themselves. Trade flourishes or is depressed\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdsociety is criminal or quiet- the country advances or retrogrades \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdall from the acci- (lent [If the hour. Neither t.h\" legislature nor the au- thoritie lend their assistance either one way or the other \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe one pass no b,*I!s-tlie other promulgate no mea- sures which can influence society in any way. Small matters about the National Guard or the duties of offi- cials occupy their attention, and the nation gets on as it best may. While the real interest of France is fixed our future intrigues, while the partisans of Bonapartisni, Orleanism, Absolutism, Republicanism, are all roaming the country with equal chance, claiming the assistance of their citizens, and distracting the feelings of the popu- lation what hl)po2 is there of anyrhinQ: beyond chance quiet and chanc amelioration ? The wliole thing is one perpetual campaign, in which the lull of preparation, the ingenuity of the skirmish, and the excitement of battle follow in dtic -succession. The nation is always either in expectation or action, and might as well he constantly fighting, for any advantage they get from the respite, as constantly under arms with the intention of fighting. The utter absence of important occurrences in France, excepting when a collision takes place between the rival parties, is one of the worst features of its position. Germany is languidly fighting\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdbut so languidly that one can see the blows. Austria and Prussia are still agreed on the formation of a new central executive power principle is easy enough, but neither will consent to details which wid give any advantage to its rival. In consequence, the meetings are suspended, and the King of Prussia, who cannot quite see the actual cause of his loss of pn,jtinn durin:; the last year, has (li\"1 ;\\ectl his Minister at the Dresden Congress \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd IVaron M mteuffel. The Baron's tame resistance to the de- mands of .Austria-first, to swamp Germany with her Italian, Hungarian, and Polish states, and next to assume the almost uncontro\\1erl presidency of the pro- posed Diet\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhas irritaterl the mind of the most vacillating of mon irclis, and at this moment King Frederick William feels almost as valiant as Mr. Robert Acres. The extent to which his resistance will go, our previous ideas of the monarch do not lead us to estimate very highly. But, in truth, Germanic preponderance, mainly depending on influence and the circumstances of the moment, is always vacillating by its oivn weight; and after all, it amounts to little enough. Tile minor monarchs, of no definite views or pretensions, are never the same half a year together, and their uncertainties, as those of the Germanic electors of old, prevent the establishment flf any fixed preponderance. So far, although tll\"Y I11P:ln nothing but their own selfishness, they deserve well of their country. Prussia may wait for \"the turn of the next chance, which this time twelve- month may place her end of the see-saw uppermost. Much good may her exaltation do her, when she gets it. ITALY. I It is stated that his Holiness having applied for a reinforcement to the King of Naples, the Litter has declined, on the ground that such a course would be contrary to the conditions agreed on between the four Powers. King; Ferdinand, however, has ponseuted to concentrate his troops on the frontier so as to assist the Pope in case of need. TURKEY. The mail from Constantinople has brought important news from Bagdad. It is well known that the great. Arab tribe of the Annezeh migrate yearly, following the course of the Euphrates, from the neighbourhood of Aleppo to that of Bagdad, where they arrive about Christmas, and sell camels and horses, and buv dates. It has long been the custom of the Pashas of Bagdad to pay black mail to the powerful sheiks of this tribe and the Shammar, when their vast encampments move down into the neigh- bourhood of the old capital of the caliphs, in order to keep the roads open, and protect pilgrims and travellers from the depredations of the Bedouins. \"It seems how- ever, that Abdi Pasha, who has recently succeeded to I, the p'ishalik, refused th Ilsual purses of tomauns de- manded of hi in by the Annezeh sheikhs. I hereupon a I cloud of mounted with tiluil- wer\" seen in the horizon on the right, bank of tiie Tigris. The fellahs fled, wiiooping, with their flocks towards the city- walls, while their women raised the shrill alarm of their thrilling Lu-lu-lu.\" Abdi Pasha marched out with his troops to meet the enemy hut, although they had Cilnuon with thcm, they could not stand the charge of the Annezeh, and they were beaten back into Bagdad, after suffering considerable In,s, ,111\u00c3\ufffd leaving one gun Oil the field. The Annezeh were encamped iu the imme- diate neighbourhood of the city, which they besieged, and contmuedtheir depredations to the right and ieft over the whole country, plundering t:w villages and dri- ?n?o?' cattle. Meanwhile three of the sheikhs had been to the Serai to par)eywi'h the j'?sha. One of' these having suddenly died, it is expected that he must i hac been poison cd with the coffee or sherbet, which is usually offered as a compliment in the East on all visits, j The Arabs had been irritated to a great pitch of fury at this presumed treachery. It is stated that the Austrian Cabinet has addressed an energetic note to the Porte, demanding a definite tranquillisation of Bosnia and of the llevzegowiua, and protestin against the establishment of a fre^ port at Scutari, which the Austrian Cabinet considers as a demonstration against the porte of Trieste. INDIAN NEWS. The last intelligence received from India announces that the fort of Dharoor, in the Nizam's dominions, has surrendered to Brigadier Beatson. It is said tfiat a nor- j tion of the Nizam's dominions is to be ceded to the- Bri- tish, in payment of the ment. The visit of the Governor-General to Peshawur is expected to have a bencficial inlfuence on the settle- ment of the frontier question. The Iiaree Doab canal, the Punjaub territory, is in process of construction when completed, it, is expected that it will wafer an area of half a million of acres, now barren, and afford sustenance and employment to up- wards of two millions of people. The Governor-General is taking measures to prorirle the Punjaub with a more extensive and better svstem of education. A robbery of nearly i:10,000 has bpcn committed on the Oriental Bank. The citizens of New Mexico are petitioning Congress for protection against the numerous tribes of wild In- dians surrounding the territory. From all accounts the condition of that section of the country is truly de- plorable. From the rapid destruction of game in the nrairies, the necessities of the wandering Indians have driven them to levy their subsistence upon emi- grants and passing caravans and the most convenient white settlements; and it so happens, from the location and character of the country, that the white settlements of the valley of the Rio Urallcle arc completely environed by these half-starved savages. From the desolate plains to the east and the north the Camanches descend upon the flocks of the poor pueblos, and cai-ry them offbv thousands. 1\" rum the wild hills to the southward, on the.

The accounts from Madrid relate chieflv to the ejec- tions, which appear to be in favour of the b\u00c3\ufffdtry. The Queen-Mother has sustained a painful accident. In getting out of her carriage at Aranjuez, her foot slipped, and she broke her leg. No danger is appre- hended. The Queen is undoubtedly pregnant. Advices of the 3rd of May, give the following list of the new Portuguese Ministry President of the Coun- cil, aldanha; Interior, Passoz Finances, Francini; Justice, Ferrao; Foreign Affairs, Count Labradio; Marine, Viscount de Sa. A certain degree of agita- tion prevailed in the capital on f the morning of that day, but, up to the departure of the mail, no move- ment had broken out. The opposition journal s s pokt in very clear terms of the probability and even neces- sity of the abdication of the Queen in favour of her eldest son, aged 14. Bylaw, he only attains his ma- jority at IS, but as the Queen herself ascended the throne at 14, it was not considered that his youth would be an objection. The steam-packet Hellespont, arrived on Fridav at Plymouth. She left the Cape at noon on April 4, Sierra Leone the 20th, and Cape \u00c2\u00a1J\" Verde Oil the 2oth. Sir Harry Smith, with about 2,200 troops of all sorts, was at King William's Town. Having been apprised of the intention of the Kaffirs to assault Fort Hare, with the intention of rescuing the Hottentot prisoners, he anticipated their attack by moving against them. Upwards of Ion were killed, many wounded, and a number of cattle captured. On the part of the British forces only a few rank and file were killed and wounded. Colonel Mackinnon's patrol from King William's Town had made a raid on the Kaffirs, de- stroyed several of their kraals, and by the aid of the Fingoes taken a quantity of tock. In consequence of forty-six armed Cape Mounted Rifles having connected themselves with the disatfec.ed Hottentots at Blink- water, about one-half of that body have been dis- arm, d, and 200 of their horses are now appropriate to the use of the levies from the western Three or four of the deserters from the Hirlc p have been shot. Accounts have been received from Lisbon lotii. The King had resigned the command el .1 army, but he was so unpopular that neither Donna Maria eould venture to appear in public, ,1 an attack on the Palace by the people it-as considered probable. Saldanha was expected to enter Lisbon on the l.'ith, at the head of a large force. Senor Jose Passos, a Septembrista, had been chosen President of the Military Council. The latest accounts irom Bosnia are of the 2th ult. On that day Skanderbcg summoned the insur- gents who were \"in possesion of the fort of Krukdo to surrender on condition of an amnesty. This pro- posal having heen accepted, the lurks occupied the fort at seven ,).1\"1.. p.m. The chiefs of the insur- rection have crossed the Austrian frontier at Jabeicc, and Karlstadt has been assigned to them as a resi- \u00c3\ufffdencp.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY. The Steam-ship America, which reached Liverpool on itoiida)-, brought letters and papers from New York to tlw -tth, and accounts, by electric telegraph via Halifax, to the 2(?t)? ult. inclusive. She passed the Europa cn- tering Boston, on the 21st, The Arctic arrived at N?,? York on the 22d. Letters from Washington, in the New York journals, reiterate the rumoured intention of the I\". S. Cabinet to propose to England a Protectorate for the small states of Central America; Greytown to be a free port and the San Juan a free river. It is also stated that a federal Government had been agreed upon between the States Nicaragua, San Salvador and Honduras, and that they had been seeking to establish relations with the Washington Government, and that orders had been issued by the Secretary of the Treasury permitting Canadian vessels to load and unload at ports in the United States so long as similar privileges are extended to American vessels in Canadian ports. No foreign vessels are how- ever, to be permitted to engage in the American coasting trade. On the :2:\u00c2\u00a1d a mutiny broke out on board the packet-ship New World, on the eve of her departure for Liverpool; four mutineers were arrested. From St. Louis we learn that, .1,000 deaths from cholera had occurred amongst the Sioux Indians. The Liverpool and Phila- dclphia steam- ship City of Pittsburg was launched, on the 21st ult., at Williamsburg. Letters from the City of Mexico, of the 5th ultimo, an- nounce, that the President of the Republic of Mexico having called an extra session of Congress, the two Houses met on the 2!)th May, in a preparatory sitting, to organize their different committees and appoint their offices. Senor Lacunza was chosen President of the Senate, and Senor Alcorta President of the Lower House. On the 2d the Congress commenced its session of business, but the House of Deputies had no quorum and was obliged to adjourn. The Senate had a quorum, and occupied itself on some measures, principally on public credit. The dis- cussion on these propositions was not terminated. The 1'rt',ident's address to the Congress on the opening of its sittings was brief and unimportant. Our accounts are as usual, replete with reports of robberies, murders, revolts k, c. Senor Yancz had resigned the Treasury Depart- ment and resumed the charge of Foreign Affairs. The steamer with the West India and Mexican mails has arrived, and the accounts she brings from our colonial possessions are, in respect to the weather, tolerably satis- factory. The cholera, however, still prevailed in parts of Jamaica. The wet weather was one cause of this since experienced planters had declared that for many vears past the island has not been favoured with such favour- able season as the last few weeks were the harbingers of. All united, however, in regretting the scarcity of labour. The ship Brandon had arrived at Port Royal with 200 Africans from the depot at Sierra Leone, bavin\"- been captured from a French slaver. They are described as being young and healthy. More were expected, and the colony would readily absorb twenty thousand such. The term of contraet was for one year only. Many of the Coolies, having served their five years, were applying for their return passage to India, and no doubt, would induce others to come to the colonies. The Sugar and Rum crops of the present year have realised in Jamaica the expecta- tions formed while they were yet in the ground. Ship. ping to the mother country was in great demand, the vessels in port being totally inadcquate for the produce made. Unless fre5h bottoms arrived, a large proportion of the crop would inevitably lie over. The assembly of Trinidad has passed an ordinance for encouraging immi- gration from the United States of America and the British North American provinces of labourers of African descent. The Sugar crop of Barbadoes is estimated at 30,000 hogs- heads. In Demerara the determination of the London directors of the railway, not to to construct it at present beyond the village of Victoria, had caused great dissatis- faction. The company pleads want of means at present. The Court of Policy had passed a resolution calling upon the local board not to abdicate their functions, nor consent to the appropriation of such part of the loan as may still remain unexpended to any other object than that of de- fraying the cost of construction cf the line of railway between the village ofvictoria and the village of Mahaica. Retrenchment was being perscveringly carried out in Demerara. The advices from Guatemala appear to be more encour- aging. Peace with San Salvador and Honduras was likely to be permanently secured, and public works were rapidly progressing. Particular attention was paid to the roads. The reports from the gold mines of Buenaventura, about forty miles from Panama, are very encouraging. About 350 persons were working them, and the average yield is said to be two to three ounces per diem, but provisions were so enormously high as to outweigh nearly all the advantages. The Senate of Hamburgh had remonstrated with the Cabinet of Vienna against the occupation of that city by Austrian troops. Prince De Schwartzenburg has replied that his Government had only to consider the interests of the defence of the territory and of order, and that those interests called for the maintenance of that occupation. Letters from Hamburg, of the 8th instant, announce that the Danish Ministry had resigned, and that the capital of Denmark was in a state of great agitation. A decree of the Government of Hesse Cassel of the 2d declares that public functionaries shall be relieved of all responsibility for their acts done by orders of their superiors. The Duke of Augustenburg, who was compromised in the in- surrection of Schleswig-Holstein, has just left the Duchies with his family to reside in a town in Southern Germany. The Zollverein is about to propose to Belgium a commer- cial treaty on a new basis. The free-traders demand that the privileges at present enjoyed by Belgian iron shall be extended to that of other countries. The Duchess of Leuchtenberg arrived at Berlin on the 2d. The King of Saxony is about to make a visit to Italy, passing through Austria and Bohemia on his way there. His Majesty, it is known, is a distinguished botanist, and his journey is to be entirely occupied in botanical researches. An imper- ial ordinance has been published, fixing the 11th of August next as the period when Venice shall be opened as a free port. Accounts from Athens of the 24th ult., received via. Trieste, state that the Greek Senate had unanimously adoptedavoteofcensureon the Ministry. The unanimity of the vote caused surprise, as only a few days before ten new senators had been created. In consequence of remonstrances on the part of the Pontifical Government, the Republic of San Marino has expelled 33 political refugees; and delivered up a number of common criminals who had sought an asylum on that territory since the 17th of May last, the court-martial of the Eastern Lombardo-Venetian districts has pronounced 212 condemnations including 115 sentences of death. In 18411 there were 2,514 sentences pronounced by courts- martial at Padua and Itovigo in 1850 the number sank to 1,329. There have been 223 in the first quarter of the present year. On the 21st ult. the Austrian arms were hoisted with great ceremony and military display over the gate of the Austrian Consulate at Ferrara, as a reparation for the insults, offered to them by the people of that town on 2d November, 1848. The Uosphoious steamer arrived at Plymouth, on Monday, with later news from the Cape. Sir Harry Smith continued with the head quarters at King William's Town.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY. The American advices to the 9th from New York, and the 11th from Halifax, brought by the Niagara steamer, which arrived at Liverpool on Saturday, in- clude the important announcement that President Taylor had been attacked, shortly after the departure of our last accounts by the Pacific, with a fit of cho- lera, and, although prompt medical assistance was obtained, the gallant old soldier gradually sank, and at length died. Vice President Phillimore, a gentle- man, whose name was scarcely known in Europe, succeeds to the vacant presidency, as did President Tyler on the death of General Harrison. A new Cabinet must now also be formed, and one point of interest will be the result of the new state of affairs on the slavery question. Various names are men- tioned as likely to be called to office, but of course alii is idle speculation. It generally is conceded that few, if any, of the late President's Cabinet will hold office under the altered state of affairs. Mr. Webster is confidently named for a state secretaryship. The new President had been sworn. Much anxiety existed in relation to the disputed question of territory between New Mexico and Texas. Troops were being marched to the spot by Texas, and New Mexico had organized a constitution. The docu- ment had arrived at the capital, and the States' sena- tors were shortly expected. President Taylor's death may also exercise an important negative influence upon the course of events in this quarter. The British Government had made a communica- tion to the United States Government in reference to the wreck of the steamer Missouri, which was sunk while burning in the harbour of Gibraltar. The wreck endangered navigation. The subject was before the Committee on Naval Affairs in the Senate. Dr. Webster still continued imprisoned as a convict under sentence of death. His wife and daughters had interceded for him personally. Multitudinous, petitions for commutation had been presented to the authorities, and hopes of at least preserving his life were enter- tained. Several collisions of a serious character had occurred between the United States troops and the Indian aborigines of the Sacramento Valley. The losses were chiefly on the side of the Indians, who soon after sent a deputation of chiefs to procure a treaty of peace, a result which had been attained in a perfectly satisfac- tory manner. At Clear Lake a large body of Indians had been killed by a detachment of the United States troops from the garrisons of Sonora and Benicia, Much difficulty had arisen from the collection of the mining-tax on foreigners of X4 per month. The tax was protested against as exorbitant and unjust, and the citizens generally sympathized with the discontent of the foreigners. Some violent demonstrations had taken place at Sonora. The ship Albion, of London, chartered by Her Majesty's Government for procuring timber for the navy, had been seized at Oregon by General Dorr, on the part of the United States Gov- ernment. for smuggling and cutting timber in the ernment. for smtig ?,p i t? d ,States. Gold ,n T g. Id dust possession of the United States. Gold and gold dust continued to pour into New York and New Orleans from California. The accounts from the Havannah are to the 6th current, eight days later than by the West India steamer Thames. Commodore M'Keever had held an interview with the Captain-General, and was extremely satisfied with the result, the Count Yicoy giving every assurance that the prisoners would soon be liberated and harmony restored. The prisoners were at present under the control of Admiral Armero, who would give no information in regard to them, and differed entirely in his views from the Captain-General. An investigation had taken place, and the Captain-General was of opinion that many of the passengers were entirely innocent of any intention of disembarking 011 the island of Cuba, but were under the impression that they were bound to Chagres. Admiral Armero was in 7 uavour of the harshest measures, and, it is said, had treated the prisoners with great cruelty. A report was circulated previous to the sailing or tne ueorgia that nine of them had died of ill-treatment. Great excitement prevailed against Americans generally- more so since the news of the burning of the steamer Guadalquivir arrived in Havannah. It was generally considered to have been done on purpose, as an act of retaliation. There was also a great excitement against the American Consul, Mr. Campbell, on account of some letters he had written to the United States' State Department, reflecting, in the opinion of the Spaniards, on their navy and militia. The Consul was obliged to keep his house fortified, and ready at any moment to repel an attack. He had been threatened with assa- sination in anonymous letters, and did not consider his life, and that of his family, safe. The consul takes the ground that the capture of the two vessels was an illegal act, in which he was supported by all the Ame- ricans in Havannah. The Spaniards were assembling a large naval force at Havannah. Three frigates and two brigs had just arrived from Spain to join the squadron of Admiral Armero. The Catalan party, at the head of which is Admiral Armero, was strongly in favour of war; in the meantime, the volunteers were drilling daily, and amounted to 5,000 men. We have files of Jamaica papers to the 1st inst.- The Legislature assembled in extraordinary session to remedy a defect in a loan bill passed last session, to raise \u00c2\u00a3240,000 to efface the debt of the island. The late bill limited the amount of interest to be paid, at which it could not be procured; the assembling of the Legislature, therefore, was to afford an opportunity, of which it readily availed itself, of authorizing the com- missioners in England to increase the amount of in- terest on the required sum. On the 1st inst. the As- sembly would be prorogued to the 1st of October.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Fine rains had fallen, and the weather was favourable. Information has been transmitted from Hamburgh to the French Government, announcing the arrest and imprisonment in that city of a Pole, on a charge of a plot for the assassination of the King of Prussia. The I person in question had only a very short time before arrived from London, where, it is believed, the plan was concocted in one of the numerous secret political societies for some time past established there. The proceedings and movements of the man in custody had for some weeks previous been carefully watched by the Prussian Authorities in London, in consequence of intimation received of a plot that had been formed, of which his Prnssian Majesty was the object. When the Pole was seized, no papers of any kind, at least not of a kind to thi ow an), lig-ht on the terrible mission on which he was sent, were found on him. His lodg- ing was also visited by the police, but nothing was found to incriminate him. It was known, however, that his mother was residing in Hamburg, and police agents proceeded there to search the house. They found the old woman in bed, dying she was even in the last agonv, and when the officers entered, was found with her hand clenched holding a fragment of paper, while the ashes of other papers were found scattered on the floor, or in the ifre-ploce, as if onlv a few minutes before committed to the flames, The fragment of paper found in the desperate grasp of the dying woman was blank. At the (late of the last ac- counts it was not stated that any documents were dis- covered. A sergeant of artillery of one of the forts of Lyons was shot dead by a corporal, while in the act of instruct- ing the men in the exercise of the guns. The ball passed through his heart, and wounded i -i-eiii,dier who was standing at some distance. The corporal had been punished a short time before for some breach of discipline. Xineteen houses were destroyed by fire on the 18th instant in the commune of Tremblay Le N'icirente, Eure et Loire; and six houses, with the whole of the crops and eleven cows, the same day, in the village of Chantaloup were also destroyed. There is little doubt of this destruction being the work of incendiaries. A dreadful fire broke out on the 18th at Cracow, which laid waste a great part of the city, and consumed the Archbishop's Palace, besides other public build- ings. War between Denmark and the Duchies has broken out afresh, instantly upon the announcement of the peace between Denmark and Germany, and at the very moment when the principles which ought to terminate this unnatural contest had received the sanction of the great Powers in the London conference, the dispute is brought on the frontiers of Denmark to the arbitration of the sword. The troops of the Duchies occupied Eckenforde on the night of the 13th instant. lurf boats from Keil, concealing under their cargo heavy guns for the defence of that place, passed the Danish vessels without challenge, and the dawn of the 14th saw them mounted- General Willisen, commander-in- chief of the army of the Duchies, entered the city of Schleswig with his staff on the 13th. The rest of the troops crossed the Eyder the following day, except the garrison of Rendsburg, which is provisioned for six months. The Statthalterschaft, or Provisional Go- vernment of the Duchies, has issued a proclamation, dated Keil, July 15, announcing that the convention, which bound them, determined July 10, in consequence of the treaty of peace of July 2, between Denmark and Prussia, and ordering all official, civil, military, and I spiritual, and the whole population of Schleswig, to obey the orders issued by the Shatthalterschaft, and not those of the Danes, until the conclusion of peace with Denmark. Accounts from Hamburgh of the 19th instant, state that a Danish naval force had landed 150 men on the island of Fehmern, and taken possession of it. On the evening of the 17th a corps of 2000 Danes entered Flensborg, and a skirmish took place next morning between the outposts. A serious colli- sion between the armies is daily expected. The Circassians, under Shamil Bey have crossed the frontier, and, near Eskidevirche, surprised and defeated the Russians, who lost a general, an aide-de-camp, seventy officers, four guns, and most of their ammuni- tion and baggage.", "word": "1", "description": "\u2026 as likely to be called to office, but of course alii is idle speculation.

{"ocr": "MARSHAL SALDANHA. [From the Atlas.] Portuguese politics are alike the Portuguese ports-of ex- ceedingly difficult navigation; closed by bars, beset with quicksands, swept by rapid currents, nowhere is there a greater difficulty of getting to safe anchorage. General Saldanha seems to have steered his barque with much skill. It is evident that when he lifted up the standard of resistance against Thomar, he was alone, and of nobody's party. He was not radical enough for the Septembrists, whilst he was too Septembrist for the army. His cruelty to the captives of Torres Vedras had lost him the support of the citizens and notwithstanding, though no one loved Saldanha, all stood so much in need of a revolution, that almost all of those hostile or indifferent to him helped him to make one. Saldanha placed himself at the heard of this movement, and all who were previously so discontented with him, gave signs of satisfaction. Instead of endangering the Queen's throne, it is now admitted that her Majesty is in a safer position than she was with Thomar. The army, which had been so carefully weeded of Liberals, without acquiring any increased.or over-stedfast loyalty, is in the way of being ren- dered more national by the re-admission of its due proportion of liberal officers. Provincial and other posts of authority are distributed equally between parties, instead of being, as in Thomar's time, a mere monopoly of Cabral dependants. The great task of Saldanha himself is the preparation of such an electoral law as will provide a fair representative assembly, possessed of the confidence and commanding the respect of the nation. The true progress, indeed, making by both Spain and Portugal, lies in this change, this substi- tution of free elections for Cortes packed under official and military intimidation. In Portugal, as in Spain, Progresistas are allowed full liberty of action instead of being compelled either to wield power themselves with a rigid hand, or run into exile to avoid imprisonment and worse. K This great improvement, which had already been felt at Madrid, without revolution or emeute, has fortunately been introduced into Portugal successfully, though by the objectionable means of a military pronunciamento. When governments, however, will trust to the sword, they must expect to be reformed by it. The best consequence of the present emeute is the diminution of military influence, and the bringing into action other influences to counterbalance it. As long as the court alone upheld the Ministry, packed the Cortes, and used the army as a body-guard, so long it was at the mercy of that army. Whereas, the Queen sup- ported by a Cortes of mixed parties is neither at the mercy of any of those parties nor of a general officer. If Queens Isabella and Christina have learnt this, surely it is time that Donna Maria, blessed with so many constitutional relations and advisers, should consent to appreciate and adopt such political truths. It should be remarked that the great cause of Spain's having made this quiet progress, without turbulence or revo- lution, has been the circumstance of foreign powers ceasing to exercise direct influence over the cabinet and court of Madrid. The overthrow of the royal family and throne of France quite liberated Spain of that dependence, which for many years had driven the Queen's Government into a course of tyranny and reaction. Narvaez, indeed, is a relation by marriage of the Napoleon family, and kept up that connexion. But it had not much influence on politics; the complete ces- satlOI of either English, French, or Austrian influence at itadrid, was, perhaps, the happiest circumstance that could have befallen Spain. It certainly has resulted in great con- stitutional improvement, and in a free Cortes. We are glad to learn that Lord Palmerston resisted all attempts to mduce him to admit that Saldanha's triumph over the court was casus foederis, foreseen by treaties, and warranting the succour of Portugal by a Spanish army. The Marquis of Miraflores was very anxious to be allowed to undertake a crusade, and the French Minister backed his pretensions strenuously. Fortunately the folly was resisted, or the politics of the peninsula would at present have been in as intricate, and absurd and a hopeless state as those of France itself. There are some, indeed, who insist that the present is but a lull, which can only last until the meeting of the Constitu- tional Cortes, in which they say the Septembrists will pre- vail. Saldanha has acted fairly by inviting the eminent men and nobles of the old aristocratic and absolutist party to join, and counterbance revolutionary tendency. But, unfor- tunately, the ultra Loyalists, as in France, are as often found voting with the ultra Republicans, as with practical and moderate men. Portugal has a main sheet to keep her steady. This is the certainty, that the Spanish Government will interfere, if the Portuguese give them the pretext by any extravagance, and that England will help them against Spain only in proportion to their moderation. CALIFORNIA. I The last advices are triply startling -first, because of the immense findings of gold, 350,000 dollars of which had been (so it is said) blown out of some rocks at one blast; secondly, the prevalence ofLynch law, five Mexicans having been hang- ed by its sudden and fatal decree at San Joachim, and one man hanged on suspicion, though afterwards shown to be innocent, at Monkelumne and, thirdly, the lustot conquest spreading. An expedition was forming for the conquest of Lower Cali- foriiia another is said to be on the tapis for the capture of Sonora and it certainly seems not in the power of the United States Government to prevent the assembling on the plains of adventurers for these illegal purposes. It seems probable that these two provinces will at no distant day be separated from Mexico. a", "word": "976", "description": "\u2026 capture of Sonora and it certainly seems not in the power of the United States Government to prevent the assembling on the plains of adventurers for these illegal purposes.

{"ocr": "I TRADE AND ITS PROSPECTS. The condition of the money market is very satisfac- tory, and there is no symptom of an extended demand for accommodation. The Bank of England has not in- creased its circulation, nor is it likely to do so, for the present, as the payments into the national excheqner are steadily progressing, and will continue until the end of the present quarter. This always throws back a certain amount of notes, and sometimes of bullion, upon the bank, and must, so far, not he taken exactly as a criterion of the discount market. The steamers from the West Indies, and from the United Slates are still bringing over specie, and the exchtinges generally are more favourable. According to the harvest reports, the prospects of a full yield are encouraging, and the statements from the Con- tinent are satisfactory on the same head. In business walks there is a fair share of activity. The home trade is healthy, and for certain foreign markets, the demand is good. The United States have taken a good quantity of textile fabrics for the\" fall,\" and as the receipts of gold from California continue large, they will be no doubt able to pass the supplies profitably into consumption. The later advices from India are more encouraging.

The American papers, which arrived on Monday, givo details of the loss of the steamer Rhode Island in the Gulf of Mexico, on the 29th of January.- She sailad from Now York on Friday the 23d of January, for California, She stopped two days at quarantise, and went to sea on the 25th, laden with coal and provisions forty- four persons on board in all. Slit was loaded down almost to her guards,- It was predicted by all who saw her leave the wharf, that she could not get out safely. A passenger gives the following account of the casualty. We get alonit very well during the first two days, going eight or nine miles an hour, with a smooth sea. The wind began to blow fresh on Sunday.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd About noon there was some sea on, and she labour- ed heavily. We commenced throwing coal over- board, and got rid of all the loose coal on deck, and all that was in bags-about 1110 tons. Sunday night and Monday was again calm, and slio went along very well. On Monday afternoon it got to be cloudy and threatening, and several of tho hands went to the captain and asked to be put on board a ship that was in sight astern, or else to run down and lay by during the night. He refused, and said there was no danger. Soon after this the wind commenced blowing heavily ulltil midnight, when it blew a gale. The wheel ropes got foul se- veral times. About one a.m. on l'oosday, the 29th, the wheel ropes broke. The man at the wheel was knocked down, and seriously injured by one of the spokes. The steamer then broached to; n heavy sea struck her, and she broke in two, falling both at the sterri and bows, and iflled rapidly. The engine was put to work to pump her out, which kept her some. what clear, until it stopped, from the machinery get. ting displaced. The steam WM then blown off, nnd the boats got ready for launching. One of them had been kept ready for several hours, and was provisioned. -The sailors generally slept in her when off duty, as they apprehended some accident. At about half-past one o'clock, the cooks and some of the passengers, without the knowledge of the captain, launched one of the jolly boat, which swung round immedistely under the guards, and was swamped. No person was in it. When nearly two o'clock, the captain called all hands, and appointed thirty to go in the long boat, and the rest in the se- cond jolly boat. Two men were sent in the long boat to keep her clear, and she was launched safely. -She was then hauled round to the bows, and ten more taken in- n ine 10011 and one female passen- get. before others could be got down, she was struck br the stern of the steamer and badly stove; those in the boat then cut her adrift, and pulled to the windward. After bailing her our, they tried to get to the steamer again to take more, but the sea ran so high they could not reach her. The boat was much encumbered with clothing and other things, which the second mate, Benjamin Boyd, who had taken command of her, ordered to be thrown overboard. She was thus relieved of everything except half-a-dozen hams, one cheese, three gallons of water, two qnadrants, and a com- pass. All this was about two o'clock on the mllln. ing of the 29th, The boat was kcpt running be- fore the sea, and they bailed incessantly during the night. At day-light a schooner was seen about three miles distant, laying to they immediately pulled up for her, but were not seen until almost alongside. All hands, together with the boat, were taken on board the schooner, which proved to be the Mary Ann, Captain Crockett, from New York, bound for Porto Rico. After being on board the schooner two days they fell in with and spoke the whale sbip Richmond, Captain Swift, of Pro- vidence, homeward bound. Although scarce of water, Captain Swift took all the company from the schooner, and after treating them in the kind- est manner, landed them safely at Providence on Monday morning, where they received every at- tention from the officers and owners of the Rich- mond, who sent them to Fall River, from which place they came to the city on Tuesday morning.", "word": "758", "description": "\u2026I WRECK OF A STEAMER AND LOSS OF THIRTY-TWO LIVES.

A covenant of perpetual peace and amity has been made between several of the Indian tribes in the Iowa region and the United States government. Governor Ramsey has succeeded in making a most favourable treaty with the Chippeways at Pembina. A riot took place at San Juiti, on board the steamship Prometheus, in consequence of the captain's refusing to leave until the passengers by the Independence had arrived.

The tea duty question between the Governor, Sir George Bonham, and Sen, the Chinese Viceroy, re- mains in statu quo, and the probability is, will continue so. Paper protocols will effect little with the Chinese until they are made to understand their importance. The Custom-house authorities at Shanghai have adopted more stringent measures against smuggling. For the first time the Chinese there have displayed some hostile feeling against foreigners, occasioned by a misunderstanding con- nected with a piece of ground required for a place of re- creation.

The Duke of Saldanha entered on the 27th, and received a hearty welcome. As soon as this news reached Lisbon, Count de Thomar's ministry immediately resigned, and the count took his depar- ture for Vigo, where he is now located. The Duke of Terceira has been named president of a new ministry. The insurrectionary movement in favour of Saldanha is rapidlv spreading.

{"ocr": "COLLISION AT SEA.-SEVEN LIVES LOST. The steamer Minerva, which was lately placed on tne Irish line between Kingstown and Liverpool, in opposi- tion to the City of Dublin Company's vessels, put into Beaumaris on Tuesday morning, having had the mis- fortune to come into collision with an inward bound brig, the William Rushton, by which the latter sunk, the former sustained great damage, and seven lives were un- fortuately lost. On Monday evening, the Minerva, with 150 passengers on board, left Liverpool, at seven o'clock, in company with the Iron Duke, both vesels being bound for Kings- ?,wn. During the whole of the evening it blew very hard from W.S.W., and the Minerva, not being able to make much way outside, kept on the Welsli coast. A few minutes after twelve o'clock, when the Minerva was between Puffin Island and Point Lynas, about four miles out, a strange sail was descried bearing close upon the steamer. The vessel proved to be the William Rushton, from Laguna, on the coast of Mexico, heavily laden with mahogany and a few parcels of general e Irgo. It is said that the brig was not observed by the steamer until she was close upon her, the former showing 110 light, but that the people on the brig saw the steamer's lights some ten minutes before the frightful collision which eventu- ally occurred. Immediately on the brig being seen coming in the direction of the steamer, it was clear to all on board that a collision was inevitable, and, conse- quently, the engines were at once reversed, aud the hi lni put hard up, and everytlJirg done to mitigate the effects of a calamity which seemed unavoidable. Only a few moments elapsed after the brig was first seen before the bowsprit of the steamer came in contact with her, striking her about midships, and the collision was a violent one, froir the circumstance that the steamer was going at full speed when she first saw the brig, and the engineer had therefore not time to reverse the engines in time to pt event serious consequences. As son as Capt. Ilall, of the Minerva, saw what had happened, and that it was evident that the brig would sink, he promptly ordered out the life-boat of the Minerva, and although he was remonstrated with by many of the passengers for doing so, on the ground that such a step was rash and useless in consequence of the sea running so high at the time, he still persisted in sending the boat off, whieh succeeded in saving the lives sending the boat oQ, whi.?h succeeded in saving the hves t' e cook, and two seamen. The remainder of the crew, altogether numbered eleven, were all drowned. In about ten minutes after the collision the brig sunk in deep water not a vestige of her was to be seen. The life-boat belonging to the steamer had the utmost difficulty in regaining the Minerva, as the sea was run- ning so very high at the time. On examining the Minerva, Capt. Hall found that her fore compartment was so stove in by the collision as to be completely filled with water, and the ship was considerably down by the head. He also found that she had lost her boWipl i', her foremast, and all her running forward geering, Under these circumstances, he deemed it prudent to run into Beaumaris, where he landed his passengers, the greater part of whom went on from Bangor to Holyhead, by the railway, and. from thence took the steamer to Kingstown. Previous to leaving Beaumaris the passengers pre- sented Capt. Hall with the following flattering testimonial of their opinion of his seamanship under the trying cir- cumstances in which they were placed, and in acknow- ledgment of his intrepi i conduct in endeavouring to save the lives of those on board the William Rushton We, the passengers on board the Minerva, which left Liverpool on the 19th instant, at seven o'clock, p.iii., much as we regret the fatal collision which occurred between her and the brig William Rushton, cannot fail to record out- sense of the gallant conduct of Capt.

{"ocr": "FATAL COLLISION AT SEA. On Tuesday morning a frightful collision took place be- tween the ftearner Minerva (plying between Liverpool and Kingstown) and the brig; William Rushton, the con- sequences of which are the lo &of seven lives and the total destruction of the William Rushton. As far as we were able to collect the circumstances of the case up to the timeof our going to press Tuesday night, they are as follows :-Ou Monday evening the Minerva left Liver- pool at 7 o'clock, in company with the Iron Duke, both vessels beinn bound for King-town During the whole of the evening it blew very hard from W. S W.. and the Minerva. not being able to make much way, ke, t on the Welsh coast. About I o'clock, Tues lay morning, when the Minerva was between Puffin Island and P\"int Lvna*. a 8rrange -ail wfS de-cried close upon the steamer. The vessel proved to be the William Rushton. from Laguua, on the coant of Mexico, heavily laden with maho^auy and a few parcels of a general cargo. As far as our information goes the brig was not observed by the steamer until she was close upon her, the former showing no light. We have on the othet hand, been informed that the people in the brig Saw the steamer's lights some ten minutes before the frightful col- lision which eventually occurred. Immediately on the brig being seen coming in the direction of the steamer it was clear to all on board that a collision was inevitable, and, consequently, the engines were at once reveised, the helm put hard up, and. as far as our information goes, everything done to mitigate the effects of a calamity which seemed unavoidable. Only a few moments elapsed after the brig was first seen before the bowsprit of the steamer came in contact with her, striking her about midships, and the collision was a very violent one. from the circumstance that the steamer was going at full speed when she first saw the brig. and the en- gineer had therefore not time to reverse the engines in time to prevent serious consequences. As soon as Captain Hall, of the Minerva, saw what had happened, and that it was evident the brig would sink, he promptly ordered out the life-boat of the Minerva, and, although he was remonstrated with by many of the passen- gers for doing po, on the ground that such a step was rash and useless in consequence of the sea running so high at the time, he still persisted in sending the boat off, which succeeded in saving the lives of four persons on board the brig, including the captain, the cook and two seamen. The remainder of the crew, which altogether numbered eleven, were all drowned. In about ten minutes after the collision the brig sank in deep water. not a vestige of her was to be seen. The life-boat belonging to the steamer had the utmost difficulty in regaining the Minerva, as the sea was running so very high at the time. On examining the Minerva, Captain Hall found that her fore compartment was so stove in by the collision as to be completely filled with water, and the ship was considerably down by the head. He also found that she had lost her bowsprit, her .foremast, and all the running forward gearing. Under these circumstances he deemed it prudent to run the steamer intoBeaumaris, where he landed his passengers, the greater part of whom went on from Bangor to Holyhead by the. railway, and from there took the steamer to Kingstown. Previous to leaving Beaumaris the pastengers presented Captain Hall with the following flattering testimonial of the opinion of his seamanship under the trying circum- stances in which they were placed, and in acknowledgment of his intrepid conduct in endeavouring to save the lives of those on board the William Rushton:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd We, the passengers on board the Minerva, which left Li- verpool on the 19th inst., at 7 o'clock P.M., much as we regret the fatal collision which occurred between her and the brig William Rushton, cannot fail to record our seuse of the gallant conduct of Captain Johu Henry Hall, who, though at imminent danger to his own vessel, sent out his boat to remler all the assistance possible to those in the unfortunate brig and we further beg to record our high sense of the propriety and con- duct of Captain Hall on thil very trying occasion -Signed, Richard Letfe, Julius Delmege, William Chambers, Rdw8ru Garwood, James Leary, Samuel Corbisliley, Charles M'.Malier, John Mangay, Laurence Hanvige.

Nothing is known as 10 the intentions of Louis Napoleon on the question of the elecloral law; but it is understood there is great division on this subject in the republican party.

Three suicides were commit'ed on Thursday week. One was by a dressmaker, named Demeux, Rue de la Laborde, who suffocated herself by the fumes of charcoal, from, it is supposed, misery the second was by a street-sweeper, who threw himself from the third story of a house in construction in the Rue d'Astorg the third was by a workman, named Guibouges, who cut his throat in the water-closet of his lodgings, Rue de Faubourg, St. Martin. An experiment is being now made at the station at Chelles, on the Strasbourg Railway, of an ingenious piece of mechan- ism for receiving and depositing letter-bags, without stopping the trains. The accounts from the wine districts in the south of France are far from sa isfactory. It does not appear that the blight has been general, but the long-continued drought will, it is said, cause a great diminution in the quantity of wine as com- pared with average crops. SPAIN. The Madrid journals of the 19th ult., announce that the government was accelerating as much as possible the depar- ture of one thousand men, and forty Paixhans guns, intended for Cuba. The ministerial paper says-\" We can fully con- firm the important news that the English government has or- dered its naval forces to p'otect Cuba and it states that it also has made representations to the United States cabinet on the duty imposed on it of preventing piratical expeditions. The journals express the greatest satisfaction at the proceed- ing of the British government, and declare that the sentiment of indignation at the conduct of the American pirates, is uni- versal in Spain. PORTUGAL. The Peninsular mail steamer Madrid has brought intelli- gence from Lisbon to the 19th ult. The prospects of the Septembrists were more favourable, arising fiom the fact that the Queen had sent for the Duke ofTerceira, to whom she ex- pressed her great displeasure that his Grace should have joined the Cabralite faction. Her Majesty felt it necessary to give the Duke this reproof, because, she said, as he was hold- ing a high office at court, it would lead the public to believe that she was clandestinely encouraging the Cabralite party, which she altogether renounced, because she was satisfied that the feeling of the country was opposed both to Count Thomar and his government. The result of the conference was, that the Duke of Terceira promised to separate from the Cabra- tites. This act of the Queen had given great satisfaction to to the public generally. Captain Martin's squadron had sailed from Lisbon on a cruise. ITALY. The Neapolitan government has just published a paper, entitled-\" A Review of the Errors and Lies published by Mr. Gladstone.\" The Emperor of Austria made his solemn entry into Milan on the 21st. His Majesty was on horseback, and passed the garrison in review. He afterwards attendtd high mass in the cathedral. I he attitude of the people was calm and respectful.

On the 22nd. he returned to Milan, when he visited all the public institutions returning to Monza in the evening.

The English steamer Triton ran, in the night of the 24th, on to the breakwater at Ostend. The fog was very thick at the time. The passengers and crew, 180 in number, were saved. One of the Brussels journals gives the following amusing story A singular scene, which nearly ended tragically, took place three days ago at the Hotel de Sued, and Madlie. Lola iMontes played the principal part in it. It appears that the exhibition of this lady at the theatre of the Vaudeville, caused M. Arnaud, director of rhe Hippodrome, to think she might consent to appear in that establishment. M. Arnaud accordingly begged M. N-, of this city, to wait on her, and offer her 3,000f. for six representations all that was required of her, being to go on horseback two or three times round the Hippodrome. When M. N-- bad explained the motives of his visit, Madlie Lola Montes drew herself up to her full height, and examined the gentleman from head to foot. What do you take me for, sir 1\" said she. Do you know that I am a Grand Cross of tie Order of Maria Theresa; that I am Countess de Landsfeld that I have my entiees at the Court of Bavaria that I have married a man belonging to one of the most illustrious families of England Know, sir, that if I cultivate the art oi dancing, it is from taste, and that it is an insult to think me capable of taking wages from a director of mountebanks M. N-, seeing this ridiculous anger, made excuses, and declared that he saw nothing insulting in his pro- position, and that if he had, he would not have made it. Madlie. Lola became more angry, and cried, Sir, if my friends or my husband were hele. you should wipe away this insult wi.h your blood She then uttered loud cries, and M. Mabille, who is travelling with her, hastened to her. He en. deavoured to calm her, but Madlie Lola turning against him, began abusing him. AI. N-, seeing her attention turned from him, slipped away. Before M. Mabille arrived, Madlie. Lola Montes had been looking for a knife, and uttered serious threat against M. N AUSTRIA. The news from Prague has of late been discouraeing to the friends of a united Austria. A citizen was convicted of an attempt to corrupt the soldiers, and sentenced to four years' hard labour in irons, as a punishment for the offence. Drum- head law has been, in consequence, again proclaimed in cases of ihis description. Another man was found to have in his possession a quantity of arms and combustible materials. He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in a fortress. The military government at Prague has, therefore, issued a pro- clamation, enforcing anew all the conditions of \"estate of siege\" that had been relaxed in favour of the citizens. PRUSSIA. According to advices from Berlin, of the 22nd ult., the Ita- lian Sovereigns are about to form a confederation similar to the Germanic League. The confederation has a twofold ob- ject, namely, to maintain and strengthen internal order by an equal and simultaneous advance of the sovereign power in all Italian States and to render all foreign intervention from whatever quarter, unnecessary. Such a confederation would free the Pope from the French Republicans, and file Emperor of Austna, therefore, finds it expedient to proceed with this measure, in full concurrence with the other Italian rulers. A correspondent of a Prussian paper states that Prince Windischgratz has been again appointed governor of Bohemia. Rumours had been circulated that the question about the incorporation of the Austrian dependencies with the German Bund, had been made the subject of personal conference be- tween the King of Prussia and the Emperor of Austria at Ischl, but this is decidedly contradicted. RUSSIA. The inauguration of that stupendous work, the railway which connects St. Petersburgh and Moscow, took place on the 1st ult The Emperor 01 Russia, accompanied by the Empress, the principal members of the imperial family, several foreign Piinces, and attended by the high officers of state, and a numerous suite, quitted St. Peteriburgh at six o'clock on Sunday, and arrived at Moscow at half past eight o'clock the same night. LEVANT MAIL. By the Levant mail we have received Constantinople jour- nals to the 14th, and Athen journals to the 18th ult., both in- clusively. There is no news in them of importance. An Athens paper gives a very brief notice of a sitting in the Greek Senate, from which, however, we perceive that the mi- nistry experience great opposition to the new financial scheme, by which it appears the public expenditure will be considera- bly increased. Letters from Spezia, of the 22nd, stale that the inhabitants of that town on being informed that Kossuth was on board the Mississippi, made great demonstrations in honour of his arrival. The town was illuminated, rockets were let off, and a large number of boats, gaily decked out, surrounded the Mis- sissippi, saluting Kossuth with music and cheers. The Ame- rican commodoie, who is taking the waters at Lucca, has been to La Spezia to compliment him. 0V. RLAND MAIL. We learn from Trieste, under date of the 27th of Sept., of the arrival of the Adria, from Alexandria, with thirteen passengers. Our dales from Bombay are 10 the 1st of September. Gholab Singh had suppressed the outbreak in Cashmere. 1 he Kahn Heerat was dead, and Dost Mahommed had suc- ceeded him. A great quantity of rain had fallen in Sine and the Pllnjaub, which had caused inundaiion, and much loss of life and pro- perty. General Battine, Commodore Hawkins, and M. de Bethune had died. The last would probably be succeeded by Sir fi Parry. Frauds to the extent of \u00c2\u00a3 70,000 had been discovered in the opium department at Bombay. An expedition was being fitted out there against the Aiab* round about Aden. Gold was abundant, and the import trade brisk. AMERICAN NEWS. Liverpool, Sunday Morning. By the arrival in the Mersey of the Royal mail steam ship America, Shannon commander, we have received advices and letters from New York to the 16th insf., Boston to the 17th, and Halifax to the 19th. She brings 100,000 dolls. in specie, and upwards of 50 passengers. The New York papers state that the steam ship Atlantic took out instructions from the President to- Ur-llarringer. the United States Consul at Madrid, to urge upon the Spanish Government mercy and leniency towards her unfortunate and misguidtd prisoners. Intense excitement prevailed at Baltimore and throughout Pennsylvania, in consequence of a negro outrage at Christiana, by which Mr. Edward Gorsuch, the owner of the two fugitives whom he attempted to recover, was killed, and his son mortally wounded the son was not dead at last accounts, but lie was not expected to survive many hours. Several arrests of both whites and negroes supposed to be concerned in the outrage had been made, and an armed force had been sent to Christiana to prevent any further outbreak. The Government has offtred a reward cf 4,000 dollars for the arrest and conviction of the offenders. Mr. James Fenimore Cooper, 'he distinguished American novelist, expired at his residence.

The crops are reported to be looking remarkably well, especially the wheat crop. From Havannah we have telegraphic accounts, by way of Savannah, to the/th instant, one dav later, which state that 160 prisoners had sailed for Spain in a Government trans- port, and that only four had been liberated, viz., Colonel Haynes, Captain Kelly, Lieutenant Van Vechten, and Mr. Chapman. Advices from St. Domingo to the 4th instant had been re- ceived at New York by the arrival of the schooner Gray Eagle from Port-au-Platt, which s'ates that preparations were being made by the Haytian and Dominican Governments to renew warlike operations, and that the ilaycian fleet had reached Cape Hayti previous to the bailing of the Gray Eagle. Port au-Platt was on the 17th ult. visited by a very severe hurricane, which tore up large trees from the roots, and destroyed from fifteen to twenty houses. The shipping in the harbour also suffered severely. The English Braxil packet was driven on shore and totally lost a seaman be- longing to her was also drowned the schooner Sea was also driven on shore and lost, and the Norwegian brig Frarer, and schooner Chevere, had to cut away their masts to avoid the same fate. Every vessel in the harbour met with more or less damage, excepting the Gray Eagle.

A new chief, known under the name of Bon Baghela, having assem- bled a body of men from among the Zaouaouas, the Tolbas, and the other unsubniitting tribes on the southern slopes of the Djurjura. attacked on the 19th the Zaoniaof Chellata, and carried off 3,000 sheep and 300 oxen. from our chief Si Ben Ali Cherif. The latter, betrayed by his people, was obliged to fly alone, and ta^e refuge in the camp of Goum of observa- tion, under the orders ot Lieutenant Beaupretre. This suc- cess of the Cherif is likely to have a disastrous influence on our tribes, already acted on by intrigues. In order to prevent any insurrectional movement, a small column, under the order of the colonel-commandant of the sub division of Aumali, es- tablished itself among the Beni Mancours, and immediately commenced constructing a house of command for Ben Ali Cherif. The last accounts from Aumali, dated the 27th, an- nounce that the tribes which had abandoned the young Mara- bout, on the attack of the 19th, had just repulsed the Cherif Bon Baghela who, after a combat which cost him ten of his men, fled, and took refuge among the Mieldjas.\" GERMANY.

Sir,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdI have the honour to report, that at daybreak, on the morning of the 30th of January, I proceeded from this sta- tion with a force, consisting of 300 men 73rd Regiment, 150 men Cape Mounted Rifles, 1,400 Hottentot levies. 300 Fin- goes, and one six pounder\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin all 2,200 men\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdfor the purpose of throwing supplies into Forts White and Cox. About eight miles from this place a considerable number of Kafirs attacked our rear-guard, consisting of a troop of Cape Mounted Rifles and Geoadendal, Albany, and Rivers dale levies. This attack was repulsed in a very spirited man- ner. Shortly afterwards large bodies of the enemy appeared on our left, evidently bent on contesting our march across the Debe Neck. Two shells, directed with great precision by Major Wilmot, of the Royal Artillery, were thrown into the midst 01 a large group, and did great execution. No further attempt was made to impede our march on that day, and con- siderable number of the enemy were killed by the flanking parties of the levies and Cape Mounted Rifles. I arrived at Fort White about two o'clock, P.M. On the 31st of January I proceeded with the same force to Fort Cox, which I reached without any opposition. Whilst the troops were at the post, a large body of Kafirs appeared upon the brow of the hill which overlook, d the Keiskamma, on the road to Fort Hare. apparently in the expectation that we intended proceeding to that post. Two thefts were again accurately directed by Major Wilmot, and caused them considerable loss. 4 After supplying Fort Cox, I returned, without molesta- tion. to Fort White, and this day to King William's Town. I found the garrisons of Forts White and Cox in good health aud spirits. These posts are now supplied for six weeks each, and 1 have removed from them all the men who are not abso- lutely necessary for their defence. \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 I have the satisfaction of reporting to your Excellency my sense of the efficient conduct of every corps, regular and provisional, who were engaged in this service.

The owl first hooted in B flat, and it still loves the key, and screams through no other octaves. In the same key has ever ticked the death-watch; while all the three noted chirps of the cricket have ever been in B since Tubal Cain first heard them in his smithy, or the Israelites in their ash- ovens. Never has the buzz of the gnat risen above the second A; nor that of the house-fly's wing sunk below the first F. Sound had at first the same connection with colour as it has now; and the right, angle of light's incidence might as much produre a sound on the first turrets of Cain's city, as it is now said to do on one of the pyramids. The tulip, in its first bloom in Noah's garden, emitted heat four and a half degrees above the atmosphere, as it does at the present. The stormy petrel as much delighted to sport amongst the first billows which the Indian ocean ever raised, as it does now. In the first migration of birds, they passed from north to south, and fled over the narrowest part of the seas, as they will this autumn. The cuckoo and the nightingale first began their song together, analogous to the beginning of our April, in the days of Nimrod. Birds that lived on flies had laid bluish eggs in the days of Joseph, as they will two thousand years hence, if the sun should not fall from his throne, or the earth not break her harness from the planetary car. The first bird that was caged oftener sung in adagio than in his natural spirit. Corals have ever grown edge- ways to the ocean stream. Eight millions two hundred and eighty thousand animalcule could as well live in a drop of water in the days of Seth as now. Flying insects had on their coats of mail in the days of Japhet, over which they have ever waved plumes of more gaudy feathers than the peacock ever dropped The bees that afforded Eve her first honey made their combs hexagonal and the first house-fly produced twenty millions eighty-three hundred and twenty eggs in one year, as she does at present. The first jump of thy first flea was two hundred times its own length, as it was the su'nmer. There was iron enough in the blood of the first forty-two men to make a ploughshare, as there is to-day, from whatever country you collect them. The lungs of Abel contained a coil of vital matter one hundred and fifty- nine feet square, as mine and the first inspiration of Adam consumed seventeen cubic inches of air, as do those of every adult reader. The rat and the robin followed the footsteps of Noah, as they do ours. SPORTING SCENES AND ANECDOTES IN THE WILDS OF I TEXAS AND NEW MEXICO. While speaking of the rattlesnake among the prairie dogs, 1 I may as well add a few words in relation to his snakeship. These venomous creatures abound through the plains of Texas and New Mexico. We met them continually in our path, and they always gave us notice of their proximity by shaking their rattles. Often did I hear this warning without discovering the enemy; and on such occasions it is best to get out of the way. The rattlesnakes never attack except when provoked; and they are easily killed. A blow with a stick will disable them, when they are readily dispatched. The young men of the expedition were fond of shooting them with their pistols, but so much ammunition was wasted in this snort. if it mav be so called, that it became necessary to issue an order forbidding it. We had some experience of the effect of the bite of this snake. As we were approach- ing the Concho river, one of our horsemen discovered a large rattlesnake directly in our trail. He gave him a shot from his six-shooter, which took effect, nearly cutting his body in two. He then attempted to ride over him, when the snake raised his head and struck the horse in the hind leg, about a foot above the hoof. Several saw the effort of the snake, and we stopped to see whether any injury had been done. We at once discovered the marks where the fangs entered, from which the blood was oozing. Within five minutes the horse, which was a very fine one, began to limp. Soon after his legs began to swell, so that he could not walk on it, and it was with difficulty that he could be led into camp, so great appeared to be his agony. Within half an hour we reached our camp, and proceeded to alleviate, the sufferings of the poor animal. A small air pump was applied first, and some blood drawn from the wound; poultices were afterwards applied, and the horse was watched with care during the night, as he lay at length on the grass. In the morning his entire leg and thigh were much swollen nevertheless he was led along. after the waggons. After a few days the swelling subsided, but he showed symptoms of sickness, which in- creased, so that we were at last compelled to abandon him. We saw many other snakes of different kinds, some of them of the most brilliant colours, which were safely put away in alcohol. There is one species known as the chicken snake,\" which at first gave us much alarm. This snake was always found in tops of trees, moving with as much rapidity from branch to branch as a squirrel. For this motion his form seemed admirably adapted by its great length, which was from five to eight feet, though his body was not larger than that of other snakes of half the length. The chicken snake, I afterwards learned from Texans in the party, is harmless. These men would catch them by their tails and snap them like a whip. How they derived their name, I know not. This much is certain, there are no chickens in the neighbourhood where we met them. It is possible, however, that in the settled portions of Texas they may infest the poultry yard.-Coi-)-esponde,it of Aloittreal Coin lev. VAGRANTS, TRAMPS, AND BEGGARS. In my report on Carlisle, it is stated that nearly 6,000 vagrants (0,72-5, mate and female) have been relieved with a bed, and passed through the borough, in one year.\" This does not, however, represent the actual number of tramps and vagrants who have passed through or harboured about and in the district: and in that district Penrith is included. This amount of vagrancy could not exist, if the misdirected charity upon which it preys were withdrawn. Those who give readily, generally give foolishly, and are indirectly the cause of much evil and mischief. Vagrancy subsists by deceit and fraud. The professional vagrantjis a beggar and thief, as it may suit his or her purpose, but ever an impostor of the worst kind. Charity, excepting to the old, infirm, or sick, is more fre- quently a curse than a blessing; because it fosters able- bodied idleness, encourages licentiousness, and these lead on to crime. Nine-tenths of the petty thefts and some of the greater crimes, murders, &c., throughout the country, are committed by the tramping vagrants, who find accommoda- tion in the lodgirig-house.3 in every town and in every village on the main line of road throughout the kingdom. The condition of so'cietyimay be compared to a slumbering volcano, so long as these hotbeds of vice exist, unchecked or uncontrolled; men, women, and children, the young and the old, herd together without regard to one single feeling of modesty or decency. There are several beds in one room (I have seen twelve) crowded close together for the most part they have no form of separation the right of admission con- sists in the ability to pay the charge, for half, one-third, or one fourth of a bed, Id., or 211., or 3d., as the case may be. I have seen seven persons occupying the space of one bed four in it tvo at the head and two at the feet, and three under it; two women and two men in beds touching two women and one man in the same bed, as also two men and one voniin girls of 12 or 14 years of age in the same bed with grey-headed old men, and this in a room with other beds similarly occupied. The males strip themselves naked before laying down. The diseased sleep with the healthy and women are confined and delivered in such rooms. The pen of the novelist never yet described depravity half so gross, immorality and vice half so rampant, or huma.n misery half so intense, as may be found every night, almost at the door of any individual who chooses to think about the subject, and look for the facts. The \"intense wickedness\" as ex- hibited by the mob at the execution of the Mannings, pro- ceeded from the ordinary nightly denizens of crowded courts and common lodging-house, seen in mass, under excitement. There is, however, no reason to think that these people were worse than tens of thousands of the same class, scattered over the surface of the country, and who are as truly main- tained by society at large, as if the money were paid daily or weekly in tihe form of wages. From what I have seen and learned of the mode of life and habits of these vagrant tramps, I do not hesitate to affirm, that, man for man, they levy and consume more of the capital of the country than the same number of able-bodied labourers. Ragged schools may be established; juvenile crime reformatories and in- dustrial schools may be erected; baths and wash-houses may be opened museums, libraries, and reading-rooms may ba free to all lectures may be cheap, instructive, and enter- taining;\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdbut for what purpose ? If the poor are allowed to wallow in filth and immorality not to be described; to live from their birth to the grave surrounded by pestilence, and ever breathing an atmosphere loaded with the seeds of disease,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdeducation will not better their condition, baths will not cleanse them, or museums amuse; neither will gaols reform them. If vagrants can obtain more by deception and importunity, than by honest labour, able-bodied vagrants will abound; crime and imposture is their trade, immorality is their pleasure. Leave common lodging-houses unregu- lated, and they will not want occupants; leave the hard- working poor their filth and misery, to which they must daily and nightly return, and they will look tor other stimu- lants than those which elevate and refine. The poor cannot, in sanatory matters, improve their own condition they must occupy such houses as exist. The improvements must be provided for them, and there is no truer economy, even as regards pounds, shillings, and pence, than in constructing cottages affording the means of health and comfort to the occupiers. Men sick, through whatever cause, or having ailing families, cannot pay rents with regularity; but they are a burden to themselves and to the whole community, generally coming upon the parish for relief. But the union- house, howeiver well regulated, works no change the pauper discharged, falls again into filth and misery\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdagain to. become a burden to society.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMr. R. Raiolinson's Sanatory Report un Penrith. r REMAINS QF EASTERN FEELINGS RESPECTING WOMEN I IN SPAIN. Here in the Baleatic Islands there are fewer traditions of Moorish time than in Spain; the extirpation of the race seems to have been more complete than anywhere else the names of the pudplos alone continue to attest the dominion which endured for more than five centuries. Yet, while no such gorgeous relics as the Alcazar of Seville, the Alhambra of Granada, or the Mosque of Cordova remain, there is far more of the Moorish spirit combined and amalgamated with the Christian than on the continent. The African bornouse is worn by the peasantry, and the caross is their defence against rain, as much here as in Asia Minor. Their songs are pe- culiarly Moorish. I have heard the same slow monotonous ditties among the mountains of Anatolia, and I have felt that there were some points not of resemblance, but of identity, between those who. sung them and the race I had left in the far-off Balearic Islands. But a far more unmis- takeable token is to be found in the seclusion in which the women of the higher classes for the most part live. The custom is, when it can be adopted, for the gentlemen to occupy almdst exclusively the cuarto pi-inci?al or the chief portion of the house. Thus a visit paid to a gentleman in Majorca does not bring the visitor in contact with the female part of the family; nor does a visit to a lady make acqnaintance with any of the unfair sex.\" This separation is looked upon as a great advantage by all parties, and where there are no entresols, and, yet one family occupy a house, the gentlemen carry themselves and their belongings a storey higher, in order still to plice the ladies alone in the cuarto principal. Here, as in Spain, each gentleman takes his own wife to dinner, dances with her first (if there be dancing) and sits by her when she\" unfatigues herself,\" an occupation which takes up the greater part of Spanish life. Any innova- tion upon, this primitive practice is regarded as a French fashion, and not looked upon by the middle classes with any particular favour. French fashions are notwithstanding gaining ground, as being more social and cheerful, and in newiy-built Spanish theatres the cazuela is not to be found. This is a portion fronting the stage, separated from the rest, of the house, and approached by doors of its own: it is for ladies only, and the mantilla is always worn; nor is a gen- tleman permitted, on any account whatever, to put his pro- fane foot in it. It is an unsanctified nunnery, the inmates of which are bound by no vows, and is made as dark and un- inviting as possible. It rejoices in the unromantic name of the hen-coop.\" I was taken into the cazuela of a theatre at Burgos many years ago, when there was no performance, just as I have been present at any other season. These lit- tle peculiarities are fast vanishing, and before long Spain will have become so European as to lose half the interest which she now possesses.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdChristmas's Shores and Inlands oj the Mediterraneiwn.", "word": "2", "description": "\u2026 matter one hundred and fifty- nine feet square, as mine and the first inspiration of Adam consumed seventeen cubic inches of air, as do those of every adult reader.

A formal complaint had been made by the Ministry to the United States' government as to the Indian outrages on the frontier, which by treaty the United States are bound to protect. Mexico refuses to ratify the Tehuaut\u00c3\u00a8pec treaty as yet. The correspondents of the New York journals say there will be a deficiency on the vear to meet the exigencies of the government, amounting to 4,003,000 dollars. The Minister of Finance was endeavouring to consolidate the interior debt, and to raise a revenue. A loan of several millions of dollars was contemplated. INDIA AND CHINA. The following is the letter of our correspondent, dated Duuik\" Apnl t7- t r \"The Governor-general left Peshawur on the 18th of March, and was to have crossed the Indus on the tilst, but was detained till the 25th by the bridge of boats at Attock having been carried away by a sudden rise of the river. Lord Dalhousie will return to Calcutta during the ensuing monsoon, and it ia generally believed that he will shortly after leave India, and that the Marquess of Nor- manhy will be his successor. Letters from Peshawar state that a force of 2,000 men is about to be marched into the Affreedees' country, to destroy their crops and cultivation, but this report wants confirmation. An extra issue of the Dereea-re-Noor, pub- lished at Peshawur on the 31st of March, announces that the Ameer of Cabul, having passed ihe Hindoo-Kob, and invaded Bokhara, had attacked the Walee of Baikh, and besieged his town, after beating him in the field. During the siege two sons of the Walee fell into the hands of Dost Mohammed, who is said to have put them to death, shortly after which Baikh surrendered. The Ameer's brother, Sultan Mohammed, was encamped at Alee Musjid. \"The Deejerat frontier still continues in a disturbed state; the hill tribes are collected at the mouths of various passes, watching an opportunity for a foray, but the ar- rangements for their reception are so effective that they have not yet ventured a descent. It is expected that they will shortly disperse; for, as they cannot carry provisions for any length of time, to keep them at bay is sufficient to insure their defeat. t The harvest In the Punjab and north-west provinces is most abundant; throughout the latter districts, wheat though cultivated on capital borrowed from the village bankers at the average rate of 24 per cent., is selling for 8s. the quarter. It hi a lucky thing for the farmers of Essex, says the Delhi Gazette, that we are separated from them by a distance of half the globe. The Ganges Company's steamer Patna was lost near Bulliah on the 29th of March. Mr. Fortune, the na- turalist bad arrived at Calcutta from China, with upwards of 20,000 tea plants for the use of the Himalayan nur- series, Kemaon and burhwsll. The Assam Tea Com- pany's plantations are also rapidly increasing, and there is little doubt that in a few years tea will be extensively produced in India. \"Frauds to the amount of \u00c2\u00a3 3,500 are said to have been discovered in the Bengal Military Orphan Fund. The kingdom of Oude is at present in a state of anarchy, little inferior to that usually prevailing in the Nizam's do- minions. In the latter the Nizam still continues his own minister, with the intention, it is presumed, of making out of the revenues a private purse for himself in case of his being deposed. Suraj-ool-Moolk is intriguing for the ministry, apparently with some chance of success. \"Another attempt at assassination has been made by an Arab fanatic at Aden. Mr. Delisser, of the 78tb Highlanders, while riding out in the vicinity of the Turkish wall, was attacked and wounded by an Arab armed with a crease, who also cut through his bridle reins, but was himself cut down on the spot, and his head nearly severed from bis body by a PromPt and well- directed sword cut given by that officer. The assassin s body was brought into camp and gibbeted in terrorem. \"There is an unusual amount of public works going on at Bombay. The railway works are progressing favour- ably.

Accounts from Manilla state that, on the 28th of January, an attack had been made by the Governor-general on the forts at Sooloo, which resulted in th^ir capture, together with 140 pieces of artillery, and other munitions ot war. The Sultan and many of the inhabitants had fled to the interior. The loss on their side is not stated; that ot the attacking force was 120 killed and wounded. The de- fences of the island have been demohshed, and the sur- rounding country iaid waste. It is reported that the Spanish authorities do not intend t'o retain the possession of the island. Considerable shipments of Chinese coolies still continue to be made to the west coast of America and to the Sand- wich Islands. The import market at Canton has been rather inactive during the month. At Shanghai it has been more buoy- ant. In tea the transactions have been on a fair scale at both places, but particularly in the north, where the re- mainioij crops of Congou ou the market have been cleared off at high rates. At Canton the high prices ruling have checked the export, and Home vessels tailing of getting loaded, alter waiting a length of lim*. have left.

Years may pass over her head, but, if benevolence and virtue dwell in her heart, she is as cheerful as when the spring of life first opened to her view. When we look upon a good woman, we never think of her age; she looks as charming as when the rose of youth first bloomed on her clieek, That rose has not faded yet it will never fade. In her neighbourhood, she is the friend and benefactor.

MOUNTAIN- LIFE IN MERIONETHSHIRE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe mountain dis- tricts are marked by many long cwms, or peaty vallies, through which rivers run sluggishly before defending to the glens or low- lands. Farm-houses are scattered along the sides of the hills which from these cwms, the inhabitants of f/hieh are a simple pastoral people. They depend almost entirely on sheep and cattle\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdon wool and the produce of the dairy\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdfor support.; for they are often unable to mise sufficient oats and potatoes for family Tire. Dealers visit them periodically, who purchase their produce in the lump; and with these exceptions, except at country fairs and merrymakings, a family rarely sees a human being besides its neighbours, Mountain farms are not measured by acres, but by the number of cattle or \"sheeps they may be considered able to tnlantain. Some farmers keep large flocks of the latter one in tHe bUs between Trawsfynycid and Bala maintained, on a farm icntedat about \u00c2\u00a370 more than 1,200 sheep another in the same district, who only paid \u00c2\u00a315 rent, kept, we are told, 200 of these small h aidy creatures. Goats were reared in great numbers until a recent eriod but they do not pay so well as sheep, and, where plantations exist injure bark. The mode of life is primitive. The servants iive ill-tlle farm-house, the men usually sleeping in a small i uihling attached. The master's family and the servants dine in the kitchen together, but at separate tables.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY. The news by electric telegrah from Trieste, anticipating the Indian Mail from Bombay of November 12 says that Bombay is tranquil. Dost Mohammed is dying. Sir C. Campbell's, force retook Michense, and drove back the enemy to the mountains without loss. An engagement of cavalry took place on the frontiers of Debra Ismai Khan. The Governor-General was expected at Cahutta on the 10th of January. Her Majesty s steamer Fox has been ordered to Rangoon, to demand satisfaction for injuries done to Englishmen. The ships Bengali and Sea enfiene had been lost in a violent gale near Calcitta. The ship Tayn had been captured near Penang, and all the Europeans on board murdered by Malays of her crew. The Nizam had paid the full amount due tc the East India Company. Riots have taken place at Ienar and Gwalior. The American Presidents message has been broight to Liverpool by the steam ship Africa. It has was delivered on Tuesday the 2nd. The president complunts that certain Cubans resident in the United States h..e a second time made that country the scene for the equip- ment of military expeditions against the possessions of her Spanish Majesty. To severe a judgment, says the Message, cannot be passed upon those who by fraudident reprsen- tations led these thoughtless young men into peril and disgrace. Though the invaders had forfeited the protec- tion of their country, no proper efforts had been, or will be, spared to obtain the release of those now in conSne- ment, for the sake of their families and friends. The President advocates adherence to the new neutrality and non-intervention policy. Our true mission,\" he says,\" is not to propagate our opinions, to impose upon other coun. tries our form of government hy nrtific** or fnmo, but -to teach by example, and show by our success, moderation and justice, the blessings of self-government and the ad- vantages of free institutions.\" I .I The correspondence with England and France respect- ing the invasion of Cuba is referred to and tnbmitted. It maintains the principle on the part of the United States, that in every regularly documented merchant vessel the crew who navigate it and those on board of it will find their protection in the flag that is over them. No American vessel can be allowed to be visited or searched for the purpose of ascertaining the character of individuals on board, nor can there be allowed any watch by the vessels of any foreign nations over American vessels on the coast of the United States, or seas adjacent thereto. The reference to Kossuth is brief. In a com- munication to the Department of State, he has presented his acknowledgments for the interposition of the Govern- ment, and Congress is recommended to consider in wba: manner he and his companions, brought hither by its authority, shall be received and treated. The remainder of the speech is financial and commer. cial. The Prometheus was fired at by the English brij of war Express at San Juan, in con sequence, as it ii stated, of trying to evade the payment of certain harbour dues, &c. The news from California is of the most cheer- ing character. The rebels in Mexico havereceind rein- forcements, and were about to renew hostilities. The Island off Sicily, had been swept away by two immense:Spherical bodies of water, reaching from the clouds, their cones nearly touching the eatth, and, as far as could be judged, at a quarter of a mile a part, tra- velling with immense velocity. They passed over the island near Marsala. Houses were unroofed, trees uprooted, men and women, horses, cattle, and sheep were raised up, drawn into their vortex, and borne on to destruction during their passage rain descended in citaracts, accom- panied with hailstones of enormous size and masses of ice. Going over Castelamare, near Stabia, they destroyed half the town, and washed 200 of the inhabitants into the sea, who all perished. Upwards of 500 persons have been de- troyed by this terrible visitation, and an immense amount of property, the country being laid waste for miles. The shipping in the harbour suffered severely, many vessels being destroyed, and their crews drownsd, numbers of dead human bodies were picked up, all frightfullyi mutilated and swollen. Little doubt is entertained in Paris of the election o Louis Napoleon, by a large majority. Many of his op- ponents will vote for him, because they know that if he were in a minority the army would not allow him to retire, but would proclaim him Emperor. Under the belief that he will be elected, and that all will go on well, the funds have risen quietly. Louis Napoleon has just gained great popularity by a Decree ordering the im- mediate execution of the long-projected railroad round Paris to connect all the lines and facilitatel circulation. The Assembly would not vote the line, although it would give employment to many thousands of workmen. Ano- ther Decree, reducing the tax on labour, has also given much satisfaction. Louis Napoleon, however, is prepar- ing something much greater: the abolition of the octroi duties. This will gain him the hearts of all honest, industrious workmen. The seals have been taken off the journals, and most of them have re-appeared. The only journals which have not re-appeared are the Socialist organs. M. de Girardin, of the Presse, has retired altogether. The departure of M. Thiers from Paris was a forced one. He was sent to the railroad older an escort of the police, for it was discovered that he had begun again to intrigue for the Orleanists. All the ex-Repre- sentatives of the Legitimist and Orleanist parties have been released from prison except eight or ten, who refuse to give their word to abstain from polities. Warrants are out against Michel (de Bourges) and Victor Hugo, for they were chief exciters in the late insurrection. 1 ans has resumed its usual aspect, and is even gay. Trade, on the whole, is not bad; but the hotels are empty there being no arrivals. The telegraphic dispatches from the disturbed Departments announce the submission of large bands of Socialists. Many of their chiefs have been shot.

I therefore, endeavoured, immediately after my arrival at Constantinople, to ascertain if there is any proba- bility its to the liberation of the illustrious patriot. I was informed by the best sources iliat the Porte had solemnly declared to the Austrian government that the Sultan had fulfilled the pledge given in the auto- graph letter of September, 1849, and as peace has not been disturbed in the states of the Austrian em- pire, site caunoi detain any longer the Hungarian re- fugees, and is willing to restole then) to full freedom, which is their natural right, in the hope that the jus- tice of the cause, the power of the Pone, and the good will of England and France, will protect her against every aggression of Russia and Austria which might ensue from the liberation of Kossuih. But the despatch of Prince Schwarzenberg claims the further detention of the Hungarians for two years more, and it is now lo be decided if England has any influence in the East, or if Russia lull's without control m Constantinople.^ If Sir Stiat ot Canning cannot prevail against M. Ti'oflT in a cause where justice and the European sympathies go hand in hand with the intent ions of the Sultan, then Eng- land has no longer any need of an ambassador in Constantinople; the squadron in the Mediterranean can easily return to Spllhead, no Turk will ever have any more doubt that there is but one real Emperor in Europe\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe Czar For, he sees it, that every order from St. Petersburg, is complied with all over the world, and he believes, therefore, that Down- ing stieet is nothing else than the branch establish meltt of St. Petersburgh, and Lord Palmerston hut the first clerk of the omnipotent Czar. You do not imagine how anxiously the expectation is raised about the ultimate decision of this cause; eveiy- body feels it that it is the decisive diplomatic battle between England and Russia, and if England is out- generalled again, as it has Wen for this Inst twenty- five years, all the liberal speeches of Lord Palmer- ston, which insure him the majority in the House of Commons, are in vain; they cannot maintain the English IIlfluence in the East, for the lurks draw their conclusions from facts not from words. In the meantime the tidings from Kutaja are of a sinister kind, for the last weeks the rumour is car- rent that frequent cases of poisoning have happened at Smyrna, at tsnxd, and there is no doubt that in Kutaja four persons at least met an untimely death by arsenic. The excited people curse the Russians, for they feel instinctively that all the evils of Turkey come fromHussia. The detained Hungarian refugees, are now in con- tinual fear of being poisoned, so much the more as -the Turkish authorities themselves had warned them it, Sl,umia as well as iii Kutaja against Austrian assassins. They all have been of course long ago condemned to death by the Austrian couit-martial, and the Austrian government was never too particular as to ilie execution of a death-warrant. Who can, therefore, assure the refugees, that instead of the usual powder and lead or the halter, the Austrian govern- ment will not resort to arsenic? The result is the same, and the inducement to do is now stronger than ever, since the Sultan has declared that he is willing to set Kossuth at liberty And if an accident should happen at Kutaja, wOllid not the Turkish government be accused of a want of watchfulness? and would there not be raised a general outcry against England, thai it has not supported theS.iltan, when he declared his intention to set Kossuth at liberty, but had not \u00e2\ufffd\u00a0the energy to do it without delay. \"I", "word": "1", "description": "\u2026 precarious condition, so much so that General La Vega had been despatched from Mexico to command against tlie Indians The latter had the advantage in the recent conflicts with the whiles, and by the latest accounts, \\]t\u00bb ch 10, contemplated a descent upon the city of \\ienda.

{"ocr": "[ FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. I I FRANCE. I France is tranquil; but the contentions and intrigues of the Assembly, the want of confidence in the President, and the undiminished rancour of the Mountain, do not seem to bode a Jon continuance of quiet. The indispo- sition of the monicd interest to adopt the terms offered by the Minister of Fiuance, seems also to look like ap- prehension. In the French Chamber, the debates have been enli- vened as usual by individual peculiarities. 011 Saturday, in a debate for sending emigrants to California by means of lottery, M. de Girardin jumped up, and proposed a resolution which meant that the majority of the Assembly were ready to sanction anything. For this he was ex- pelled the Assembly for three days. I GERMANY. I The Dresden Conferences have begun\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwhen they will end it is not so easy to say. At present all is holiday compliment, and the diplomatists are full of smiles and graces. The work of the larger states is, of course, cut and dried, and, no doubt, it is pretty well understood how the smaller states will act Still the long-growing democracy of the secondary states cannot be got rid of by chicanery and word-spinning. It has taken deep root, is the genuine growth of conviction, and can no more be suppressed than printing or steam. Already there are symptoms of a felt necessity to popularise the confederation in some degree. The obnoxious minister of Hesse Cassel is superseded for one less odious. Prussia is issuing an amnesty, and authority is upon its best behaviour. Austria is in the agonies of raising a loan, and finite it difficult to sustain her sinking credit. Tyranny is doing her worst in Hesse Cassel, and Aus- trian and Bavarian troops are coercing the civic function- aries. A more absurd and degrading state for a Monarch to be in cannot be well conceived. Oppressing his own subjects with foreign soldiers. Schleswig-Holstein is fast approaching to the same condition except that her rulers are better provided with authority and means of asserting it. But with 25,000 Austrian troops on the frontier and the Go- vernments of Europe against them, they must be overborne. I ITALY, GREECE, &c. I The second half century seems destined to bring forth more extraordinary changes than even the one now ex- piring. The unrest of the peoples of Europe is greater than ever, and is manifested in a variety of ways. The soberest journals tell us Italy is from end to end, fraught with hatred of things as they are, and cannot be much longer so utterly repressed. Sicily is again in revolt. Naples is eaten up with Jesuit intrigues. Switzerland is in a state of emotion,\" and is filled with French and Italian refugees. The Ionian Islands have caught the contagion of free- dom, and have put forward a spirited piotest against British domination, desiring to be restored to the Hel- lenic Nation. We have seen too much of modern Greek character to sympathise very earnestly with these Ionian patriots but the statement has truth in it, and as part of the elements of revolutionary combustion still threat- ening Europe, they are not to be left out of the calcula- tion. Mazzini is supposed to be in Piedmont for the purpose of revolutionizing Italy. The Cardinals are in dismay at the anti-papal movement in England, and will now gladly settle their dispute with the King of Sardinia. I TURKEY. I THE HUNGARIAN REFUGEES. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Gomer Polski announces that the affair of the Hungarian refugees has been finally arranged. America has offered them an asylum, which they have accepted, and has undertaken to provide for their wants; the Ottoman government pays their expenses to Liverpool, and the English go- vernment their expenses from thence to America. This arrangement was proposed by the Ottoman government, and acceded to by England and America. On the 3rd instant, the examinations of the Turkish schools took place in the presence of the Sultan, and prizes were distributed to the pupils by the Grand Vizier. The schools on the present footing have been but recently established, and the extension given to such useful institutions is mostly due to Kemal Effendi, who a short time since visited England.

The Secretary of the Treasury had issued his annual statement of the ifnances of the country. The document is very able and elaborate. He estimates the balance to credit for 1851 at 458,997 dollars, against 6,604,545 dol- lars for 1850. The public debt for this year is less by 495,277 dollars than last year.

The Secretary then submits to Congress a modification of the present revenue laws, including a change in the present ad valorem system, which should impose specific duties upon all articles to which such duties may be safely applied, with home valuations upon all such as are sub- jected to ad valorem rates. Should specific duties not be adopted, then a home valuation should be adopted. If neither of these changes should be thought proper, he deemed it highly necessary that the present rate of duty should be increased on a great variety of articles, which it would be found were able to bear such an increase. He also recommends that the time for which goods may be kept in store shall be extended to three years, with the privilege of export without payment of duties. Our political advices are unimportant.

This is an exaggeration, probably for the purposes of creating alarm against the enemies of order and rousing its friendp to exertions. It appears from an authentic source that many of the communes in the Basses Alpes are already freed from the presence of the Socialists. Several distinguished members of the Legitimist and Orlean ist parties sent in their adhesion to-day to the Government. 011 the statement of a Lindon journal, that the Prince de Joinville and the Duke d'Aumale intended to place them- selves at the head of a movement in France, there has been a meeting of some of the chiefs of the Orleanist party, at which it was unanimously resolved to write to the Prince and declare that they could not support any attempt on his part to keep up a civil war. Most of the leading members of the Mountain against whom warrants are out, have avoided arrest, but it is supposed that most of them are still in Paris. Victor Hugo was safe up to Wednesday. The President of the Republic has received several letters warning him to be on his guard against assassins, but he pays little, if any, attention to them. lie goes out, it is true, with guards, but in an open carriage and it is the opinion of many of his friends that he exposes himself too much at this moment. If we may judge of the state of the public funds, the ac- counts from the departments occasion little alarm. All the private letters, indeed, speak in the most confident terms of the certainty of the speedy subjugation of the Socialists. Their manifestations have evidently done much more to promote than retard the cause of Louis Napoleon. PARIS, FRIDAY, DEC. 12.

A decree declares the cessation of the extraordinary mis- sions confided to M. Duval in the eight departments of B rit- tany aud Vendee; and to M. Carlier in the three departments of the Centre; an,1 to M. Berrard in the Sonime. News from the departments is re-assuring, excepting the Basses Alpes, where, however, the chief towns, Digne and Sisterton, have been recaptured by the troops. M. Nettement has been et at liberty. MM. Creton and Duvurgier de Hauranne arc still at Viucenncs. M. Thiers arrived at Mayonce on the 10th. Several changes are made among jnclicial functionaries. General Armhi de Padua has received the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. The Correspondent of The Globe writing from Paris on Sun- day Evening says The great rise in the funds, the announcement in the Moniteur that the functions of the Com- missaries General to the departments hne ceased as they are no longer necessary, and the letter of M. de Montalembert to the Univcrs, in which he gives his adhesion to Louis Napoleon as the type of the cause of order against the bandits of France and Europe, have produced a very favourable sensation and materially augmented the feeling in favour of the President. Whatever may be said here by persons who have suffered by the coup cf etat or oy those who cannot yet reconcile them- selves to the means by which society has been saved from destruction, however satisfied they may he with the result, and whatever may be said or thought in England, the immense majority of the people in France, and even in Paris, appear to approve of what has taken place, and the general opinion is that there will he an enormous majority for the prolonga- tion of the powers of Louis Napoleon.\" GERMANY. French affairs again colour the intelligence from all parts of Europe. The German papers complain that they can get no direct intelligence from Paris, the telegraphs being all in the hands of the Governments, and at work day and night. The first effect of the news in Berlin was, to produce a rumour that the Government intended to mobilize the troops. But the Ministers lost no time in reassuring the public mind. In the sitting of Friday, M. Man teuffel said \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Gentlemen, I call upon you for your support to the Go- vernment so much the more that external events of the highest importance make it necessary to set our internal affairs in order, so that no outward danger may interrupt the firm and wise progress of our interior developement. Dan- gers do, indeed, menace us on several sides, but this state of things should not be allowed to urge us into rash measures not dictated by strong necessity. We shall not mobilize new troops, but we shall remain at our posts at whatever time we may be attacked or menaced.\" The intelligence of Louis Napoleon's successful coup d'etat had been received, it is stated, with satisfaction by the Courts of Vienna and Berlin. The Prussian newspapers are unanimous in denouncing Louis Napoleon's perfidy, and in representing his success as perilous to Germany. The Austrian journals see in it a triumph of law and order, and boast of the good understand- ing between the President and the Emperors. Dr. Marriott, who had been imprisoned at Carlsruhe by the police on a charge of circulating inflammatory papers and obscene prints, has been released after sixteen days' confine- ment, by order of the Minister of the Home Department, the authorities hauing exceeded the law. Dr. Marriott states that the publications in question were tracts against the Jesuits, and pictures of the Roman Catholic Church, such as are circulated by the Religious Tract Society in London, The pastor, Wilhelm Meinhold, the author of the Amber Witch, died on Sunday week at Charlottenburg. He was one of the leaders of the old Lutheran party in Pomerania, but had for some years lived in retirement. His son has joined the Catholic Church. SAXONY. The Dresden Chambers, convoked on the 1st, were opened on the 8th inst. The following passage of the speech from the throne, in reference to the 2ollverein is the only one of general interest \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd I have ever acknowledged the beneficial effects which have been produced by the Zollverein, the maintenance and extension of which has always been my desire. I, therefore, much regret that this object has met with some obstruction, which I feel convinced will be speedily removed. With con- fidence, therefore, I have accepted and responded to the tran- quilising assurances contained in the invitation of the Prussian Government to a Zoll Congress at Berlin. And I have particular satisfaction in remarking that the addition lately made to the Zollverein expressly contemplates, as its ultimate object, a general Zoll union of all the German states. HANOVER. j Advices from Hanover represent the opposition in the Chambers as becoming serious. The first chamber having adopted a motion, calling on George V. to realise the pro- mised reforms, and safeguard the independence of the kingdom against the interference of the Diet, the second chamber has now pronounced in favour of a similar motion, preferring its desires, however, in a more conciliatory form, and confining itself to the expression of a wish. M. Stiive, chief of the opposition before March, 1848, and afterwards minister, will, it is expected, shortly reappear in the chamber to support the constitution and oppose the new treaty. Con- stitutional addresses in support of the vote of the chambers reach the ministry from several towns, especially from Osnabruck. The so-called Hungarian emissary, lately ar- rested by the Austrians at Rendsburg, has just been hurried off to Vienna, under strong escort, to be tried by a council at war. DENMARK. j The Kolner Zeitung states from Berlin that the troubles in France have already had some effect on the Schleswig- Holstein question. The Russian Cabinet has made urgent representations to the Courts of Vienna and Berlin, and the negotiations with Denmark, which had been allowed-to rest, have again been resumed with great zeal. SPAIN. In the sitting of the chamber of Deputies on the 5th, the President of the Council read a telegraphic despatch from Paris of the 2nd inst., announcing the dissolution of the As- sembly and the subjection of Paris to a state of siege; He declared that whatever events took place in France, Spain had nothing to fear for the throne, for its institutions, nor for public order. The Chamber of Deputies rejected by 141 votes to 24, the proposed impeachment of the President of the Council for having awarded indemnities to the firm of Bertram de Lis. It afterwards proceeded to discuss the budget of the Marine de- partment. The journals contain no news of importance. \"0. PORTUGAL. The recent measures of the Portuguese Government have excited much serprise in Lisbon. Instead of making a deter- mined effort to free itself from financial embarrassment it has rashly resolved to increase the expenditure of the country, making no provision for the augmentation, except the capital- isation of the dividends due on the National Debt for the half of the year 1850, the whole of 1851, the first half of 1852 and a large sum payable to the Bank of Portugal for interi s. The decree in which this is promulgated also included all the arrears due on the Civil List, as well as the balance due for army lupplies during 1846 and 1817. The sum thus added to the National Debt is \u00c2\u00a3 2,800,000. The necessary effect has been to increase the distrust of all who have an v interest in the public funds they hane so frequently been assured that former additions to the nation's responsibility were to be final, that they have now well nigh given up hope. The members of the Cabinet are much blamed for the jobbing which they have sanctioned. They are accused of having given many of their personal and political friends notice of the decree which was in preparation, and thus enabled them to sell at considerable advantage. Thousands of families will it is thought, be brought to indirence, and public credit is so shaken that no one will be found willing to invest his savings in the Funds. The continued drought also tends to incaease the general alarm. Scarcely a shower of rain has fallefl since the month of May. At the present time the weather is as bright and the sky as clear as in summer; and great fears are entertained that next year's supply of corn. oil, and other articles of agricultural produce, must be very deficient. I INDIA. (Ry ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH FROM TRIESTE.) BOMBAY, NOV. 12. Bombay is tranquil. Dost Mohammed is dying. Sir C. Campbell's forces re-took Michenee, and drove back the enemy to the mountains without loss. An engagement of cavalry took place on the frontiers of Dehra Ismail Khan. The Governor-General was expected at Calcutta on the 10th of Jonuory. Her Majesty's steamer Fox had been ordered to Rangoon to demand satisfaction for injuries done to Englishmen. The ships Bengali and Scaunfiene had been lost in a vio- lent gale near Calcutta. The ship Tayn had been captured near Penang, and all the Europeans on board murdered by Malays crew. The Nizam had paid the full amount due the East India Company. Riots had taken place at Berar and Gwalior. CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. PLYMOUTH, FRIDAY, DEC. 12. The General Steam Screw Shipping Company's mail packet Propontis, Captain Glover, arrived from the Cape of Good Hope at 11 o'clock last night. Total time consumed in the homeward passage 33 days 8 hours, from which deduct stoppages 2 days 11 hours, leaves entire time at sea of only 33 days 13 hours. The Propontis hall brought passengers from the Cape- Major Fordyce, 74th Regiment, and servant Cornet Gab- bath, 12th Lancers and from Sierra Leone Mr. liainy. Her cargo consists of 13 packages of specie, value about \u00c2\u00a3 4,500, 123 bales of wool, 10 bales of sheep skins, 35 cases of pepper, 3 boxes of ostrich feathers, 14 aum. of wine, and 27 packages of sundries. After coaling she proceeds to London. The Governor-General, Sir Harry Smith, retains his posi- tion at King William's Town. On the 14th and 16th of October a portion of General Somerset's division, tinder Colonels Michel and Fordyce, encountered the Catfres at Waterkloof, and killed hundreds of them. The success of our troops would, it is said, have been followed up in that direction but for an expected assem- bly of the enemy at Bllnkwater, where Macomo intended to head them. At the Waterkloof affair Lieutenant Norris was killed, Captain Addison, of the Royals, wounded, and Ensign Rickets, of 91st, severely wounded also 10 rank and file killed, and 20 wounded. Captain Austen, of the 73d, has been accidentally killed by the fall of a hnrse, not in action. The commissariat of the troops is not so deficient as has been represented. The maintenance of the native levies is much more costly than that of the regular forces. Rations are served out daily to families of the levies, who sometimes consist of seven or eight persons, and the system is open to fraud. There is no present fear for the safety of Graham's-town blood miht be shed, but it is extremely improbable that the place could he captured by the Caffres. The arrival of the last troops from England gave great confidence a very considerable addition must however, be made to insure the expulsion of the enemy to the eastward of the river Kei. The protraction of the present costly contest is the means of teaching the Catfres the art of war; and in order to bring hostilities to a rapid close a most powerful demonstration must be made. Patos continued adhesion is more to be attributed to the ill state of his health than to any disinclination to join the aggressive chiefs and although Kreli is counted faithfui, his people plunder the colonists at all points. The present cost of the Caffree war amounts to \u00c2\u00a3 112,000 per month. oetnl)pr it tl,,e In :m cnnancmpnt nn the 33d of October at the AVat??dnnf the 60th Rifle's and the artillery wero of immense service in dismaying the enemy. It i,aid that the Assistant-Commis- sioners lloutge aud Owell are, with 1,500 men to proceed to the Sovereignty to settle the affairs of that province. The Kliss ltiver Boers, in Natal, being alarmed at the hostile conditions of the Zulu chief, Panda, appealed to Pre- forms, who threatened that if Panda moved lie would sweep him from the face of the earth. The suspected Hottentot levies at Fort Hare hive been disarmed. A small vessel laden with gunpowder has been captured at the mouth of the Umziinvooboo River. Tile new constitution for the Cape colony conveyed out by the Propontis was, on arrival, forwarded from Cape Town by Mr. Montague, the Colonial Secretary, to the Governor- General at King William's Town. Its transit and return would occupy a period of 14 days. This delay lias created considerable dissatisfaction at Cape Town. At the Cape of Good Hope much activity was exhibited by the buyers of wool, and growers realising higher prices than for the two previous seasons \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Is. to is.

By the Royal mail steam-ship Africa, Captain Ryrie, which has just arrived in the Mersey, we have advices from New York to the 3d inst: The President1? Message was delivered on Tuesday, the 2nd. The President complains that certain Cubans resident in the United States have a second time made that country the scene for the equipment of militaiy expeditions against the possessions of Her Spanish Majesty. Too severe a judgment, says the Message, cannot be passed upon those who by fraudulent representations led those thoughtless young men int > peril and disgrace. Thrmgh the invaders had forfeited the protection of their couiitr)-, iio proper efforts had been, or will be. spared tu obtain the re- lease of those now in confinement, for the sake of their fami- lies and friends. The President advocates adherence to our new neutrality and non-intervention p11cy. Our true mission, he says, is not to propagate our opinions, to impose upon other conn- tries our form of government by artifices of force, but to teach by example, and show by our success, moderation, and justice the blessings of self-government and the advantages of free institutions. The correspondence with England and France respecting the invasion of Cuba is retened to and submitted. It maintains the priiicipif. oil the part of the United States, that in every regularly documented merchant vessel the crew who navigate it and those 011 board of it will find their pro- tection in the flag that is over them. No American vessel can be allowed to be visited or searched for the purpose of ascertaining the character of individuals on board, nor can there be allowed any watch by the vessels of any foreign nations over American vessels on the coast of the United States, or seas adjacent thereto. The reference to Kossuth is brief. In a communication to the Department of State, he has presented his acknowledgments for the interposition of the Government, and Congress is recommended to consider in what manner he and his companions, brought hither by its authority, shall be received and treated. The aggregate receipts for the last fiscal Far were 52,312,979 87 dollars, with the balance on hand at the com- mencement, making the means of the Treasury for the year 58,917,524 36 dollars, against 48,005,878 66 dollars. The imports of the ye.r ending June 30, 1851, were 215,725,995 dollars, of which 4,957,901 dollars were in specie. The exports were 227,.517,130 dollars, of which 57,854,655 55 dollars were domestic, and 9,738,695 dollars foreign products. Specie exported, 29,231,880 dollars since December last. The payments of principal of the debt were 7,501,456 56 dollars, which is inclusive of 3,242,400 dollars paid under the 12th article of the treaty with Mexico, and 2,591,212 45 dol- lars awards under the late treaty with Mexico. The public debt, exclusive of stock authorised to be issued for Texas, was 62,560,395 2G dollars. The receipts for the next fiscal year are estimated at 51,800,000 dollars, making, with the balance on hand, the available means of the year 63,258,743 00 dollars. The expenditnre is estimated at 528,922,991 91 dollars, of which 33,343,198 is for ordinary purposes of Government, and 9,549,101 11 for purposes consequent upon the acquisition of territory from Mexico. It is estimated that there will be an unappropriated balance of 20.366,443 90 dollars in the Treasury on the 30th of June, 1853, to 362,379,313 51 dollars public debt on the 1st of July following. The value of the domestic exports for the year ending June 30. 1851, show all increase of 43,643,322 dollars, which is owing to the high psice of cotton during the first half of the year, and the price of which has since declined one half. The value of the exports of breadstuff's is only 21,958,053 dollars, against 26,051,373 dollars in 1850, and 63,701,921 dollars in 1847, our largest year of export in that department of trade in rice the decrease as compared with last year in the exports is 460,917 dollars, which, with the decrease in the value of tobacco exported makes an aggregate decrease in the second articles of 1,156,751. From these premises the President draws a conclusion that the favourable result anti- cipated by the advocates of free trade from the adoption of that policy has not been realized. The Africa brings 1,42.5,000 dollars in specie on freight. The steam-ship Cherokee arrived at New York on the 29th ult., with advices from San Francisco to the 1st ult., and 2,265,506 dollars in specie on freight. I The news from California is of the most cheering character. The rebels in Mexico have received reinforcements and were about to renew hostilities. The cotton market was firm, with a fair demand. The money market was active. MADAGASCAR. Few persons are aware of the persecution nov ragin,, in the island of Madagascar- The native converts to Chris- tianity are subjected to unheard-of barbarities. Yet in spite of all, the prohibited religion spreads. There is, therefore no fear that Christianity itself will be exterminated. As it was in the times of Roman Paganism, so it is in the present era of Madagascar history; for every Christian martyred, two Heathens are probably made Christians by the resistless moral spectacle of such voluntary self-surrender. But we are bound none the less to sympathize with the accumulated anguish of thousands of individuals, whose goods are seized, whose property is confiscated, whose wives and children are sold into perpetual slavery, whose very lives are sacrificed to the demon of idolatrous tyranny. Madagascar is beyond the pale of civilised nations, and no diplomacy intervenes to abate the furious rigour of her children's fate. In the last out- burst ot this protracted persecution, four persons have been burnt alive; fourteen precipitated from a high rock and crushed to death; a hundred and seventeen persons con- demned to work in chains as long as they live; twenty persons cruelly flogged with rods besides 1,748 other persons mulcted in heavy penalties, reduced into slavery, and com- pelled to buy themselves back, or be deprived of their wives and families. Persons of rank have been degraded, and sent as forced labourers to carry stope fqr Uyejve months together to build houses; and in an endless variety of other ways have the maddened passions of one wicked woman been per mitted now for years past to plunge a large, populous, and beautiful country into misery and ruin.", "word": "4", "description": "\u2026 55 dollars were domestic, and 9,738,695 dollars foreign products.

{"ocr": "EXTRAORDINARY SPECIMENS OF FIRE ARMS. Tlw Timet of Tuesday devote* a long leading article to a description of some newly invented fire arms which are dis- played in the Great Exhibition. We subjoin copious extract,- All visitors of the Great Exhibition must have remarked a kind of oasis in the dcsolste prairie appropriated to the receptioni of the numerous consignments expected from the United Statee. However profound may be the adjacent solitudes, here, at least, a knot of enterprising travellers may always be seen gathered wound a kind of military trophy which is affixed to the northetn side of the nave. This grim display consists of numerous pistols of sufficient dimensions, symmetrically arranged in rows against the wall, or in cases upon a small counter, and constitutes the most important contribution of our Transatlsntic friends to the Exhibition of the Industry of all Nations. 0 a 0 This, in a word, ia the stand of Samuel Colt, the inventor of the six-barrelled revolving pistol, an arm which in all probability will supersede the fire arms at present carried by the cavalry of every military power, and which, by an j extension of the invention, might be made equally appli- cable go the efficiency of the foot service. The weapon is I of the simplest kind, although it is clear enough that a vast | amount of pains most have been bestowed upon the attain- =out; of who- seem a very simple result. Twokindis of pistols have been invented by Mr. Colt-tbe one he terms a bolster,\" the other a belt\" pistol. The weight of the first is 41b. #oz. of \"second 21b. 6ot. The arm in either case consists of a revolving cylinder, containing six charges, and OM barrel. Xvr, as is frequently the case with inven- tions of thitkind, awe the caps which have been fitted ready for use liable to Sail off, or to derangement from other sources. The ysition of tbe cones secures tbe caps in their place*. Agadn. aaotiier objection to arms nf this description has arisen from the uncertainty of aim resulting from the in- terference of the bulge of the cylinder with the line of eight. Tb?e M nothi? of the son here. For the Miwery of each of the ais MeceMive .hot. yon have as = a level through tbe sight as in an ordinal ditelling pistol. the only act the marksman is called upon to perform-wben the weapon is once prepared for use\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdconsists in, raising the hammer to the full cock with the thumb, at in the ordi- nary pistol. He may all the white maintain his. level, and iceep his finger steady to the trigger. Of. the terrible celerity with which fire may be delivered with this arm an idea may be formed from the rerfnlfc of the following trial, which was performed under the eyes of the naval authorities in the United Stites:-A supply of these arms was delivered to eight marines, who in five minutes space discharged with effect no less than 184 buHett. Ewea greater celerity could have been obtained had the men been practised with the weapon: One of the men had discharged thirty bans-the number with which each had been furnisbtd,-&nd was calling for an additional supply before the expiration of the time. It appears to us of the greatest moment, now that we are about to despatch a cavalry regiment upon Guerilla eervice against thc Caffres, that the policy of adopting this weapon should receive the careful but immediate consideratipn of the proper departments. There is no question here of a speculating projector: It has been proved on actual service by the United States' forces during the Mexican war that the efficiency of a body of cavalry is tripled by the use of this weapon. The Ordnance Department of the United States adopted it in use, and ordered a supply of these wea- pone by thousands, even without waiting for a Special vote of Congress. Nor was the decision arrived at by the Ordnance authorities in the United States hasty or premature. We find it stated, morever, in the report of,the Committee on Military Affairs, made during the first session of the last Congress, that the following oflime had reported in decided terms in favour of the adoptiM of these arma :-Hajor- General Taylor; General Twiggs Major-General Quitman; Brigadier-Generals Shields and Pierce; the Inspector. General, Colonel, Crochan; Colonels Harney, Davis, and many other officers whose names it would be superfluous to give at length. It is, however, important to establish that the committee agreed in opinion with the officers named, when they state that one hundred cavalry armed with the repeating pistol would be at least as efficient as three hun- dred armed in the ordinary way. They recommend that all the mounted men belonging to the United States' mili- tary establishment should be supplied with these weapons, They report, finally, that, in their opinion, Colt's repeating pistols are the mOlt\" efficient arm for mounted men and frontier troopi, now known or used.\" As we mentioned abqve, the proper authoritiet have actually acted upon the recommendation. it may appear at first eight a very questionable employ- ment to suggest the adoption of perhaps the most terrible implement of destruction ever delivered into the human hand. We. certainly have no desire to see a Colt's revolver generally worn af the complement of an English gentleman's walking costtime. As a military question it is different. We are bound to take care that our soldiers are supplied with the moct efficient means of destroying any enemy with whom they may be brought into contest. It, wonld be needless to indulge in common-place for the pur- ple of showing that in all cases it is the most merciful course to bring against an enemy the most efficient weapons of offence that the ingenuity of the age may have devised. Better a short than a long war-better one than twenty battles-if war aDd battles there must be. B>e this, however, at ft may, ft It f\\iffitft*nf for the argument to reu it upon the ground of the additional accurity given to our own soldiers by furnishing them with weapons such as these.. Why should not the arm which has secured the safety of the United States' dragoon in Texas, in Florida, in Mexico, be placed in the hands of the English Lancer at the Cape or in Upper India ? In the navy, too, the adoption of the weapon would appear. equally. advisable. In boarding, or at close quarters, the sailor, who heretofore has discharged a single shot and then probably hurled his pistol at the enemy, could with one of these weapons in his hand clear his way with safety to-bitaself. At least it would be an act of sound policy to adopt the use of the weapon in the regiment about to be despatched to the Cape. In conclusion, we would remark upon the practical proof afforded by this invention of the folly of accumulating great stores of weapons in times such as ours, when one invention ia so constantly superseded by another. Our store of carbines and holster pistols will shortly be rejected as lumber, just as the thouaands of old flint mufkete were before them when the percussion principle came into use.", "word": "1", "description": "\u2026 which has secured the safety of the United States' dragoon in Texas, in Florida, in Mexico, be placed in the hands of the English Lancer at the Cape or in Upper India ?

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. I F A N C E. I France has been busy with a new set of appointments. During the recess it requires a committee to take the place of the Assembly in watching over the.safety of the country,and to summon the. Assembly should necessity require it.

A treaty of commerce has been concluded between Greece and Russia, giving to Greece all the advantage of the Russian Hag in Russian ports. The necessities of Greek commerce, and its relations with the ports of the Black Sea, render this measure both politic and \"humane. It is votir(, d to g It is endeavoured to give it a political iticaning-it will undoubtedly draw closer the bonds between Russia and Greece, but its present intent is simply commercial.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. I FRANCE. I An old r.nu vulgar adage declares that seeing is be- lieving. ?; Louis Napoleon, if he never heard this saying, is,nevertheless,acting upon it. That France may more det.erminately believe the actuality of his Presidentship, iie is resolved to exhibit it personally. For this purpose he is goi 1J through the provinces of his Presidency, showing the sweetest of smiles to the most beloved of mayors, prefects, and colonels, and pledging his reso- lution to save the country, to town after town in brim- ming goblets of their own wine. To he sure, the alhir has rather the aspect of theatrical clacquerism. The banquets of the President are somewhat like the clever entertainments got up at pleasant villas on the banks of the Thames for the benefit of the establishment. We are told that men are hired at so much per day, according to the strength of their voices, to groan at the President. A soft voice commands two francs, a loud one from three to five. Htentor, perhaps, might have asked ten. The apptaudin? assemblaes are, it may be, obtained in the same way. Our neighbours are used to this sort of thing, and know better than any nation on earth how to manage it. However this may be, there can be little doubt that the Presidential progress is well judged for the time, and especially adapted to the French provincial taste. All the clap-trap, talk, and show, hels hitherto been oil the revoltit.ionisci-s' The Government can produce more pomp and circumstance, with just as much bravado and declamation. The President, like the So- cialists, can talk of the destinies of France, its high and noble aims, its determination to be in the forefront, and all the other staples of French oratorship. The French have a notion that they have a mission,\" and a presi- dential speech about this same \"mission\" will have a mighty effect. Besides, the provinces are not of late used to magnificent exhibitions, and the novelty will do wonders with them. Altogether the move is, what chess- players would call a strong one. It probably will keep the adverse party quiet for some time, as a player hesi- tates what n do next after a troublesome move. But the game is not over, rfnd as it depends in this instance upon the dice as well as upon skill, we cannot properly judge even where the true advantage lie, WhilsttheFresidentof France is imperialising in the South, the Legitimists are meeting in the North. The real right earnest Simon Pure, at Wiesbaden, declares he will admit of no compromise, and disregards equally the Orleans grandson, and the Napoleon nephew. The little court, consisting of twenty-eight Legitimist deputies, prepares for action, and the Count de Cham- bord (late Duke de Bourdeaux) declares it is high time to assert his claims, and oppose all usurpers, whether of the blood royal or the blood Napoleon. This has its effect in Paris, and the police make war on the arts, seizing 20,000 portraits of the exiled Duke, and capturing copper plates of Louis dix-huit. and Charles dix. The people who so unexpectedly and unanimously made the younger Napoleon President, it is very probable, will think him deserving of a more permanent position. He has done nothing to forfeit their sympathies, whilst hi\" opponents of all kinds have rendered themselves obnoxious to many parties. An outbreak anti-presidential has, however, occurred at Besantjon, of which various versions are afloat. The death of Balzac has caused that public excitement which is ever occasioned in France by the decease of a popular author. AUSTRIA AND ROME. Some angry missives have been interchanged between the Austrian and Papal officials at Turin and Rome respecting the immunities of the Church. Certain proceedings of the Emperor arc alleged to have invaded the rights or compromised the dignity of the Roman See, and are complained of in terms somewhat more terse and strong than ordinarily occur in diplomatic inter- course. As the Roman censured the Austrian deeds, so the Austrian censures the Roman words. Thus the matter stands for the present. I SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN. The war in Schleswig-IIolstein is partially suspended, though operations, offensive and defensive, still continue. The tastes of modern monarchs for mere dominion is greatly modified and not a few have followed the ex- amples of Dioclesian and Charles the Fifth though more with a view to enjoyment than asceticism. The King of Denmark has formed a morganatic marriage with a Lola\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdnot our old friend Montes, but a Mademoiselle Rasmussen, formerly a milliner (and now Baroness Damer); the king intends, it is said, to forego the cares of royalty, when the Schleswig-IIolstein affair is concluded. I ITALY. In Piedmont the disturbances caused by the Jesuits continue, and several refugees have been ordered to quit the Sardinian dominions. Venice is being stripped of its glories by the power of Russian money, the celebrated pictures of the Barbarigo Gallery having been sold for 560,000 francs. I SPAIN. Spain is occupied with financial affairs, there being a new attempt to adjust the public debt. The Queen has appeared in public, with the King, so that the outward decencies have been restored. RUSSIA. The Russian fleet consists, according to official reports, of 168 sail of ships of all sorts and sizes, and are as f(-)Iloivs :-Four line-of-battle ships of 120; six of 100 to 110 twenty-six of 80 to 90 eighteen of 70 to 80 guns; thirty frigates; fifty corvettes, brigs, and schooners; and thirty-four steamers. This naval force is divided into five squadrons the Baltic squadron consists of about 40,000 men, including the artiilery; but the paper states that the C{ew are not of the very best quality of men, and amongst ihern are many Jews from Poland. AMERICA.

Sir George Simpson had returned to Lachine, after having made a tour through the interior of the Hudson's Bay territory, but without hearing anything of the Franklin expedition.

{"ocr": "ROBBERY OF GOLD DUST ON THE SOUTH WESTERN RAILWAY. A few months ago a box of gold worth ZI,300, directed to be sent by the Oriental Company's mail packet Ripon to Alexandria, was stolen in Southampton Docks. The officer of the Ripon who had charge of shipping the specie was sus- pended, and the captain of the Ripon has been obliged to pay the money. A short time since the Oriental Company re- ceived an anonymous letter from Southampton, in which it was stated that the writer had dreamt how the box of gold could he recovered, and the means of recovery were pointed out. Every endeavour to effect a communication with the dreamer has hitherto proved fruitless. About the time that the Alexandria box of gold was lost, a box of specie brought by one of the West India Company's steamers was stolen after it was landed at Southampton. This specie turned out to be counterfeit Mexican dollars. A person was detected ex- changing the dollars in Southampton, and was prosecuted there for the robbery of them. The evidence, however, was not technically complete, and he was acquitted. On Thursday last, the West India Company's steamer Great Western arrived at Southampton with specie, bullion, and gold dust from Mexico, California and the West Indies, worth nearly a million of dollars. The whole of this was despatched to London in four waggons by the luggage train, just before eight o'clock on Thursday night. The waggons were the ordinary open ones, and the only covering they had was tarpaulin, fastened at the sides with cord. Two clerks and two messengers belonging to the West India Company went up by the luggage train in a closed carriage. Their duties were to guard the waggons after they arrived in Lon- don at two o'clock the next morning, and to see the gold and silver safely lodged in the Bank of England. The waggons were roughly weighed before they left Southampton on inursday night, and at six o clocK on Yriday morning pre- parations were made for unloading them. The weight of each of them appeared to be the same, but on examining one of the waggons three boxes, which according to the manifest contained gold dust worth 26,500 dollars, or about \u00c2\u00a3 5,300, were missing. A consultation was held, and an experimen tried as to the practicability of a person getting under the tarpaulin and cord fastenings without cutting them, and it was found that a person could get under and out again in four minutes. There was no doubt therefore entertained that a daring and extensive robbery had been effected. The detective police force was made acquainted with it, and a special train was sent from London to Southampton, warning the station masters and the railway police on the line, of the robbery. At Winchester information was given to the county constabulary and to the city police, and all were on the alert. Just above the Winchester station there is a bridge cross- ing the line on the Stockbridge-road close to the bridge there is a roadside inn named the Jolly Farmer, at the fore door of which there is a path leading down to the rail way fence and to the arch of the bridge. At five o'clock on Friday afternoon, a little cowboy named Turpin was bird-nesting near this spot, and in a thick thorn bush close to the railway arch, he found a box, about a foot long and six inches in height and depth, which he took to his mistress. It was directed to Dunbar and Lous, Limehouse, and was supposed, from its weight, to contain lead or shot. On account of its having been found close to the rail it was taken to Mr Deane, the Winchester station master, and it proved to be one of the missing boxes of gold dust, the value of its contents being 6,500 dollars. Two policemen were immediately or- dered to watch the spot where the box was found, and at 11 o'clock at night an ill-looking fellow, very respectably dressed, with a bag under his arm, was seen to walk down the path from the Jolly Farmer, and when within a dozen yards of the thorn bush he was secured by one of the police- men on watch. He had been walking to and fro on the bridge for hours in the course of the day, and was continually calling at the public house for something to drink. He was had up before the Winchester magistrates on Saturday, and stated his name to be William Pamplin. The third officer of the Great Western was present at the examination, and identified the box as one brought home by that ship. The prisoner was remanded until Friday next. From the situa- tion of the box when it was found it is believed that it was not thrown there from the waggon, but must have been de- liberately placed there. Winchester is the second station from Southampton, and it is quite dark when the luggage train arrives there. This robbery will, there is no doubt, lead to an important alteration in the mode of conveying gold and silver to and from Southampton. At present it is conveyed from South- ampton in the night by slow trains, each of which is often- times a mile long, which are without any effectual guard, and the covering of the waggons can be cut open with a Den- knife. Up to one o'clock on Sunday afternoon no discovery of the two boxes containing gold dust, worth E4,000, was made at Winchester. The whole of the margin of the South Western Railway between Southampton and London has been carefully searched. As soon as the discovery of the box by the cowboy was made, the fact was communicated to London by telegraph, and Inspector Field, the most accomplished detective police officer in the kingdom, left the metropolis for Winchester. Just as he arrived there, Pamplin was brought into the rail- way station, and charged with being concerned in the rob- bery. The prisoner was not known to the police. His story is that he is a tailor by trade, and that having quarrelled with his wife he left London for the country in search of work.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMAEY. The most cxciting foreign news of the pas; week is that received by the American Steamer, relatiie to the invasion of Cuba by the buceancers of the United States. It appears that Lopez had landed at Matanzas, and the government being well prepared to receive him; fifty of the invaders, including about forty Americans, were de, tached from the main force, and captured by a Spanish war steamer, at the Key Levesas, and being tried by court martial, were, on the following day, shot to death. The enthusiasm in the United States, in reference to the Cuba affair, was tremendous. At New York, a iyreat mass meeting had been held, mobs had paraded the streets with banners, hearing the inscription, The blood of Fifty Americans cries for Vengeance And new ex- peditions were concerted, prepared, and despatched. It was reported that Lopez had been successful in tvo en- gagements at Marsel, and that he was joined hy large parties of the people of the country, but this is question- able, and on the other hand it was said that he had re- ceived a severe wound and was taken prisoner, and that the feelings of the inhabitants ,eneraIly was agains: him. It seems, however, quite clear that the Yankees have de- termined upon annexing Cuba as they did ew Mexico, and that however much the United States government affect to condemn the proceedings, it is incapable and unwilling to restrain the incursions of its people. It is sensitively alive to any accidental insult to its Rag '.n the Ilavannah, but makes no effort beyond that of proclama- tion to prevent the invasion. Meanwhile the Spanish government will deal summarily with the pirates who may fall into their hands, and should the America a go- vernment kick at this and interfere, England, Franc:, and the other great maritime powers, will come down inon it and defend the rights of Spain. Arrangements were being made by Mr. Yanderhlt, oj New York, to establish a line of steam communication from San Francisco, by the way of Nicaragua, to Liver- pool. The arrest of a fugitive slave at Poughkeepsie had again created much excitement, although there was no disturbance of the peace. A tremendous fire had occur- red at Concord, supposed to be the work of an incendiary. Property to the amount of 150,000 dolls, was destroyed. The safe of the Mechanics' Bank was among the ruins, containing 1 oO,000 dolls, in bank bills, 10,000 dolls, in specie, and 106,000 dolls, in railway bonds. Late advices from Hayti mention the departuro of the Emperor for the north, with hostile intent, as was sup- posed. The English and French consuls had given public notice that they would blockade every port in the island in case the Haytians commenced hostilities against the Dominicans. There was a serious earthquake throughout Naples on the 14th ult. From the Prineipa to Ulteriore was severely visited, particularly in the distrids ofCarhonara, Laccdotiia, C'alitri, and Montevcrde. In the latter place a lady, Donna Berenice Bonito, was buried under the ruins of a house, while giving the breast to her infant. At liovino, Ascoli, Lucera, and Sanseverina and other place of Capitanata, most of the houses were seriously injured, but no lives were lost. In the province of liari the town of Canosa has suffered most 37(j houses are in a tottering condition; two churches, the town house, and the arch of Diomedes have been considerably damaged. But the ?courge wa most severely felt in the proviDee of Basili- cata, its effects being chiefly concentrated around the Yul- tore, where the motion Instcd ixtv seconds and, according to the account, it had not quite ceased by the last advices. One half of Yenosa has been destroyed; at llionero 02 dead bodies had been dug out of the ruins on the Wtb. At Ban1c the nUlJIher of dead amounts to 100, and the town of Melfi, containing 10,000 inhabitants, is a heap of ruins 700 persons lost their lives there, and upwards of 2UO are severely bruised and wounded. The pretensions of the Priice (le Joiiiville, the naval hero who was to thrash England, but now seeks protec- tion on her shores, to the Presidentship of France, are very little spoken of. There have been some politi- cal arrests. Of I-, ti persons apprehended, 1,jO are Ger- mans. The dissolution of the Belgian Senate causes some uneasiness lest it should lead to troubles in that countrv, and tend to complicate the dangers of 18,j2. Madrid journals of the :!l'(l contain an account of the christening of the infant child of the Duke and Duchess de Montpcnsicr in the palace at Seville wjth great 10mp, The Cardinal Archbishop of Seville officiated.

Martinique papers bring accounts of' a frightful erup- lion of ti1C long-dormant volcano of the Pelee Mountain in that island, which took place on the 5th of August. The occurrence was preceded by a noise like thunder, with a great vibration of the earth. The sugar crop of St. Lucia was nearly closed, and there was a surplus of 1,100 hhds. over last year. From Demerara we learn that the weather, though unsettled, had been favourable to sugar making. The health of the Colony was tolerably good. Several changes had taken place in the Turkish Minis- try. The Capitan Pacha (Soliman Pacha) had been replaced by Mehemet Ali, the brother-in-law of the Sul- tan, and formerly Minister of War. The Minister of Finance had been also removed, and replaced by Nazif Pacha, who had before filled that post, and whose bad management had led to an inquiry which is not yet com- pleted. The Ministry of the Wakoufs (estates belonging to the Mosques) has been given to Hali Effendi, and Soliman Pacha has been named a member of the Grand Council. It is said that the bad management of the Finance Department had led to these changes. The question of the Hungarian refugees is at length settled. On the 1st of September the refugees at Kintahia were to leave that place for J cumelk, in the Gulf of Mace- donia, where they were to embark on board a Turkish steamer, which was to convey them to the Dardanelles, where the American steam-frigate the Mississippi awaited their arrival.

{"ocr": "The Siamese look on all prosperity as the reward of previous virtue, and adversity as the punishment of some particular sin. A system like this would cbss the discoverers of gold in California as men 01 extraordinary sanctity, and those, if any, who have made fortunes by its auriferous soil as little inferior to angels. If this be so, we cannot help wishing that some of the angels had stayed to improve the region where they made their fortunes, and had endeavoured to Christianise a country which, owing to their care. lessness, threatens soon to become little better than Newgate, or the bagnes of Toulon. It is often the way, that people only care about getting rich, not in any way regarding the interest of their fellows, or benefit of the country whence their wealth isdetived. We need not go to the New World for an instance of this; for taking the case of the Iron Works in South Wales, we need only ask ourselves whether or no the great manufacturers of that district have done their duty to their workmen; or whether or no, having filled their coffers with coin, they have left the producers of such coin to their own caprices, and to degenerate further and further into vice. This unfortunate rule has been systematised in California, where everybody is at the diggings, and Christianity is forgotten or despised, and where J ndge Lynch holds his uncertain court, or in the absence of his lordship, in the cause which is daily tried of Right v. Might, the defendant is always the victor.

Such advice was the more necessary in this neighbourhood, as we knew that many persons, both from Wales and Liverpool, had already started, and many more are going, we fear, to start on the western road. The emigrants are urged by two motives, those of superstition, and those of avarice. We shall address ourselves strongly to each of these classes; for it is difficult to say which motive, superstition or avarice, has had more weight on the dupes. With respect to the inhabitants of the Principality, the former has most weight. Such we would ask, whether they can reconcile with common sense the idea of going on a wild goose chase to the Great Salt Lake City, where they may he enrolled as faithful believers in Joe Smith? It is little creditable to the intelligence of the nineteenth century that such a strange delusion as that of the Mormonites should be tolerated-\u00c3\ufffdat people should believe in the Divine mission of an ignorant clown, who never could write his own language, and whose apostle, Sidney Rigton, does not rank much higher in the scale of civilization than adull Machiavclli. Yet in spite of this the Latter Day Saints are increasing, and drawing converts from all parts of tlw country, eSlwciillly srom the Principali- ty. We begin strongly to suspect, however, that many of our countrymen have started as Saints with a terrestrial rather than a spiritual intention. We all know,and the would-be Saints know, that the Great Salt Lake City is on the further side of the Rocky Mountains. They are aware that the Sierra Nevada range alone divides that Holy City from the land of promise, California; and it is our belief that many have enrolled themselves as Latter Day Saints in order to get out to the diggings at the expense of the \"elect.\" It is not for us to warn the real Saints against such pretended converts and conversion. We shall rather endeavour to convince such converts that if anything be more absurd than their conversion, it is the inducements leading thereto. Here may commence our combat with the avari- cious motives by which the multitude is actuated. We doubt whether the Mississippi, South Sea, or Railway manias have produced more misery to the world than the gold mania in California. Midas died of gold. His Californian imitators do so also. We have never yet heard of person who has retired rich from California. Why so, it will be asked? Be- cause it is a rule of political economy that the imme- diate labourers shall but contribute in the first place to the gain of the employer of the labourers. But what is the life of a Californian labourer or digger ? The following gives some idea of it \"I was at the mines, about the 1st July. I think it is far the most oppressive climate I ever was in. It is far more uncomfortable than the climate of Brazil at the warmest season of the year; and everything was literally parched up after a drought, which had then continued for nearly three mouths, ami which had fivo months more to run to the rainy seaf30n.I' What class of people then should see California ? is a question to he answered aftN a response to the interrogatory, What class of people should not seek it ? A well known character dissuaded a young friend from becoming an usher in a school, because he could nut lie four in a bed\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdcould not be bullied by the master's wife-could not be answerable for all the boys' vices and all their faults\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdcould not be up at four a.m. on a cold winter morning\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdcould not lead the life of a slave, of a victim, of a dog. The reply to the above question, therefore, need not occupy much space. Suffice it to say, that no one lio has a respectable station in the world, no one who has been accustomed to civilized life, no one who has a wife, parents, children, or friends, ought to go to Monterey or San Dipgo. Hence will follow the corollary, that those who feel inclined to enter into desperate undertakings\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwho can sustain a hanl life-tolerate a bad lodging-pay monstrous prices for necessaries-endure the abandonment of luxuries for the difficulties certain to be encountered in so wide a field of competition-such are the proper emigrants to Upper California. If any of our readers go to St. Francisco after this, they go with their eyes open. Safer and better fields of enterprise are open for them in the Spanish American States.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY. Since our last the French President has paid a visit to Cherbourg, reviewing the national guards at the various places on his way and being every where re- ceived with great enthusiasm. After inspecting the fleet at Cherbourg, where there was a sham fight, the vessels being at anchor, he returned via St. Loo, Gran- ville, and Rouen. A grand dinner was given after the inspection to the chief officers of the squadron, who were also joined by Admirals Napier, Cochrane, and Lyons, and several other English officers. The president's toast, To the French fleet,\" was greatly applauded. The Moniteur publishes a decree of the the President, conferring the decoration of the Legion of Honour on 73 officers and non-commissioned officers of the army on active service. A quantity of papers written in cipher, and said to detail certain plans of the French refugees, have been seized in Paris. Several warrants of arrest have been accordingly issued. General Count Monthein, ex-peer of France, and formerly Chief of the Staff of the Grand Army, died in Paris on Saturday, at an advanced age. Accounts from Montpellier state that an extensive manufactory of gunpowder for insurrectionary purposes has been discovered in that town in consequence of an accidental explosion on the premises. The proprietor has hpen arrested. The decisions of 61 councils-general on the revision of the Constitution are now known. Of these, 44 have declared in its favour, 7 have pronounced against, and 10 have refused to entertain the question. Madrid papers of the 4th inst state that the retens of elections in the provinces continued to be entirely favourable to the government. It was calculated by the government party that not more than a dozen members of the opposition would be re-elected. M. Mon, formerly Minister of Finance, had been elected at Cadiz by a large majority, and it was expected that he would be elected in one or two other places also. By the steamer Niagara, which arrived in the Mersey on Monday, we have New York and Halifax advices to the 31st. At Washington, the only political news of any importance is the passage of the Fugitive Slaves' Bill, and the continuation of the warm discussion upon the Civic and Diplomatic Appropriation Bill. The recent elections throughout the country were de- cidedly favourable to the Whig party the effect of a decidedly Whig Administration beginning already to tell upon the mass of the people; and Fillmore's policy being, moreover, generally approved. Doctor Webster was hanged on the 30th u It., at Boston, for the murder of Dr. Parkman. A very destructive fire had taken place at Montreal, consuming property to the amount of 500,000 dollars. In Mexico..tbe cholera had nefrrly ocased, but the deaths by its previous ravages were no less than 18,000. The Mexican Congress had been regularly installed, and urgent measures set on foot to replenish the treasury and restore the credit of the Government In California, new and rich mines con- tinue to be discovered in seemingly inexhaustible numbers. A revolution-or rather an insurrection, for its result is not known-had broken out in the Ecuador, and General Egaldi had been beaten and forced to retire on Eoard a British vessel for safety; but he had again landed and assumed command 01 a considerable force, with the intent to re-assert his supremacy, with what success is r.ot known. In com- mercial matters, there was increased activity, especially in the cotton market; which was firm. Business, throughout the States, was on the advance. A letter from Vienna states that General Baron Haynau is to be immediately raised to the dignity of Field-Marshal. The Brussels papers express the utmost horror of the outrages committed on the old General, against whom there was nothing known but random and radical charges. The Times gives an authenti- and radical char f ;'?hich it is h oii,n that fou? hundmd cated document, by which it is shown that four humified and sixty-seven capital punishments were Inflicted by the Hungarian insurgents, besides the massacres of the Transylvanian Saxons. It was called the Mat/gar bloody assize. It is much to be feared that the General was notalone culpable, but that the atrocities imputed to to him were wrung from him by the infamous butcheiles of the other side. Under uny circumstances the treat- ment which he received at Barclay and Perkin's brewery was not such as does honour to the English character. Mob law can never be approved in uns country, nor is it likely to be consistent with justly. Large bodies of uneducated and ill-informed people are ever liable to have their judgments misled and their passions aroused by the misrepresentations of the There IS a. tempest in a tea-pot. The Duke of Hesse, Cassel has been squabbling with his people about taxation and the capital has been declared to be in a state of sieze. The trial of sixteen persons accused of political crimes before the Criminal Court of Palermo, has terminated ra the acquittal of thirteen, the condemnation of one to the ealleys, and of two to death. The execution of the judg- ment on these two last has been suspended, and the Court has expressly recommended them to the royal clemency. A telegraphic despatch from Athens, of the 3d instant, in the Kolner Zeitunq, states that Korfio TsLmis, the Mini- Iter of Worship and Public Instruction, had been shot. Algiers Journals of the 5th, have come to hand. The cholera had completely ceased at Bona, and in the circle of Bougiaits intensity had considerably diminished but it was prevailing at BUkra, and in the district comprised between that town and Batna, though hopes were enter- tained that it would soon disappear. The attempts which had been made to naturalise the cotton plant in Algeria appeared certain to be crowned with MtCceM. In the province of Oran the colonists had suffered from drought, and the Minister of War had ordered advances to be made to them in corn and money. A letter of the 8th, from Hamburgh, says: ]From the movements which took place on the 5th, when Gene- ral Willisen placed his troops in new positions, a eei'ioiis affair was expected between the two armies; but all that took place was a little engagement between a Danish corps of cavalry and three battalions, supported by a corps of chasseurs, and a half battery of artillery of Hol- stein. The Danes withdrew behind their entrenchments. To render several military positions unattackable, Gene- ral de Krogh has covered with water large tracts of ground in Schleswig, which intimate more and more his intention to pass the winter in that province. Almost all the islands belonging to Schleswig have been succe,Bi?ely occupied by the Danish troops. Most of the former public functionaries have been replaced by others favour- able to the Danish cause. Schleswig may now be looked on as re-organised on the Administrative system of the other Danish provinces.

Congress, after adjourning on the 5th, had again assembled on the 9th, but no business of moment had been trans- acted. The Secretary of the Treasury's report was daily expected, and it is again mentioned that pro- bably a new loan will be required to meet financial necessities. Several state messages and legislative measures had occupied the journals since the Atlan- tic's departure. Mdlle Lind continued to enjoy re- curring triumphs. On the 9th she appeared at Bal- timore, when the receipts were abotit X3,000 sterling. At San Francisco, on the 20th of October, a horrible steam-boat explosion occurred, by which from 80 to 100 lives were lost. Cholera had also broken out in the city, and was spreading with great rapidity. Fire had destroyed the city hospital on the 31st of October, but all the inmates were saved. Troops were con- stantly arriving at the Havannah. All was quiet.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Between the States and the Pacific coast, much rain had fallen, and the roads were in a terrible condition. On the 26th of Sept., the Hawaiian Princes were received at the court at Valparaiso, with lr. Judd. The expected extra session of Congress had not taken place. The Finance Minister had visited Valpariso, and a permission to bond sugar in that port had been granted. Don Vincente Perez had been named, by a decree of the 11th of October, agent for the coloniza- tion of Valdivia, and was about to take up his resi- dence there, to afford assistance to emigrants, a great many of whom were expected from Germany and from various parts of Europe. A company had been formed in Valparaiso, to whom the Chilian Govern- ment had granted a contract for the settlement and cultivation of the island of Juan Fernandez, with the exclusive privilege of occupying it for a specified term of years. Accounts trom Bolivia state that General Belzu was progressing favourably. A permanent court-martial was sitting, from whose sentence there was no appeal. Colon?l Laguna, President of the Senate, has been found guilty, as an accomphce in the attempted assas- I siuation, and was shot on the 19th of September.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Seven deputies, leaders of the Opposition, had been ,r td, and it was feared would be condemned to the s,me fate by the same court. Arrests and sen- tences of banishment were matters of daily occurrence, but the principal conspirators were supposed to be lying concealed at Sucre, with the exception of :\\10- rales and Lopez, who it was thought had crossed the frontier at Tnrija. Reports had been circulated that General Ballivian had made his appearance on the southern frontier at the head of 1,000 men, but nothing certain is known. The Gomer Polski announces that the affair of the Hungarian refugees has been finally tri-iinged-Ame- rica has offered them an asylum which they have ac- cepted, and has undertaken to provide for their wants; the Ottoman Government pays their expenses to Li: verpool, and the English Government their expenses from thence to America. This arrangement was pro- posed by the Ottoman Government, and acceded to by England and America. Arista was the elected President of Mexico. No further arrangement has been made in regard to the internal debt. A Bill has passed through both Houses of the Legislature permitting the introduction of fo- reign corn (maize) on the payment of a certain duty, into the ports of Tampico and Matainoras.

General Joaquin Rea was assassinated on the 29th of October at Ayutla. He was attacked by a mob of over 300 men, from whom he received three musket balls and many wounds by hatchets. A private letter from Rio states that war between Rio Janeiro and Buenos Ayres will take place to a certainty. Jamaica advices of the 1st inst. state that the cholera was then more severe in other parts of the island than at that port. Five thousand deaths had occurred at Kingston. Among medical men deceased were Drs. Bailey, Murcott, Tubois, Tait, and Mr. Fadgen. The cholera had made its appearance inBarbadoes amongst the troops stationed in that island, but was considered by the medical men to be sporadic, not unusual in the tropics. The Board of Health had, however, taken the necessary steps to insure cleanliness, &c. by which means it is hoped that the island may be lightly passed over. The weather is remarkably fine, some re- freshing showers having fallen. Two severe shocks of earthquake were experienced in Antigua on the morn- ing of the 2d November. Hain was much wanted in several localities, whilst in others there had been suf- ficient. The Legislature met on the 19th of November. The Lord High Commissioner oftbe Ionian Islands was compelled to prorogue the House of Representa- tives, in order to prevent the adoption of a seditious decree, signed by eleven members, professing their attachment to the Greek government and the desire of the Ionian Islands to recover their independence and be united to Greece. The Senate of Piedmont, in its sitting of the 16th, passed the bill abolishing the laws on primogeniture, by a majority of 31 votes to 19. A telegraphic despatch from Vienna states that the troops of the Seraskier have entered Tezla. The city of Mostar was treating with the Seraskier. The German journals are filled with the most con- tradictory conjectures relative to the attitude that will be assumed respectively by Austria and Prussia at the Conferences, which were to have opened (23d) at Dresden. Apartments had been prepared in the Royal Palace for Prince Schwarzenburg and Baron Manteuffel, who will attend in person. It is scarcely to be presumed that any decisions will be taken until after the Christmas holidays. Accounts from Hamburg state that the Danes have thrown a bridge over the Sclilei, at Capello, west of Missunde, which is being strongly entrenched.

This he has done on the strength of the alliance formed with Austria and Bavaria at the Bregenz Congress. There has been a hostile collision between the Bavarian and Prussian troops in Hesse Cassel.

The gloomiest apprehensions are justified by the present position of affairs, and with the immense forces already in the field on both sides, the conflict, if precipitated will be as deadly and desperate as any one of the mE- morable stni\u00c2\u00a1;gls between the same powers in the last centur ]?iffer?nt versions 0; the colhsion be- tween the ?r?$Slan and federal troop< are given bv the Austrian papers. The Austrian accounts sa 1\" the allied troops were merely reconn oitering the giou,, d, and the cavalry advanced guard had their arms at rest, and that the Prussians fired upon them witout a parley, killing one and wounding five, upon which a fire was opened upon Dronzell. A Bavarian regiment attacked it from the right, and the Prussians retreated with their killed and wounded. The town was then occupied with the federal troops. The Prussians state that the federal troops advanced with drawn swords, and refused to halt, although warned twice distinctly and when they advanced to within 300 yards cf the Prussian outposts, they were fired upon, and several Bavarians were wounded, and three regiments retreated in the dirertion in which they had come. No further hostilities had taken place. Despatches have been sent to the French envoys at Berlin, Vienna, Munich, Dres. den, Baden, Darmstadt, &c., instructing them o otf,, at once their good efforts to prevent a commencement of hostilities which would not fail to compromi\\e the 'a,, of Europe, France offers her media,on with that o?Ergl land to settle the German question.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY. I The Foreign news of the week has not been of ma- terial importance. The National Assembly of France has been pro- rogued, and the President of the Republic, having given a series of banquets to the officers and subalterns of the army, left Paris on Monday morning, by the Lyons railroad, to visit some of the southern provinces. He has everywhere been received with great enthusi- asm, chiefly from his free distribution of largesse, and the respect borne to the memory of the late Emperor by those of his old soldiery who survive. The Moun- tain party, though dismissed for the present from their legislative labours, do not cease to regard with a jeal- ous eye the proceedings of the Government. So ap- prehensive are they of the imminency of a coup d'etat on the part of Louis Napoleon, with the view of trans- ferring the Presidential chair into an Imperial throne, that a Committee of Observation, consisting of seventy of their number, to be relieved at intervals, has been left in the capital for the purpose of watching the movement of the Cabinet during the recess, and re- porting progress to their confreres in the Departments. The session of the Assembly was characteristically wound up by a duel in the Hois de Boulogne on Sun- day morning between two representatives. The latest news announced the arrival of the President at Dijon. The Legitimists were in consternation, the Emperor of Russia having, it was said, pronounced against the Bourbons and in favour of Louis r; apoleon. uiner- ences have arisen between the President and General Changamier. The Council of State has decided that the Standish Gallery and the Spanish Museum, in the Louvre, are the personal property of the ex-King Louis Philippe. The British and North American steam-ship Ame- rica, arrived at Liverpool on Tuesday morning, having sailed from New Yor on the 31st ult. She called at Halifax to land and receive passengers on the 2d inst. Her news is four days later than that received per the Atlantic. Garibaldi, the Roman exile, had arrived at New York, where he has met a very gratifying recep- tion. The Compromise or Slavery Bill had been de- feated in the Senate. The admission of California into the Union was to be made a separate measure. The President had held the usual official attendance, and declared as his policy strict neutrality in the affairs of all nations. A bill has been reported by the House, establishing a line of steam-ships between the United States and Africa. The Hon. Robert C. Winthrop has been appointed by the Executive of Massachusetts to the place in the United States' Senate vacated by the appointment of Daniel Webster to a seat in the Ca- binet. Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer had arrived in New York from Washington, and went immediately to 8taten Island, where he has taken a cottage for t?e ?? ta?!? ? summer. It is said that the health ot bir tienry nvA been impaired by the climate of Washington. The ex-President of Venezuela, General Pacz, had arrived in Philadelphia from St. Thomas. The Texans hafc laid claim to a portion of territory held by Santa fe. The cholera was prevailing in Mexico to a fearful ex- tent. Several fatal cases had occurred at Vera Crua. At San Louis Potosi 300 persons had died out of a t?* pulation of 25,000, and some of the smaller mining dis- tricts were almost depopulated. In the city ofexioo the pestilence was raging with fatal seventy. In the state of Oajaca there has been an attempt at rebellion. The total estimated expenditure of the Canadas, for the year, is L611,394 Os. 10d.; the revenue, \u00c2\u00a3 628,38Q\u00c2\u00bb A telegraphic commnication from Trieste, announcU the arrival of the Indian mail, but the news is nuilt- portant. The Danish army appears to be preparing for an ad- vance into Holstein, although no very important en- gagement has taken place since the battle of Idsdetd. At the date of the lost advices it had occupied Frade- rickstadt and Husum, which had induced some ik&M mishing with the troops of the Duchies, but had not resulted in a general engagement. The immediate ad- vance of the Danes was, probably, indjeed by an ex- aggerated estimate of an explosion, lamentable Indeed in its results to individuals, but unimportant in a mili- tary point of view, which occurred in a laboratory of shells and rockets in the heart of Rendsburg, on,40 7th instant. The origin of the explosion has not been ascertained; but its consequences could ownpply -bo siipjposed todfcet thelonal issue of the contest, did the .f ..0( ,\u00c3\u00a9 \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2\u00e2\ufffd\u00a0-3 i Ho!stein forces really possess on other grounds any fair prospect of success. General Willisen still speaks hopefully, but it would seem only with the design of securing better terms for the Duchies, in a contest which all things go to prove must now be settled by diplomacy. The following is General WiUisen's official report of his recent affair with the Danes After forcing a detachment of our troops on the 7th instant, in the afternoon, which had been sent on the ad- vance, near Friedrichstadt, the enemy attacked yesterday the whole line of our posts on the Sorgbruck near Sorgbruck, and the passage over the river, between Stendler-Munle and the Bissenlake. and showed himself in force in columns of all arms. Whilst he continued himself principally in skirmishing with his light troops and cannon, with our weak patrols of cavalry and Jagers near Sorgbruck, he undertook a more serious attack on the easterly part of oar position. The 2d Jagers per- mitted the enemy to advance close upon them, and as soon as he commenced a more earnest affair the 2d Jagers, having been reinforced by the 3d Sager corps, made a combined charge upon this advancing fore with the bay- onet, when it hastily retired by way of the heights of Tangenberg, in a northerly direction upon Ahlefeld, and our troops baited. The enemy appeared to have had a force of from nine to twelve battalions with him, some artillery and cavalry also, in this reconnaisance, Of this force, between five and six battalions appeared in action. \"Near Sorgbruck the enemy lost only a few wounded men; near Stendler-Muhle he had ten killed and eight wounded, of whom some fell into our hands prisoners. One ofifcer of high rank was said to have been seen fall- ing by our men. The total loss of the enemy, on the whole, in the affair, has been considerable. According to some eye-witnesses, they were seen carrying about 99 wounded men away, so that the loss must have been about 100 men. On our part we have to regret two men killed, and about eighteen wounded, and among the latter one officer, Lieutenant Grund, of the 10th battalion, but slightly. I was an eye-witness myself of this action, and was rejoiced to remark that the occui-rence (Unfall) of Idstedt had rather fired the soldiers with increased energy than otherwise. The combined attack of the 2nd and Srd Jager corps is worthy of imitation, as it was equally crowned with success. Inasmuch, t h ere fore, ? the enemy may have had the in:;hfo:fo:; sa:gnfrh\u00c3\u00a9o;uJ possessing the same, such intention has thus been frus- trated entirely.

In snch a contest the odds are greatly in favour of a single player aqainst some seven hnndred, who must discuss every move before they nvike it. The Presidential message was itnmedsately followed hy the announcement of the Ministry of Transition.\" It is composed of men in good repute for administrative ability, but unknown as politicians or statesmen. So long as such a Cabinet exists, the President is the responsible executive, and Ministers are merely his secretaries. 1 his accords with the theory and practice of the United States constitution, and it is allowed by the letter of the French consti- tution but it is at variance with the practice of France under the existing regime as well as under illI preceding governments since the first Revolution, The formation of an extra-Parliamentary Cabinet was met at first by vehement denunciations in the Assem- bly and the Parisian press. Oil liovv- Tranchere gave notice that he intended to put some questions to the new Ministers on Monday: the chal- lenge was at once accepted, and the majority bragged of what thev were to do. But the reflections of the intervening day of rest sobered the assailants, and Monday, :nstead of presenting the spectacle of a Cabinet baited by the allied forces of the majority, exhibited only M. Hcvyn Tranchere, asking minis- ters in respectful and guarded language, what wer\u00c2\u00b0 their intentions the Minister of Justice replying in conciliating but firm phrase; M. Mathien de la DramA firing upon the Orleanists and Legitimists as deserters from the camp and the President of the Assetnbsy precipitating the close of the discussion with the connivance of the wnole Assembly except the Mountain. Louis Napoleon, thus left master of | the field, is understood to be bent on teahsiug tbe fruits of victory. It is con;ident!_y stated thai the new Minister of Finance will present a dotation bill in the csurse of next week and extensive cnanges in the appointment of Prefects are said to be contem- plated Put in persons devoted to Louis Napoleon. Th\u00c2\u00ab French public appear stili to side with the President. Several members ol tne Asse.nb.y who voted in the majority have received peremptory re- bukes from their constituents and the quotahonsat the Bourse, which receded slight y aftei the presen- tation of the message, rallied again in the beginning of the week, and have continued to advance. The Conference at Dresden makes no progress, It waits for the reports of its sub-committees and they, like true Germans, have commenced their operations on so large a scale that the time ot their completion denes conjecture. The Austrian and Prussian forces have cicssed the Elbe on their route to Holstein. The Hamburg Senate remonstrated, with some nalvete, against their peaceable town be; saddled with a garrison but Prince Scinvarzenberg's answer was peremptory\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdstrategetical considerations ren- dered the occupation of Hamburgh At Vienna, the semi-Liberal Minister of Justice. Schmerling, has resigned, ?.r.d his resignation has been accepted. At Berlin, the Constitutional lea ders hive celebrated the birthday of Frederick the Great, as a set-off against the King's celebration of I the anniversary of the Monarchy. The Congress of the Zoll-Verein is on the eve- of being opened at Wiesbaden all the states belonging to it sand pleni- 4 potentiaries. At Vienna, the Government sum- moned a congress of merchants and manufacturers to deliberate on the new tariff. Fourteen members re- signed on the first day, learning that all the princi- ples of the tariff were to be assumed as nxed but they have since resumed their seats. Prussia has agreed to recommend the incorporation of the Stener- Verein (the rival union formed by Hanover and the other northern maritime states of Germany) with the Zoll-Verein, on the basis of the tariff of the former. The Piedmontese Chamber of Deputies has adopted a treaty with France of commerce and navigation, and a treaty concerning literary property, both hI; large majorities. It has also maintained i:s attitude of opposition to the Romish Court, by passing a bill imposing a tax on property held in mortmain, Several French regiments have been withdrawn from Rome. Some representations made by the Roman to the Austrian Government respecting the excessive j number of troops stationed in Romagna by the latter, and the mode of their distribution have elicited the curt reply, that the military occupation of that terri- tory on the present footing is indispensable to tne Italian interests of Austria. The new Spanish Ministers havr: at the outset a less numerous onposition arrayed against them than! their predecessors. In the Senate, the leading Mode- tates and Prooressistas have \\vithdiawn tneir amend- ments to the Ministerial demand for authority to levy the estimates. Murillo, the President of the Council, has intimated that measures for promoting intercourse between Spain and Mexico are under the considera- tion of Government. S-iain like England and Sar- dinia, is at odds with the Romish Government. The concordat, all 'nut concluded, exacts so large a sum from tlie purchasers of Church property, that Minis- ters are afraid to present it to the Cortes, and will ie. tuin it to Rome for revision. An insurrection broke out at Interlaken, in the ter- 1'itory of Berne, on the 20th of January. The chief magistrate of the town was dangerously wounded; but the insurgents Were defeated, and the Bernese troops have occupied the surrounding passes. The origin and nature of the disturbance is not explained. Con- temporary with this incident renewed apprehensions ofrevoltit' of revolutionary plots are manifested by several es- have been governments. A conspiracy is a leged to have been detected at Vienna, to which a clue ha 1 been given by papers found at Casssel. In Pans the members of a secret society have been arrested, but, with tne exception of five'Vain set at liberty.

But now the mystery has been cx- is plored and the blessing read. And bow truly it is a b e sing, need be told to none who in fancy can look ibro.,d upon the world of waters and behold them lighted up by \"be sails of countless myriads of ships, wafting from shore t, shore the energies of man and the produce ol nature. 1. w, without that ever-open sea, could the work \"f emigratio 1 go on, or old countries be relieved of their portentious swarms How could nations, choking in their own seats, ever fight their way through nations to the I wildernesses and free places of earth Look at the confi- guration of the old world. Its continents are massed together, to facilitate the diffusion of early mankind. 111-tce one limb of the compass in Cashmere, and the other will describe its circle through the northern capes of Asia and Europe, the western parts of our own islands, Cape V crJ\", Cape of Good Hope, rctornin- northwards through the Peninsula of Kamtschatka. Europe fits like a quadrant into Africa and Asia. The Old World would be a circle, but that its south-eastern quarter is broken into the thou- sand islands of Austlralasia. Yet circular though its treneral configuration be. see how the ocean everywhere interlaces with the land, forming an endless extent of sea- board, and affording to advanced civilization the readiest of all means of intercommunication. Africa is an Island. Bay indented Europe exhibits a hymen ot land and sea; while, through the very centre of the continental masses, the Mediterranean and Red seas all but unite the waters of the Eastern and Western oceans. The small Mediterra- nean and lied seas all but unite the waters of the Eastern and Western oceans. That small Mediterranean sea washes the shores of three continents\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAsu, Africa, and Europe glass themselves in its tranquil waters. It lies like the heart of the Old-World system while the yEgean, the Euxine, and the seas of Azof and the Caspian, stretch in lonnected or connectable links into the very centre of the northern continents. A steamer from St. Petersburg may circumnavigate Europe, and regain the heart of Russia by the Azof and the Don. All these watery bar- riers, it will be seen, are so circumstanced as not to obstruct the early wanderings and diffusion of the human race, yet served the purpose\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdall important in those days of war and strong antipathies\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdof keeping asunder many diverse nations, ot preserving peace by isolation. It was an all-wise Hand that so guarded the nations in their cradle; it was an all-provident Hand that then used for isolation an element which, in subsequent ages and in altered times, was capable of becoinitig the best means of bringing into close union the whole family of man. A si- milar design is evident in the plan of the New World; though, less in extent, its variety is also less. its form is longitudinal; tapering to a waste as it descends from the frozen north, swelling again beneath the torrid zon\", and again tapering to a point on the confines of the Antarctic snows. It thus presents the largest possible extent of sea- coast, as if inviting Europe and Africa on the one side, and Asia on the other, to send thither theirswarms. Hud- son's Bay is a counterpart of the Baltic lies in the same latitudes, and is destined to serve a similar purpose (an outlet for the north) as soon as population has grown thicker around its shores.

In the Isthmus of Panama we find repeated the Isthmus of Suez. The pe- culiar configuration of America, too, by which its dorsal chain ot mighty mountains runs close to the western mar- gin, not only leaves its eastern plains open to Europe from whence its population was to be derived, but affords to its internal provinces the inestimable benefit of ready access to the ocean.

{"ocr": "CUBA. I Few persons who have not actually visited the United States of America can form any accurate idea of the opinion entertained by our transatlantic brethren, either of their own prowess, or the extent of this world's surface, which they believe it their destiny to occupy. In a recent speech by Mr. Gladstone, on the foreign policy of our government, he asserts that no great nation, confident of itself, ever makes a boast of the power it possesses. Mr. Gladstone knows nothing of America. There is no ques- tion that our relations across the water are not only a great nation already, but, as we firmly believe are destined to he the greatest that ever aspired to universal dominion. And yet no people has ever been more conscious of its capacity, or more ready to declare that consciousness before the world. It might have been supposed that the millions of square miles which they already call their own, and which no- where densely peopled, are only yet thoroughly settled on the shores of the Atlantic, would have satisfied the desires of the most ambitious; but, strange as it may appear, the very men who have gone through every difficulty and pri- vation to redeem a tract from the wilderness, will not hesitate without any apparent motive, if anything still more difficult and inaccessible be offered, to abandon the ground which has already cost so much effort for new and untried scenes of exertion. Half a continent already in their hands is too confined a space for their full develop- ment. Not satisfied with illimitable deserts, they are ready to sacrifice every principle which governs civilised nations to include Mexico in their grasp; and nothing but a sense that the attempt would as yet be premature, prevents them extending their arms to the West Indies, and carrying war into Canada. The same unconquerable Anglo-Saxon energy, united with unequalled sagacity aud prudence in the conduct of affairs, ana with the most sin- gular capacity for self-government, which has raised the people of England to their present proud station, is pos- sessed, if possible, in a more intense degree by the Ame- ricans. Thanks to the early care of the governments of the different States, every man is educated, and every man looks upon it as a sort of duty not only to provide for himself and family, but to extend what he conceives to be the privilege of a republican government, but which means in fact the domination of the Yankee race to all the nations of the globe. Every man regards himself as destined to be a pioneer in this cause, and any one more daring than the rest who has conceived a plan of attack, however extravagant, upon a neighbouring country, is sure to find multitudes ready to flock to his standard. We have been led to make these remarks in explanation of what to many of our readers may yet seem almost incre- dible, the expedition from New Orleans, under General Lopez, for the subjugation of the island of Cuba. This magnificent island, the chief of the Spanish West Indies, is situated at the northern entrance of the Gulf of Mexico, at a distance of only sixty miles from the adjoin- ing coast of Florida, one of the United States, from which it is separated by the gulf stream. In length it is equal to Enlana and Scotland united, and is about one-third their average bieadth. It contains more than 30,000 square miles, nearly the whole, with the exception of a few rocky districts, is very fertile land; a range of mountains which runs f it six hundred miles through the whole extent of the island being capable of cultivation to their summits. Of this vast extent, only about three millions of acres are as yet nnder cultivation. Fully twelve millions being either used as grazing lands or still primaeval forest. Thd geological formation of the island is a white volcanic lime- stone, giving everywhere the strongest evidence of its origin. The soil in some parts is a dark clay, but gene- rally a red loam, very productive, but so easily pulverized as in dry seasons to fill the atmosphere with minute par- ticles of dust to such &n extent as to penetrate the clothing, and discolour the skin. The forest still covers a consi- derable portion of the island, and among the indegenous woods are mahogany and several other kinds of great beauty and value. The palm-tree, with its lofty stem and graceful foliage, prevails everywhere; ;he cocoa, the mango, the guava, and other trees bearing tropical fruits, and some attaining almost the size of forest trees, are found growing wild as well as cultivated in the vicinity of the plantations. The productions of the island are chiefly sugar, coffee, and tobacco, of which it would yield enough to supply the whole European demand. Maize, or Inltian corn, is indigenous, and rice is grown in considerable quantities. Coal has been discovered and worked, and the east end of the island is very rich in copper, the mines of which are principally in the hands of British companies, who export several cargoes of the ore each year from the port of Santiago to England. The population which of late years has very rapidly increased, is now supposed to exceed 1,400,000, of whom 600,000 are whites, 200,000 free blacks and mulattos, and the remaining 600,000 slaves. The proportion of free blacks is very large, and would have been much greater but for the great importation of slaves which takes place every year from the coast of Africa. They reside chiefly in the cities, and in Havan- nah, particularly the free coloured population is said to be nearly equal to the slave. The white population consists chiefly of Creoles-i. e. persons born on the island, but there are a great number of purely Spanish familes; and many of the merchants, planters, and traders, are from France, England, and the United States. A military force of not less than 20,000 men is kept up by the mother country at the expense of the island revenue: more than half of these are stationed in Havannah, and the remainder distributed in the other cities. The troops are almost ex- clusively Spanish, the policy of Spain preventing any extensive recruiting among the colonists, and seldom per- mitting any high military rank to be bestowed even on Cuban nobility. The government is an absolute despotism, the captain-general being sent from Spain, and having supreme military command over the whole island. For civil purposes the island is divided into three dis- tricts, the capital of the central division being Puerto Principe, and of the eastern Santiago di Cuba, the gover- nors of which are for these purposes independent of the captain-general. The supreme court, however, has juris- diction over the whole island, and of this the captain- general is ex-officio president. Cuba possesses some of the finest harboura in the world; the coast is generally protected by reefs and rocky islets but the entrances to the principal ports are free from all difficlty, and the harbours themselves capacious and secure. The great city of Havannah is situated on the north side of the island, and on the west of the noble har- bour from which it derives its name. The approach from the sea is very striking, from the rocky heights opposite the city being crowned by the Moro Castle, which is the commencement of a long line of fortifications extending for half a mile down the bay. The gult stream here washes the coast, and the mouth of the haibour near the Moro is only about a thousand feet wide, the opposite side being defended by another strong fortification called La Punta. The flow of the tide in the Gulf of Mexico does not ex- ceed two feet, and the depth of water close under the guns of the castle is always from seven to eight fathoms, more than sufficient for the largest vessels, so that ships of the line may anchor in any part. The entrance, which in some places does not exceed 350 yards in width, continues for about half a mile, after which the harbour expands into a splendid basin, which extends sseveral mile- into the interior, and is covered with the ships of all nations. On the right as you enter, and immediately opposite the long line of fortifications, lies the city, which stretches for about two miles down the bay, and with its suburbs con- tains a population of about 200,000 souls. It is built en- tirely of stone; the houses are of the Spanish style of architecture, presenting a prison-like front to the street, from the windows containing no glass, and being defended by iron bars. There is usually a court-yard in the centre, around which are the apartments. The streets run from the shore, and are crossed by others at right angles. The old city extends about a mile along the harbour, and rather more than half a mile inland. It is surrounded by very strong walls, capable of being mounted with heavy guns, and defended by a ditch and glacis. At a little dis- tance from the walls, the city is entirely surrounded by the suburbs, which far surpass it in extent and population, and contain many of the finest houses, in which the better class of citizens reside. In the city, however, are several very noble residences, one in particular belonging to Joachim Gomez, which is fully equal to the houses of our first nobility, and, which, together with the splendid in- come ef its owner, has arisen entirely from the profits of the slave-trade. The wharfs extend along the shore, with sheds to pro- tect from the intense heat of the sun the busy crowds who are engaged in loading and discharging cargoes. Imme- diately in the rear of this w a beautiful paved square, adorned with fountains and tropical plants, within its en- closure, and Mirroaaded by the palace of the governor and Otheryofafte buildings. Not far distant is the church of San 'Pomingo, with its crowd of beautiful worshiped; and in the rear of the street of San Ignasia, a noble cathedral, containing many fine paintings, and hallowed by the re- mains of the great Columbus, which rest immediately before the altar. There are many streets, containing ex- cellent shops, kept principally by Frenchmen and Italians; great numbers of churches, of which the bells, to the dis- traction of the stranger, are always ringing; many con- vents, now happily diverted from their original purpose to the better one of hospitals or manufactories, ana amongst these is the old palace of the Inquisition. The chief manufactories within the walls are of the celebrated cigars, and of confectionary and preserves, which are here made in great perfection. The streets are macadamised, with- out any side walks or sewers, and invaribly after a shower, of rain they become the bed of a torrent, which threatens to sweep the unwary traveller into the harbour. As hackney-coaches are rare, the writer has not unfrequently, after one ot these tropical storms, had to wait at the door of histhotet for a negro who, for a small silver coin, would carry him on his back to any required distance. For the same reason, the ladies never walk; in fact, during the day, one might imagine that the female sex, except of a very dark colour indeed, did not exist in Ha- vannah. As the sun declines, however, ample amends are made for this temporary concealment. Behind the bars, which defend each spacious window, two rows of chairs or sofas are always placed and occupied by the resident family, the ladies receiving their visitors within, or freely conversing with them as they form a group outside. The streets are also full ot open carriages called valantes, each of which is adorned by at least one senora, in full- dress evening costume, perhaps enriched with jewels, and with no covering for the head and neck but a lace veil. These are on their way to the pascos, or public prome- nades, without the walls of the city, where they continue moving in one eternal round, amidst crowds of cavaliers and well dressed pedestrians, with whom they engage in lively conversation, until their charms aie obscured by the increasing darkness. No religion is tolerated but the Roman Catholic; and before the dissolution of the convents, the city was filled with monks and friars, among whom occasionally appeared the stern garb of the Inquisition. There are still proces- sions at all religious festivals, and at seven every morning the churches are filled with dark-clothed women attending early mass. The inhabitants are gay and hospitable; the Opera and the Tacon Theatre are both well attended. The public buildings, of which those for a charitable pur- pose are the most prominent, are large and handsome. The environs of the Havannah possess their tull share of beauty. The sea beats upon a rocky coast, covered 0. with shells and marine curiosities; and a finely undulating country, richly cultivated, extends from the coast into the interior. Besides the fortifications already mentioned, the heights about the city are crowned on the land side with an impregnable fortress called El Principe. Villas and gardens, particularly on the Cerro road, abound; and the governor's country palace, and the old residence of the bishop, are situated in the midst of grounds and walks decorated with statues and rare shrubs and flowers, which make them a favourite resort of the inhabitants. From the city a railroad, hbout sixty miles in length, runs to the southern part of the island. It passes through a very rich and highly-cultivated country, with well-stocked farms, with fields divided by hedges of aloes and lemon trees, which are as iinpenenetrable as they are beautiful. The lemon or lime trees, when covered with their aromatic white flowers, intermixed with green fruit, give an air of singular richness to the country, resembling some of the best parts of Englaiid. The crops principally observed in the vicinity of Havannah consists ot acre after acre of pine-apples in every stage of growth, some with the first budding leaves, and others with rich golden fruit; then fields of plar.tains, or binanas, with their green stems and vast bunches of fruit covered with huge leaves of the most vivid verdure, a very few of which are sufficient to thatch the huts of the labourers; intermixed with these are fields of maize, and further on, extensive estates covered with sugar-cane, or plantations of ceffee, which form the chief portion of the agricultural riches of the country. The im- perial palm-tree is everywhere to be seen, sometimes standing alone in the fields, or clustered together in small groves, mingled with the cocoa-nut tree, for the shelter of a house or a small spring of water; and at others, and particularly on the coffee estates, arranged in stately avenues, consisting of double and treble rows of trees from sixty to eighty feet in height, without a branch, surmounted with a dome of fan-like leaves, twenty feet in length, which meet each other, forming an archway of it is impossible to exaggerate the grace or splendour. The railway passes through several hamlets to the town of Guines, a favourite resort for invalids from the United States, forty-five miles from Havannah, and is continued thence to the south coast. The district through which it passes is the well- known Vuelta Abajo, which produces almost all the to- bacco from which the finest cigars can be manufactured. Another railroad leaves the eastern side of the harbour of Havannah from a cluster of villages, one of which contains the navy yard, and another the grand amphitheatre, in which the Havanneros delight themselves with bull-fights, and which runs parallel with the coast through a hilly country, abounding with plantations, to the port and town of Matanzas, a distance of about sixty miles. This town is small as compared with Havannah, containing about 30,000 inhabitants, and is situated at the bottom of a noble bay, and in the midst of most enchanting scenery. The se mountain range which traverses the island here approaches the coast, and immediately in the rear of the city the mag- nificent Pau de Matanzas rises to the height of 6,000 or 7,000 feet. Two rivers, the Yumuri and Canimar, empty themselves into the boy the valleys through which they run are of the most extraordinary and picturesque beauty, equaltto the finestjriver scenery of Europe. The Conimar surpasses the Wye, and the view from the hills which com- mand the valley of the Yumuri, discloses a landscape which can hardly be rivalled in Switzerland itself. This part of the island is covered with sugar and coffee planta- tions, most of which are in the hands of French, American, and English owners. Proceeding eastward, and passing a rich district called the Segua, we arrived at the small port of Cardenas, the scene of the outrages of the late expedi- tion. It is an insignificant place, but important from its situation amidst the greatest amount of foreign population. and the finest plantations of the island. Several small towns succeed each other till we arrive at the city of Puerto Principe, the capital of the central district of Cuba, and about 400 miles from Havannah. It contains a popula- tion of 40,000 souls, who are supported principally by the culture of tobabacco and sugar, and the breeding of nume- rous herds of cattle on the adjoining pasturages. South- west of this city, at a distance of about 250 miles, through a very mountainous countnr filled with copper mines, is the town of Santiago di Cub' sit' a ed on the south coast, and the seat of government for the eastern part of the island. Its harbour is almost equal to that of Havan- nah and being situated in the centre of the mining dis- tricts, and amidst immense plantations of sugar, coffee, and tobacco, it carries on a very extensive trade with Europe and the West India islands. There are several other towns on the south coast, but none of distinguished note or that possess anv interest, except for the localities in which they are situated. The general appearance of the island is that of exuber- ant fertility. It is impossible to exaggerate the beauty of the plantations covered with ample crops, and situated in the midst of the most delightful scenery Independently of the palm, the forest trees, partic lar y the ceyba and ma- hogany, attain a prodigous size, and cover every great elevation. The climate is delicious, the great beat of the tropics being tempered by the perpetual ocean breezes, and, in winter, reduced below the average of the acy Jning islands in consequence of its proximity to the coast of the great northern continent. With the exception of the towns upon the coast, which are frequently ravaged by the yellow fever, the island is generally healthful, and is much frequented by invalid's from colder latitudes. Cuba was one of the discoveries of the great Columbus, who visited the harbour of Havannah at the close of the year 1492, but was prevented from ascertaining the fact of its not forming part of the Continent by the fears and mutiny of his crews. It was then filled by a large and ap- parently prosperous community, consisting of several tribes of Indians, all of whom soon disappeared under the savage tyranny of their conquerors. The first captain- general was Velasquez, appointed in 1511, and since then the ever-faithful island,\" as it is always styled is official documents, has proved one of the brightest jewels of the Spanish crown and until lately has not only enriched those who have emigrated to it from Europe, but contri- buted a considerable eurplus revenue to the mother coun- try. The cultivation of the land is carried on chiefly by slave labour, but there is a very considerable white pea- sant population; and it is believed that, but for the con i- nued importation of African slaves, arising from the de- mand created by the vast increase of late years in the number of sugar and coffee plantations, there would be no reason to fear the practicability of an early emancipation. The ex m le of P rto Itii o, in wbi h the number of slaves bl ars a very small proportion to that of the free blacks, sufficiently proves that the general prosperity need not suffer by so plain an act of justice; but so long as the foreign slave-trade is permitted, and even encouraged by the authorities, the annual introduction of so great a number of savages prevents the adv\u00c2\u00abn-e of civilization among the ri' groe and also prevents their form;ng, as they do in Havan- nah, and soon would do throughout the island, a contented and thriving peasantry, to whom all the necessary labour and industry required by the planters might be safely intrusted. This is too large a subject to enter upon within tne limits of this paper; and we must conclude our rapid sketch of the island with a short account of the late Cuban expedition. During the writer's residence in Louisiana, extending to a period now twelve years since, he had many opportunities of observing the earnest desire and determination of the people of the southern and western states to become ultimately mas- ters of this beautiful island. Many of the sugar planters of Louisiana, unsuccessful in consequence of the uncertainty of the climate ol that province, and of the immense cost of the slaves, nearly three times greater than the cost of those of Cuba, have, during the last quarter ot a century, emigrated thither, carrying with them the industry and skill which have already made the district around Matanzas so important and productive. These men, accustomed to unlicensed liberty at home, with the choice of their own rulers, and sufficiently impatient of the restraints of the Spanish government, have never concealed their desire to see their adopted home not so much under the dominion of the American government, as forming one of the states of the great confederacy. The agi- tation of the slavery question, and the necessity so strongly felt of counterbalancing the growing power of the north, by the addition of another slave-holding community, has induced a large portion of the inhabitants of the southern states to sympathise with their exiled brethren. The success of the Mexican invasion, and the termination of the war, which left multitudes of freebooting soldiers without a pursuit, furnished both an excitement to some other incursion, and the means of carrying it into effect. The expedition was for many months in course of preparation on the banks of the Missis- sippi, and the first detachment under General Lopez, a re- fugee from one of the Spanish republics of the continent, sailed on the 7th of May from New Orleans. Lopez himself, with fifty ot his companions, embarked on board the Creole, a small steam-ship, which cleared the port of Chagres, in the isthumus of Panama. On their way down the river, they overtook, evidently by concert, the barque Georgiana, pro- fessedly bound for the same place, and from her they received an addition of five hundred men to their number. The Georgiana was directed to sail to the Isla de las Mugeres, on the coast of Yucatan, where, after cruising about for about ten days, the Creole rejoined her. At this island they met the brig Sarah M'Leod, which had already arrived with one hundred passengers, and, as well as the Georgiana, was laden with military stores. According to the American account, the passengeiajin the three vessels, amounting in number to six or seven hundred, were here first informed of the destina- tion of the expedition, they having hitherto innocently be- lieved that they were intended to cross the isthumus of Pa- nama, en route for the golden shores of California, and that the amunitioll and military stores were necessary for their defence against the Indians in that territory. The reader miy credit as much of this as he pleases at any rate, a council of war seems to have been holden, the result of which was, that one hundred men, with provisions, and the two ships Geirgiana and Sarah M'Leod, were left on the island of Contoy, adjoin- ing the island of Mugeres, adjoining that ot Mugeres, and the Creole, with about about 550 men, sailed for Cardenas. They landed at thar. port on Sunday morning, the 19th of May, to the astonishment and terror of the inhabitants, many of whom seem instantly to have abandoned the town. Lopez having driven out the few soldiers stationed there, liberated the convicts in the prison, and attacked the bouse of the Governor, who, after a slight defence, was compelled to yield. At about six in the evening, the small body of troops, aided by the escaped inhabitants and the people of the vicinity, bravelv attempted, to regain the town, they were, however, defeated by Lopez's band, with a loss of about 150 killed and wounded. The loss of the Americans, who were of course well posted, is said not to have exceeded a third of this number, but among the severely wounded were some of the leading officers. The struggle was suffi- ciently severe to satisfy the intruders that their chances of success were very small; and fearing a renewal of the attack with the aid of a body of troops from the ne ghbouring town of Matanzas, and also finding that the slaves and convicts continued true to their allegiance, Lopez determined to effect a retreat. A rumour of the approach of the Spanish war- steamer Pizarro, hastened his flight, and in clearing the har- bour the Creole got aground, but was released by the loss of all her amunition and stores, which were thrown overboard. They arrived at Key West, on the coast of Florida, on the ensuing morning, and only escaped the Pizarro, which had already reached that harbour, by the shallowness of the channel, by which their light draught ot water enabled them to cross the reef. The vessel was at once taken possession of by the American authorities for violation of the neutrality laws, and Lopez himself escaped to Savannah, where he was arrested and discharged, and subsequently to New Orleans, where he now awaits his trial. 1 he Georgiana and Sarah M'Leod, with the people left on the island of Contoy, were captured and brought into the Havannah. After a short imprisonment, it is understood that, at the request of the American government, they have been released. The expedition has totally and ignominiously failed but it is not the nature of the American people so easily to give up an object which they once covetted, and we have little doubt that similar attempts to the above will be repeated, until some quarrel is fastened upon Spain, which will excuse the employment of the American navy for the same purpose. Neither Cuba nor Spain alone can resist so powerful an oppo- nent, and the only chance of the independence of Cuba will be either the interferance of other European governments, or the emancipation of the slaves, which will render the acqui- sition a useless one.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdFrom the Working Man's Friend.", "word": "4", "description": "\u2026 governs civilised nations to include Mexico in their grasp; and nothing but a sense that the attempt would as yet be premature, prevents them extending their arms to the West Indies, and carrying war into Canada.

A grand ball was given on Friday evening at the British Embassy, by the Marquess and Marchioness of Normanby. The number of invitations issued was upwards of eighteen hundred, and, although the guests present were very little in- ferior to that number, the splendid and spacious saloons were not by any means overcrowded.

The Prince, on his arrival at Cologne, was met by the municipal council. A letter from Vienna ofthe22nd states that the Archduchess Sophia, mother of the Emperor, had left for Trieste, with two physicians, in consequence of the receipt of a telegraphic dis- patch announcing that her son, the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, brother of the Emperor, had fallen dangerously ill.

A grave discussion has broken out between the Federal commissioners and the Danish plenipotentiary, with respect to the amnesty\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe former wishing for an amnesty, which excludes no one the latter wishing to make several exclusions. The matter has been referred to the respective governments. A letter from Vienna, of the 20th, says- The Russian Embassy has received dispatches in which the cabinet of St. Petersburgh insists on a prompt settlement of the question of the Duchies. It appears that the succession to the throne of Denmark, as relates to Oldenburgli, is not yet arranged, as no branch of the Danish dynasty will accept the crown unless the integrity of the monarch is guaranteed. The cabinet of St. Petersburgh persists in demanding an European Congress for a settlement of all disputed German questions but Prince Schwarienberg as strongly opposes the proposition, contending that there is no need tor foreign interference that Germany can settle her own affairs, and at all events Austria will not take part in such a congress. r The Austrian government is reported to have proposed to the Ottoman Porte to interfere in its behalf in Bosnia, but the offer has been declined by Ali Pacha. The Porte has confidence in its own powers to put down the insurrection, as public opi- nion is with it, as upholding equality against privilege According to the news of the 17th, a report is current that an army of 600,000 men is to be concentrated near Frankfort. Austria and Prussia are to contribute 20,000 men each Ba- uria 10,000, and the other States 10,000 among them. The Turkish tro-jp6 are besieging Bihacs, the head-quarters of the insurgents. The fugitive insurgents are not permitted by the Crotian troops to take refuge in the Austrian territory. LEVANT MAJL. We have received by the Levant mail, Athens journals to the 18th, and Constantinople to the 14th. An Athens paper gives a list of bands of brigands now infesting Western Greece. The mosttormidabte are those of Caramba, who is at the head of 12 men Gradoula, with 15 men; Caragounides, with 17 and Balafa, with 19 men besides two more bands of 16 men each, whose chiefs are not known. It appears from all ac. counts that the system of brigandage has spread over the country to a degree hitherto unparalleled. Another paper estimates the total number of public robbers now in Greece at one thou\u00c2\u00bband.

This fis>htme is most severe on our (insurgents') left wing, commanded by Von der Tann. Williseo commands the centre the right wing is under the orders of Von der Horst. The loss on the part of the Danes is already considerable, especially near the morass of Lusbuch, in which the Danish cavalry got embarrassed in the sioking ground. The baggage of the general stuff, which has been left here, has been advanced again northwards. We have just heard that Von der Tann hns broken through the Danish right wing.\" Another telegraphic dispatch, dated Rendsburg, 25th July, io the evening, aays\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Until ten in the morning victory was with the Schleswig- Holsteiners, when the fortune of the day changed. At half-post two in the afternoon, the centre of the Schleswig-Holstein orrny was brokeD through. aDd It retued to Schestadl, one mile nortb of the Elder. II Eight, PM. The Danes have occupied the town of Schleswig, and the batteries of Eckeoforde have been disarmed.\" Two other telegraphic dispatches, one from Hamburgh, the other from Schle\u00c3\u00b8wig, corroborate the above intelligence. They state that the Schleswig-Holsteitigrt retired in good order, but were obliged to evacuate ScMeswjg and Eckernforde. The Dines are stated to have entered Schleswig at half-past eight in the evening. The hend-quarters of the Schleswig Holstein army are at Reoritbuig. The loss, on Doth sides, in officers and men, is considerable. Rendsburg, July 26th. \"The Si hleswig-Holstein army have taken up a concentrated position, 26,000 strong, near Schestadt. Wo have no intelli- geoee respecting Von der Tann's division.\" These tatler dispatches, which proceed from the head-quarters of the insurrectionary forces, leave no doubt of the victoiy of the royal troops. A telegraphic dispatch from Berlin, of the 26th, says :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Yesterday, after a sanguinary batile, which lasted many hours, the Danes gained a decisive victory. The Holsteiners, beaten on all sides, were driven back to the frontier. The Danish head-quarters are in Schleswig. The Holsteiners have evacuated Eckernforde, and disarmed their batteries.\" The news of the defeat of the Holsteiners is confirmed, and the victory of Idstedt appears to have been, on the part of the Danes, even more complete than had been at first supposed. There is but little doubt that ere this Schleswig is completely free from the presence of the Holstein troops, who have fallen back across the Eider; indeed the journals state that the mouths of the Schlei and the Eeider have fallen into the power of the Danes, who have lauded and taken possession of Tonningen and Cappeln. ANOTHER ACCOUNT. \"July 26 h, quarter to three o'clock, P.M. The Schleswig-Holsiein cause i\u00c2\u00bb not in so desperate a pre. dicanseni as there was occasion to believe from the first iotelli. gence. Twenty-five thousand picked troops are concentrated upon Wittensee. Von der Tann his not taken flight, but, on the contrary, is at the head of 16,000 men. The repcrts of a countless number of killed and taken on the part of the Schleawig-Holsteiners have not been confirmed to their full extent. An escort brought the wounded into Ahona at about one o'clock, and were to be speedily followed by the Danish prisoneis. This night, at half-past twelve o'clock, orders wtre given to abandon Eckernforde, and dismantle the fortifications, which was accomplished at fir*. The artiliery arrived at Rendtburg. The Gefion is still in the possession of Prussia, and appears out of danger. Among the Danish prisoners is his Excellency Bag. geson, a person of considerable importance. MALTA. I Letters from Malta of the 22nd ult., state that the cholera was Ilill prevailing there, and though the cases were not quite to numerous, the mortality was as great as ever. The men and women of the 44th Regiment still suffered. The fleet wu still cruising on and off the island, daily com- munications being kept up by boats. The amount of deaths in the fleet was ilmall compared to those on shore, only fourteen having occurred out of more than three hundred cases. The Admiral's third daughter was married on the 18th to Lieutenant Danglars, of the flag-ship. ITALY. The Council-General of Health at Genoa has decided that all arrival. from the Regency of Tunis, Malta, and Algeria, where the cholera at present exists, shall be henceforward subjected, in the Sardian States, to a quarantine of twelve instead of seven days, but without the necessity of landing or purifying goods at the Lazarettoes. Also, that all arrivals from Cuba, now labour- ing under the epidemy of the yellow fever shall be subiected to a fortnight's quarantine, besides landing goods at the Lazarettoes, where they are to be subjected to purification for the space of twenty-one days. A Turin journal quotes a letter from Florence, of the 20th ult., slating that the atraogest rumours are cnrient about the band of 11 Passatore, who still infests toth the Tuscan and Papal Roraagna, notwithstanding the exertions of the Austrian troops. Engagements are said to have takeu place with hit men in the vicinity of Cortena, in which the Austiians were worsted. They also say that 11 Passatore has two pieces of cannon, that he has divided his band into three bodies, and is well provided with arms and money, TURKEY. A letter from Constantinople, of the 9th July, states that M. de Lamartine, and his two companions, NIAI Chempeaut and Chamboran, had been graciously received by the Sultan. The same letter states that the Oituman Porte has notified to the refugees at Shumla, that such of them ae may he willing to emigrate to America will receive passports, and a sum of 1,000 piastres, (about 274 francs,) in aid of their journey, but that those who wish to remain must not expect any more pecuniary assistance from the government. WEST INDIES. Accounts from Havannah of the 11th July, report a few u'es of cholera. Severe rains had fallen. We find that mercantile reports say sugars are very animated, maintaining great firmness in prices. Hayti advices of the 28th nit. report the probability of the invasion of Domiogo as more doubtful. Soulouque professes to desire peace. Coffee was scarce. The iron steam-ship Viceroy, lost off Seal Island, had been abandoned.

The resignation of the former cabinet was not opened and it was believed that no immediate change would t\u00c2\u00abke place. There was little doubt the office of Secretary of State would be offered io Mr. Webster. The funeral of President Taylor was to lake place at Washing- ton on the 13 = h ult.

Nineteen bodies had been discovered amongst the ruins, three persons died in the hospitals, ninety were wounded, and fifteen were missing. Cholera was still very severe in the Western States, especially in Cincinnati and St. Louis, &c. In Mexico its ravages are reported to be immense. Professor Webster's case was still undecided.

The Duke and Duchess of Montpensier were present, and according to the custom which prevail* when any member of the royal family assists at the spectacle, the chief of the Toreadors it- quested their permission to commence the fight on his beaded knee. At this proceeding, the entire assembly hooted and hissed. When the second bull was about to be led forth, the same ceremony was repeated with the same ruult, alihoogh the famous Moates, the conqueror in all his battle,, was one of the Toreadors. Oa the third bull-fight being about to coinn,et)ce, the Toreador merely ululed the Duke and. Ducheat, without bending his knee. A about of applause was Immediately raised by the entire mob. Thus the Duke of Montpensier, whose only fault is his being a foreigner, was three times insulted. The Royal party, visibly affected, quitted their box after the death of the third bull. This manifestation, so spontaneous and so unanimously pro- duced, surprised everybody, even those who took pari in it. It ia regarded as a political event of considerable lmpoitance. Some isolated and insignificant attempts ID favour of the Pre. tender, have been made in the provinces. GERMANY. The German journals publish the reply of the Government 01 Oldenburg, to the propobition of Hanover, lor forming a new Saoderbuod in Northern Germany. This teply consists of a direct refusal; and it says that if the restricted liberal state got up by Prussia has not produced the good effects that had been expected, it is owing to the conduct of Hanover and Saxony. It concludes by saying that the motives which caused the Grand Duke of Oldenburg to join the federal state, still esist, and that those motives are the necessity of forming a strong sanitary or. ganization in Germany, and of realising, even at the expense of ucnfices, the promises made to the people. PRUSSIA. The Berlin papers contain brief noiices of the expulsion cf M. Bunssn from the House of Lords by Lord Brougham, but add no remarks of their own on the occurrence. The Crimioal Court had begun to enforce the sentence of im. prisonment on political offenders immediately on its being pro- nounced, contrary to ill ordinAry practice, by which most persons were left at liberty till they decided on appealing or not. Most of them used the interval to escape to England or America. The London Punch has been prohibited by the Post-office of Koningsberg. The Koiner Zeitung has a telegraphic despatch, dated Berlin, Jane 26, stating that the semi-official papers announce, on IIn doubted authority, that Lord Palmerston, in an official note, and also in a confidential communication, to the Prutstan Cabinet, haa done everything in his power to obviate any further conse- quences that might arise out of Lord Brougham's late rude lee haviour towards the Chevalier Bunsen. AUSTRIA. VIENNA, JUN. 2,-We learn from Milan that not four, but fourteen, forts are to be erected there. They are to be so placed that one is to be a protection to the other, and also to guard the town from foes without the walls. An Englishman, an engineer, Mr. Charles Aston, who ren. dered essential services to the insurgents, especially to the general ataff, was lately brought here from Comoro. He was taken aWII, under Austrian surveillance by the Northern Railway to the ex- treme Austrian boundary, and there left to shift for himself. THE PAPAL STATES. The anniversary of the election of Pius IX. was celebrated at Rome, on the 17th, in the Sistine Chapel, with the usual pomp. Cardinal Ferretti performed High Mass in the presence of the Pope, who was seated on his throne. Cardinal Lambruschini afterwards offered hit holiness the congratulations of the Sacred College. AMERICA. The United States mail steam-ship Atlantic, Captain West, arrived at Liverpool, on Wednesday last, after a very rapid pas- sage. She brings advices from New York to the 151h ult. From Havannah, we learn that 61 of the volunteers, captured during the late invasion, were under trial in the Maiine Court. The island was peifectly tranquil. Advices from Mexico state that the Congress was to meet on the 20tb, to consider the state of the Treasury. An application for a writ of error in the case of Piofessor Webster, lately con- victed of the murder of Dr. Packman, was under the considera- tion of the Supreme Court of Boston. The points ruised were that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction in the case, and had 110 right to try Webster; that net, her judgment nor sentence was in accordance with the requirements of the statute that DO record of the ordering of the case to the Supreme Court by the Municipal Court appears; that legal service of the indictment does not appear to have been made that the sentence WRI n^t in accordance with the statute, in saying that the said Webeter should be taken from the gaol wllence he came and thence to the place of etecution, which is in the precincts of the gaol. The Municipal Court not having performed the primary proceed. ings in the case, the Supreme Court had not yet acquired juris. diction that the Supreme Court had not yet been furnished with the records of the Municipal Court in the case, the simple eD- dorsement of the clerk of the Municipal Court upon the indict- ment not being sufficient to give the Supreme Court jurisdiction. The steam-ship America arrived at Liverpool on Sunday, from New York. The passage was effected to ten days and twenty font hours. T he political news is of ordinary character. The feari ectertaiaed of the vindictiveness of the SI anish authorities in Cuba have proved groundless. All the prisoners taken 00 the a( welt a* fiWthe neutral territories, have been released (be Spanish officios. Ti.e only sufferers, stric tly speaking, \u00e2\ufffd\u00a0y invasion, are General Gooxales, Colonels O'Haia and Piekettf'ftQd a few other American officers, and volunteers, who were badly wounded. They are, however, in the United States territory. There has been no division as yet on the Compromise (Slavery) Bill in Congress. The application for a writ of error in Professor Webster's case haa not been determined. The fact of riots at Panama (in which some Americans were killed) having been fomented by United States citizens, had brought the matter before the public through the press, and some law is suggested to meet such cases there and at California, where The adventurers do not confine themselves to friendly rela. tions with neighbouring states. The tobacco and wheat crops are said to be somewhat injured by a prolonged continuance of dry weather. A disaatrons fire look place at Montreal, on the 15th of 13st month, by which St. Ann's Church, and some 200 houses, were burnt.

In consequence of th IS d Isfigul emen t the bill was thrown out in the vote on the eiiscitible. The Ely- seans were disgusted with it because M Baze had caused a clause to be introduced, obliging funciion- anes o designate their employments On the other hand, the Mountain objected to it because the whole i b ulled to restrict liberty of petition Finally, '\"ajority, considering that the admission of 11a Ie signatures opened a door to endless abuse, u;d emiiely vitiated the nrinciple of the bill, threw t <>n-;iderab!e sensation his been excited by an ar- 111 'be Assemblee Nationale,' stating that the ( ouiii de Nesselrode has addressed a despatch to the representatives cf Russia at Naples, Florence, and Rome informing them that Russia, Austria, and JJ; 11^sr;\u00c2\u00bb have agreed to place immediately at the dis- posal of those governments all the assistance which t-iev may lind themselves under :he necessity of de- in;11Mi;U\u00e2\ufffd\u00a0_ \"'1::l!1l'5t revolutionary movements.

The character of the Assemblee Nationale,' however, tioui ihe tact of its being the organ of Guizot, who IS likely to have correct information as to the inten- tions of the llusstan government, gives importance to it.

The number of names to petitions since the I st instant has been about 30.000 dailv, so that up to tile present moment the totatnumher is about 1,300,000. A dispute has taken place between the Fiench authorities and the British vice-consul at Houen, on the subject of the succession of a Mr. White, who died suddenly in that town without leaving any heirs, alld whose property was then claimed both by the slate and by the representative of England, as a British subject. The seals-which were put on the furniture and papers of Mr. White were removed by the jugp de paix, in presence of the British vice- consul, and a strict search made, but no will was found. The affair will now undergo a thorough judi- cial investigation, in order to ascertain to whom the property belongs, as the deceased died intestate. ROME\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA letter from Rome says: -All Rome is j':st now interested in the struggle between General Gemeau and the Papal authorities with regard to the occupation of the localities demanded by the former and lefused by the latter, and, although force is on the side of the French, it is generally believed that they will have to knuckle under to the ecclesiastics in this as well as in so many other disputed points. The reply of President Bonaparte, to whom the liliganl parties forwarded despatches, requesting him to arbitrate between their claims, arrived here two or three days ago, Ffter having been ardently expected on both sides. It appears that the French govern- ment, whilst protesting its good-will towards the lioly Sce, and its firm determination to tipliold tire cause of religion, justifies the measures tal.en by General Gemeau, and explains the necessity and right of the Commander-in-Chief to insure the safety of his army by occupying positions of strategic iil. portance at the same time, the general has been instructed not to push his claims so far as to take forcible possession of the Quirmal palace, if not vo- luntarily yielded up by his holiness. The indepen- dence of the sovereign is to be so far respected, that his apostoLc residence is not to be actually invaded by his faithful alLes. Ail sons of rumours are prevalent with respect to the arrival of fresh troops, and two regiments are ex- pected at Clvita Veccllla, but up to tbe present mo- ment there is no news of any having entered that port. The 54rd ot the line, whose officeis objected to seeing French patrols headed by papal sbnn, is to be sent either to Africa or Corsica. A row took place two days ago near the Chiesa Nuova, which ended fatally for a Roman, a knife- grinder by trade, who was engaged in it. It seems that he was disputing with another man, with whom y e finally came to blows, when some French soldiers passing by endeavoured to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands, and, entering a neighbouring house, got up to the roof, and so passed over the tiles to anoth-r house, where he took refuge with his amorosa. The Fienchmen, baulked in their first at- tempt, obtained a reinforcement, and laid siege to the stronghold, and obliged the gtrl to give up the of. fender, who n.ade so tremendous a resistance that the French officer in command ran him through with his sword. Such, as least, is the report current. The man is either dead, or mortally wounded. TUSCANY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe young Ellgllshmen (the Aldho- roughs) wiio were arrested at Leghorn are still impri- soned in the Fortezza Vecchia, where they will remain until the commencement of their trial. Nothing has transpired :o throw a light upon what w II be their ultimate sentence: it is generally believed that banishment from Tuscany will be passed upon them. D.I:N-IIAP,K.-A tele,rapliic despatch from Ham- burg, o1 the 3>d i.ist., announces the receipt of in- telligence from Copenhagen. The Danish ministry had given in its resignation cn mame. The cuplIal was much agitated. It IS supposed that there will be modifications iu the constitution of 1848. Count Moltkp has been charged with the reconstitution of the ministry, whose programme is to be complete unity of the Danish iiiotiarcity-ilie assimilation of Sehleswig and Holstem. Germany cannot, however, allow the absorption of Holstein into Denmark. UNITED STATES.-Oll Monday morning the Royal Mail steam-ship America, Captain Shannon, arrived in the Mersey, iron* Boston and Halifax. The aspect of business at New York was much the same as when the Pacific sailed money was slightly easier, and a little more confidence among merchants. There is noihing new by this arrival hom Central or from South America, or from the West indies. The presidential election was exciting an unusual degree of interest among all classes and [);iri ics. Besides Mr Fillmore, the present chief of the federa- tion, Mr. Webster's chances are spoken of as consi- derable. A report was current at New Yoik that two agents of the Mexican government had airiv^d at Washing- ton, vested with full authority to sell Lower California, Sonora, and Chihuahua to the United Slates, with the hope of improving the embarrassed finances of Mexico, and preserving her national existence, at least for a time.

They relinquish the title to the lands they held, and consent to occupy four townships between the Mercedo and Tllolumne Rueis. The L-nited Stites agree to provide for the comfort of the Indians, to cherish the arts of peace, and to furnish the means of education and impiove- ment.

The Paris correspondent of the *Dai)y News' says :-General Baraguay d'liilliers, who replaces General Changaniier in the command of the first division, has been, ever since his return from Rome, where he had the chief command of the French ex- peditionary army, pointed out as the rival of the late commander-in-chief of the army of Paris, and was mentioned as a likely successor to General d'flaut- pool as Minister of war. He IS of quite as deep an Elvsean dye as the new minister of war. He is one of the African generals, and distinguished himself ill the weirs of Algeria more by his personal courage than by his strategic ability. When the revolution of February broke out, he commanded at Besancon, wheie he commenced, against the commissaries of the Provisional Government, the opposition which he has continued to show to the republic as understood by the democratic party. As pres dent of the club and of the electoral committee of the Rue des Poitiers, he exerted himself energetically for the conservative cause. In the Constituent Assembly his votes were constantly hostile to democratic measures. Since his return from Rome he has been one of the most marked adherents to the President. In the Assembly he represents the department of Doubs. Sp A IN.-The cabinet of Madrid has resigned General Narvaez left Madrid immediately for Bay- onne, where he now is.

The same proceedings took place as in the first; different projects were proposed, several memorials pro and con read, and -tie only result of the three sittings which it has held will be a lengthy protocol. The Assembly at Kiel has resolved to authorise the Stadtholderate to accede to the demands of the commissioners on the condition that Rendsburg and Frederickstad should remain in possession of Schles- wig-Holstein troops. The directors of the Vienna Bank have all resigned their posts. According to private information which may be relied on, the following are the conditions the Aus- trian commissioner would lay on the Stadtholderate the Schleswig-llolstein army to be withdrawn over the Eider, and reduced to a third of its present force; the Danes also to reduce their army in Schleswig, nevertheless being at liberty to maintain garrisons on all points of danger, even in Rendsburg the As- sembly to be dissolved the Stadtholderate to remain till two German and one Danish commissioner un- dertake the direction of affairs.

LEVANT MAIL.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe have received Athens papers to the 28th ult., and Constantinople to the 24th The reports of the sittings of the Chamber of Depu- ties of Athens are uninteresting. The Courrier d'Athenes' states that bands of robbers continue to infest the country. A party of brigands lately pil- laged the principal houses of the village of Melissima in open day. A few days after this exploit, the rob- bers had a skirmish with a party of soldiers, of whom one was killed and another wounded. Scenes of a similar description have occurred in Eubcea, L;vadia, Bceotia, and Attica. At Gortyna a party of ninety travellers were attacked and robbed on their way to Tripolizza. A numerous band attacked the village of Machala in Acarnanie, pillaged several houses, and put some of the inhabitants to the torture. On the 17th ult., a band of twenty robbers, under the orders of Coatzomili, attacked the Turkish village Zatanti, and had a skirmish with an Ottoman detachment, which lost two men. The Journal de Constantinople,' of the 24th ult., mentions an insurrection which had broken out at Damascus against the recruiting laws, but was quelled by the Imperial troops Eight of the ring- leaders were arrested and sent to Constantinople to be tried the other prisoners made on the occasion were sent to Canea, to be enrolled in the regular troops. j INDIA AND CIlINA,-By a telegraphic despatch from Trieste in anticipation of the overland mail, we learo that the greatest tranquillity prevailed through- out India. A trifling encounter took place at the Kohat frontier, between the British troops, under Major Taylor, and thp Wuzeer; the latter were re- pulsed by the British troops, and only one wounded. On the 31st of November, the Governor-General set out from Amar Kullen to proceed to Lemdar- rneer. Malignant fever and dysentery are decimating the troops in the Punjaub. Sir Charles Napier was expected at Bombay on the 3rd of January. Java is tranquil. Piracies are still being perpe- trated. Siam is tranquil, but apprehensions existed as to its future state. The King is constructing a fort. The Indian papers have late news from New South Wales, from which it appears there had been heavy gales, in which sundry vessels had gone ashore and been wrecked.

FKANCE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdCommenting on the policy of Louis Napoleon, the correspondent of the Daily News' says:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" The game seems a good one for the El ys\u00c3\u00a9e; the reds cause fear; the elder branch commits faults, and the Orleans branch does nothing. The councils- general do not agree; the press is a dispersed army, in which there are only sharp-shooters; the national guards keep aloof. By the expedition to Home and by the law on instruction the-Napoleonian Idea has given pledges to the clergy. By the law on the mayors, it lends to possess itself of public opinion III the communes. By the choice of eighty-six new rec- tors, it has been able to give itself auxiliaries in all the schools. Thus, in add-on to the prefects, it believes itself able to have a great many cu es, m iyois, school- masters, and through them the mass of the village populations It has obtained from the Assembly all that it could give; the commencement of a civil list; the f^rgetfulness of several acts of imprudence, and a clear field for three months We may add that a part of France, from fear of socialism, appears disposed, if not to aid the Elysee, at least to let it act. The examination into the affair of distuibances of the Drome is being actively carried on. The leader of the affair, a man named Pascal, his brother, and another individual known by the sob/ iqnet of Giaillon, have just been arrested by the gendarmerie of Loriol. All the villages on the banks of the Rhone have been cleared of the men, who kept up a constant agitation in those parts. Several arrests were effected by the police on Sun- day night, at a meeting of a secret society held in the banlieue. Toe Journals of Burgundy state that the recent fine weathrr has had such a beneficial effect on the vines, that the fears which had been entertained of an indif- ferent crop have ceased. SPAIN. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAt Palma, in the ishind of Majorca, the river overflowed a few days ago with such violence that several houses were swept away, and the crops were entirely destroyed. Many of the inhabitants were only rescued from the windows of the upper stories by means of boats In 1403 there was an inundation in that island, by which 5,500 persons perished, and in 1618 and 1652 there was also in- undations by which great damage was done. One of the Spanish journals mentions a report that an English company is about to undertake the construction of the railway of Isabella I I. The Montemolinist journal, the Esperanza,' was seized on the 24th. ITALV.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe 23rd ult. will be a memorable day in the annals of Florence. Two decrees were pro- mulgated that morning, which destroy the representa- tive constitution and what little rema ned of the free- dom of the press. These fatal ordinances are posted up at all the street comers, and read in complete si- lence by crowded groups of citizens, who see with dismay the last shred of liberty torn from them, and the reign of absolutism restored. Henceforward the Grar, d Duke must govern by Austrian bayonets, and cn the first movement which shakes Central Italy he must stand or fall by the fortune of the foreign troops which he has called in to oppress his subjects. This law puts the whole press under the immediate power of the government, and as the council of mi- nisters may at any moment destroy the existence of a newspaper, without the possibility of an appeal to the tribunals, all guarantees for the investment of money iu such enterprises are completely suppressed. The inevitable consequence will be that the periodical press of Florence will in a short time be reduced to the level of that of Naoles, where there is only one organ, the Tempo,'and that is in the hands of the minister of police. Thus the events of Europe will be unknown to the great body of the people. One of the last acts of the Jesuits in Naples pro- hibits students of the bej public library from reading any books excepting those treating of mathematics and medicine. It is rumoured that the intrigues of the Jesuits have produced a ministerial crisis in Piedmont, and that the ministers have offeied their resignation. Some agents of influential parties in England have arrived in Naples, offering to carry on the Royal Railway from Capua to Rome, the contract for which has, it is said been completed. DENMARK AND THE DUCHIES.-Hostilities have re-commenced on the part of e Schleswig Ilol- Stemers. Late advices state that on Sunday last, Tonningen was taken by the Schleswig-Holsteiners' after two hours' fighting. It was afterwards occu- pied by two of their companies. The Holsteiners had made 217 prisoners. An important skirmish has also taken place near Beckendorf, and Friedrichstadt was bombarded. Oil the 27th the Schleswig-Holstein army left its cantonments, and the staff followed on the 28th. A detachment of Danish prisoners has been brought to Lunden. MECKLENBURG-SCHWERIN.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMatters in Mecklen- burg-Schwerin seem to be progressing towards the same dissension between the duke and his people as in Hesse Cassel. The constitution sworn to by the Grand Duke on the 10th of October, 1849, has been violated by a ministerial decree of the 14th instant, abolishing it altogether, and re-granting to the obnox- ious nobility, or junker, their old privileges and rights. The deputies refused to obey what they considered an illegal act, and intended to come together on the 241h ilistant, at the appointed time, for the purpose of car- ding on their deliberations. On the previous day, however, the president of the Chamber was seized by Jbe police and carried to prison. The members be- longing to the Left quitted Schwerin immediately afterwards, and from the village of Ostorf issued a Protest against the illegal proceedings of the govern- ment. It is signed by twenty-six members, and is distinguished by great moderation. The whole of the grand duchy is in a high state of excitement, and the rndltary force it possesses is in readiness to quell any disturbance at the first sign of an outbreak. It will I hardly be necessary, however, for them to act; the Population of Hessen have given so brilliant an ex- ample of the advantages of passive resistance, and the Prussian troops are too near the Mecklenburg frontier *\u00c2\u00b0 render it likely lhat resistance will be attempted y the people. The Engere Auschuss of the nobility and landed proprietors, abolistied for ever in 1848, is to be re-opened on the 28th instant, by a ducal com- missioner, and one of their first measures will be the lrnrnediate. restoration of their feudal privileges to their full extent.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. I FRANCE. I GENERAL LAMORICIEUE A MANIAC.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA report has been afloat in the higher circles of Paris for the last three or four days which has given the greatest pain and a'arm. It is rumoured that General Lamoriciere, who h id given several symptoms of aberration of mind ever since the fatal day of the Trees of Liberty, has at length been pronounced in a state of raving madness. The scene of that attack, puerile in its form, being organised by a band of mere gamins, and despicable in its consc- quences, has impressed itself so deeply on his brain, that memory has remained stationary ever since that hour, and that he is night and day in unceasing flight from imaginary pursuers, calling for his sword to defend him- self from his ideal assailants, and growing more and more frantic as they gain upon him in the fancied chase. His door is closed even to his most intimate friends, and much mystery is observed with regard to the cause: this alone would be sufficient to suggest all kinds of horrors to the lively imaginations of the Parisians, and induces us to hope that the report may be much exaggerated, if not altogether false. RUSSIA. I The Emppror has made over to his son, the Czaro- witsch Grand Duke Constantine, the splendid marble palace, with all its furniture and appurtenances, and per- mits him to designate it Constantine Palace. The Emperor has also thrown open all the harbours of Livonia, Esthonia, and Courland, to the importation of potatoes from foreign countries duty free. A private letter from St. Petcrsburgh states that a con- flagration broke out on the .5th inst. in the Palace of the Prince Peter of Oldenburgh, which attacked the treasury of the Prince, and consumed a variety of valuable docu- ments and bank-notes, besides melting a quantity of sil- ver bars. A fire also took place in the residence of Baron Fried- ricko. The Baroness was aroused by stones being flung at her window. Overcome by terror, she successively threw her three children from a window on the second floor the two eldest, four and five years of age, fell into a mantle which was stretched out to receive them by the people below, and the youngest, an infant, was caught by a gentleman as it fell. A letter from Bucharest of the 4th inst., announces that the Russian troops in the Danubian provinces have received orders from St. Petersburgh to evacuate those principalities on the 20th of the present month, with the exception of a garrison of 10,000 men, with 30 pieces of cannon. The official report of the Minister of Trade and Com- merce statt-sthat during the year 1849 the imports at St. Petersburgh amounted to 71,546,996 silver rubles, and the exports to 38,340,707 rubles. PRUSSIA. The Prince of Prussia had a very narrow escape of his life at Frankfort on the 19th inst. Ili., I)ed-rooii-i took fire. He, however, escaped with a few burns on his hands. The Government has determined to carry into effect the full incorporation of the Duchy of Posen. The plan has the support of the Chambers. Many of the Poles who declined taking the oath to the constitution as de- puties will have to do so as ofifcers of the Government. It is decided that the Erfurt Parliament shall meet on the 20th of March. The decree summoning it to assem- ble has been published. The military convention between Brunswick and Prus- sia has been concluded. AUSTRIA. A Vienna paper states that the Government has granted 1,600,000 florins for two frigates of 60, and one corvette of 30 guns. A fire, which broke out in the salt mine? of Bochnia, in Galicia, and lasted eight days, has at length been ex- tinguished. Five hundred miners were in the works at the moment when the flames broke out; but although a great number were brought senseless to the mouth of the shaft, they recovered with few exceptions. Prince Windischgratz has arrived at Vienna. Reports about changes in the Ministry are increasing. Field Marshal Count Dogenfeld will, it is said, undertake the War Department. It is rumoured that the newly-constructed constitution for the kingdom of Hungary is to be recalled, and a npw one, more consonant to the late events and the character of that nation, is to be substituted for it. SARDINIA AND AUSTRIA. I The Piedmontese Gazette of the 14th publishes offi- cially the treaty of peace between Austria and Sardinia, together with the law autliorisin, its execution. I THE PAPAL STATES. The Tuscan Monitor of the 12th inst. contains the fol- lowing, dated Rome, the 10th :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" Yesterday, about five o'clock, when the promenade, on the Corso, was drawing to a close, an unknown individual flung into the carriage of Prince de Musignano, the son of Prince de Canino, a splendid bouquet of white and red camelias, in the centre of which was a grenade, enclosed in a glass globe. This took place opposite the terrace of the Palace Bernini. The Prince picked up the bouquet to offer it to his sister, but as she \\Vas occupied at the moment in throwing flowers on the terrace, with her back to him, he held it in his right hand, waiting until she turned round, to pre- sent it to her, when the grenade suddenly exploded and severely wounded him in the hand, and still more seri- ously in the thigh, the artery of which was nearly lace- rated by the fragments of the glass. The sister of the Prince escaped with little injury in the side and leg, but she fainted from fright. The chief surgeon of the French army, who was then on the terrace of the palace, in- stantly bestowed on the wounded the care required by their position.\" The Nazionale of the 12th adds:- This would not have occurred if the Prince had taken warning from the reception he experienced when he ap- peared the first day on the Corso, and from the numerous cautions he had received respecting the impropriety of his showing himself thus in public, when his father was in exile. The Prince is said to have replied that he was a Ilrencliinaii, and not an Italian. When night came on, and at the moment the Corso was filled with a multi- tude of citizeus. carbineers, and police otticers, all of tttdo of citizenS s, n were oy enchantment, tricoloured Ben- auuueu, ana, gal fires were lighted on 200 different points of that mag- nificent street. It was a truly grand sight. The Car- bineers attempted to extinguish the fires, but were pre- vented by the crowd, and the French were heard to say, This is the anniversary of the proclamation of the Republic, which the Romans are celebrating.' The Opinione of Turin, of the 15t.h, states that the French continue to fortify Civita Veccliia on the land side. A French soldier having been murdered at Rome on the 10th inst., General Baraguay d'Hilliers has issued the following notification Inhabitants of Rome, the General-in-Chief, wishing to put an end to murderous attempts against the lives of the officers and soldiers of the army. decrees\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe carriage of dagger-knives, stilet- tos, and other weapons, which might serve to commit a crime, is prohibited at Rome and in its environs.

The most interesting event in the transactions of the United States Congress is the introduction of a series of resolutions into the Senate by Mr. Clay. The first main- tains the admission of California into the American Union, free from any restriction on the exclusion or in- troduction of slavery within its limits. In the second he proposes the same as to the territory acquired from Mexico. The third and fourth resolutions contend that the western boundary of Texas be fixed on the Rio del Norte, from its mouth to the mouth of the Rabine. The fifth and sixth assert that slavery ought not to be abo- lished in the districts of Columbia during the existence of the institution in the States of Maryland without the consent of the people of the district, and a just compen- sation to the owners of the slaves, and that the slave trade, under certain conditions, should be abolished within the federal district as repugnant to the common feelings of mankind. In the two final resolutions it is urged that provision should be made by Congress for the more effectual restitution of slaves in any State escaping into any other State or territory. The resolutions were sustained by Mr Clay, in a speech of masterly eloquence and ability, which produced a strong sensation on the Senate they were ordered to be made the subject of special consideration in the Senate on Tuesday, Feb. 5. The steamer Empire City, from Chagres, had arrived at New York with California dates of the 1st of January, and from 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 dols. of gold dust. Ope- rations had nearly ceased at the mines for the season, on account of the snow and rain, but the gold news is not less satisfactory than heretofore. The lately drafted constitution, excluding slavery, has been accepted by 12,000 to 8,000 votes. There had been a tremendous conflagration at San Francisco, which destroyed property to the amount of 1,090,000 dollars.

{"ocr": "I SLAVERY IN AMERICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdHER CLERGY AT THE GREAT EXHIBITION. I [From the Morning Advertiser.] I In a recent debate in thelHouse of Representatives at Washington, the Hon. Joshua R. Giddings, in referring to the late \"Fugitive Slave Bill,\" made the following comparison between Professor Webster, who was execu- ted last August at Boston,and the Hon. Daniel Webster, Secretary of State: Sir,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdI was about to make some comparisons, but perhaps theymay be regarded as indelicate. During last summer two distinguished gentlemen of the same name occupied much of the public attention. One was said to have committed murder, and the other to have procured the passage of this law one was hanged for his crime the other for his efforts, was taken into the executive ca- binet. One destroyed the life of an individual, the other contributed his efforts for the passage of this law, which must consign hundreds, perhaps thousands, to premature graves. I, sir, cannot speak for others; but, for myself, I would rather meet my final Judge with the guilt of him who has gone to his account, than of him who now sits in yonder cabinet!\" Language such as this, used at so early a period of the Congressional Sessions, gives little colour to the assertion of the political press of the United StaLes, and reiterated by the Correspondent of the Times,\" that the agitation upon this fearful law is subsiding. Calls for philanthropic measures in -this Itng.)orn are so numerous, that those who are really devoting them- selves to the removal of the eTils around us, may be ex- cused if they consider the American slave as too remote, and his ills too local for him to be benefittedby their aid, yet Britain has always boasted a considerable number of ardent friends of the oppressed 11('ro-maIlY whose hearts, even now, day and night, are weighed down by dwelling upon his wrongs, and who, with John Wesley, look upon American slavery as the \"sum of all vil- lanies.\" And when WAS there an occasion more urgent than the present for English sympathy and exertion in the work of emancipation ? In Scotland the friends of the slave have been for some time up and doing they have held meetings to give to their sentiments upon the \"Fugitive Slave Law, A considerable number of ministers oftile Scottish churches have taken part in the proceedings, and while the horrors of American slavery fully depicted and reprobated, and the iniquity of the Fugitive Slave Law\" was exposed to indignant audiences, the tremendous fact was prominently brought into view that the vast amount of injustice, cruelty, and crime perpetrated by the slave system of the United States was not only sanctioned, but fostered and main- tained in existence by the professed Christian ministers and churches of that country. Of this lamentable truth those versed in the history of American slavery have always been too well aware but the late cruel law is now giving to it a startling pre- eminence. It is worthy of particular remark that the conduct of the American clergy in the free states, in reference to slavery, has always been the reflection of the public opinion upon that subject; whether for right or for wrong, they have followed, but have not led the national sentiment. As the public have felt, the pulpit has spoken. The Protestant Episcopal Church has not shown the inconsistency which marked the course of the other re- ligious organizations of the United States. It never evinced any sympathy with the slave, and boasts of not having been disturbed by the anti-slavery agitation. Several of their Churches ate under coloured ministers, of great talent and unquestioned integrity but the Epis- copal convention has steadily refused to admit them into its body. Though the efforts of the American government to extend and perpetuate slavery by the addition of 25,000 squares miles of new slave soil from the free ter- ritory lately conquered from Mexico, and by passing the Fugitive Slave Law, have increased the anti-slavery agitation, and have compelled many conscientious mem- bers of the different religious organizations to join the ranks of the Abolitionists, the Churches themselves, with trifling exceptions, have evinced little sympathy for the oppressed; on the contrary, they seem more zealous than ever to follow public opinion in supporting slavery, upon the plea that, if it be interfered with, the continu- ance of the Union will be endangered. At the recent meetings in Scotland, the evil influences of the so-called Christianity of America upon the endea- vours to abolish slavery were shown by many unques- tionable examples. I In further evidence of the power of the church in main- taining American slavery, the following table, published by the Rev. W. G. Keppart, of the American Missionary Association, is quoted Slaves TheMcthodistshoId 219,56131 Presbyterians (old andjnew school), 77,000 Baptists 7,-ft. I COf) Campbellites \u00c2\u00bb\u00c2\u00ab1,000 88,000 Other Deiioiiiinations 50,000 Total owned by ministers of Gospel and mem- bers of Protestant churches 060,563 F Valuing each slave at an average of 400 dollars, or tSO here is a capital of E-52,815,040 invested by a Christian people in the bodies and souls of men. On the ground of this fearful statement, the Edinburgh Emancipation Society in its last annual report\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Would warn the Christians of Great Britain, in view of a meeting of the Evangelical Alliance in 18-51, to watch closely their steppings, lest in their efforts to pro- mote Christian union, they do injury to the cause uf true Christianity, by joining har.ds with those who act in dc- fiance of the whole spirit and tenor of the Gospel.\" And such an admonition is wisely given. Lamentable indeed for the cause of the friendless slave was the in- fluence of the sixty American ministers who attended the Evangelical Alliance in 1846, and who contrived, (under the professed guidance of prayer with fasting,) to quash the resolutions for excluding slaveholders from the meetings, and thus to throw open the doors of their Christian Assembly to the traiffckers in human beings\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd to the open defenders and perpetrators of the sum of all villanies.\" MN arnei by this controversy, from which it is feared the Alliance will never recover, the British organization of that body, at a meeting held at Torquay, last November, passed the rei,) Lilioll That regarding the present state of slavery in the United States, and more particularly the Fugitive Slave Bill, they cannot invite shareholders to their meeting in August, 18;51.\" Independently, however, of any effect upon the Evan- gelical Alliance, many a thoughtful mind contemplates uit.II DEEP anxiety the UNFAVOURABLE tnoml influence upon the anti-slavery sentiments of Great Britain, which is likely to be exerted by the presence of a large number of slaveholding, and pro-slavery ministers and laity, spread- ing themselves through the country on the occasion of the Great Exhibition. If it be considered necessary for the health and per- sotial security of the visitors at tite approaching exhibi- tion, that extensive sanatory measures and a large pro- tective force be called into operation, a spiritual police is not the less needed to prevent the spread of a moral pestilence through our land. And in few directions will its efforts be more desirable than in watching against the insidious misrepresentations of the pro-slavery ministers. Nor will those who openly defend slavery be our most formidable invaders. There is another more dangerous class-niiiiisters from the FREE States, professing hos- tility to slavery, but in reality sanctioning it under various pretexts. They are, however, easily recognised by the experienced friend of the slave, for they betray certain unmistakeable characters. As no public meetings in reference to American sla- very have been called in the metropolis at the present momentous crisis in this question (giving strong evi- dence, if such were needed, that the anti-slaverv feeling which once existed in England lies buried in torpor,) it is greatly to be hoped that the ministers throughout the country may exercise the needed watchfulness as to the\" American brethren,\" who may soon be expected to visit our shores, boldly inquiring of them what has been their course in relation to slavery, faithfully pro- tecting their own pulpits from being desecrated by the unhallowed services of slaveholders and their defenders. This question of human rights\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthis duty to the cause of the helpless slave\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdis of too solemn a character to be trifled with; even the conventional laws of hospitality ought not to stand in the way of the higher law.\" No one pretends to deny that it is the religious bodies of America who maintain slavery, or that, if they were faithful to their duty to God and man, this iniquity would at once terminate. The church holds the key of the slave's dungeon, and she will not unlock the door and let the captive go free.\" Under circumstances so awful, it surely becomes the duty of England, as a Christian country, to exert all the moral influence she possesses in pointing out to her brethren of the United States their unhappy position. We send missions to evangelise the heathen in savage lands; why should we pass by three millions of human beings in a Christian country, suffering all the ill of physical bondage, of mental thraldom, and of Pagan darkness, who are sighing for liberty, instruction, and the glorious light of the Gospel? The sentiment of the religious and intelligent mind of England cannot but have great weight with our leilow- Christians across the Atlantic. It would be a labour of love and of' mercy to them, as well as to the slave, to enlighten their understandings, and awaken then consciences. Could a more fitting work be performed, than for each section of the religious world of Great Britain and Ireland to send a friendly re- monstrance to those Churches of the United States, with which they sympathise in doctrine and discipline, upon their responsibilities, their duties, and their dan gers in relation to slavery ? Let it be remembered, that the existence is more to be deprecated in the United States, than in any other part of the world where it still prevails. For there it sins against greater liberty and greater light. The population of the States is now nearly twenty millions, and its increase is so rapid, that it is estimated that it will amount to one hundred and fifty millions in another century. The L'nited States are the asylum of the poor and oppressed of other lands.

This coast (the South Stack, Holyhead) is the resort in the breeding season, of in II umpra ble sea birrls espe- cially gulls, razor-bills, cormorants, and guillemots, but there are no puffins; peregrine falcons breed in the loftiest crags. No one, by order of Government, is allowed to shoot the sea-birds, as in foggy weather they are invaluable to steamers and shipping, being instantly attracted round a vessel, or induced to fly up screaming, by the tiring of a gun; poor Captain Skinner's mail packet was once saved in this way.

It is difficult in this country to conceive the force and influence of this unmitigated tyranny. With us party ?nRueneea are weakened by local distribution. In Aine? rica they are concentrated into one inflexible despotism, which every member of the party implicitly obeys. In this respect, the party man in America is entirely divest- ed of his individualism. lie acts and thinks with his party its will is his supreme law. The mischief is, that this strict obedience is alike required through good and through evil report. The policy of the day must be upheld, whatever it may be. It is thus that the flagiti- OU8 war with Mexico was espoused by the whole demo- cratic party, and that no democrat who had any favours to expect, or who would escape annoyance, dared utter a syllable against the conduct of the administration. \"The man who wouldn't stand by his own prez'dent deserves to be tabooed,\" said a democrat to me one day, on my suggesting, about the period of its commence- ment, that the war might not be universally acceptable to the party. This is the true spring of party action. Stand bv the president, or, in other words, stand by the party, whatever may be the complexion of its policy. ^'here must be no squeamishness. The man who is not aot, is declared to be cold. The rotten limb is imme- diately lopped off the tree. It is not only the rank and pie that yield to this terrible infltience-the party lead- ers bow to it with a fatal submission. There are hun- dreds around them who, for their own purposes, are constantly taking the measure of their political stature, and who are ever ready to report any questionable act, incautious sentiment, or inapt expression, to their com- mon master. Nay, more, a rival is frequently got rid of by first entrapping, and then denouncing him. This intellectual stibjugitiin- this utter absorption of the individual in the pany-i, perhaps, the worst achieve- ment of American democracy. It is felt to be a galling tyranny by more than dare confess it so and establishes this curious anomaly, that in the freest country in the ptorld, a man may have less individual freedom of politi- pal action or thought than under many of the mixed governments of Europe.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdifackay's Western World. DEATH OF WORDSWORTH. It is with feelings of regret that we announce the death of William Wordsworth. The illustrious poet breathed his last at noon on Tuesday, by the side of that beatiful lake in Westmoreland which his residence and his verse had rendered famous. We are not called upon in his Case to mourn over the untimely fate of genius snatched away in the first feverish struggles of development, or even in the noon-day splendour of its mid-career. Full of years, as of honours, the old man had time to accom- plish all that he was capable of accomplishing ere he was called away. Removed by taste and temperament from the busy scenes of the world, his long life was spent in ,tlie conception and elaboration of his poetry in the midst .of the sylvanic solitudes to which he was fondly attached. His length of days permitted him to act as theguar\u00c3\u00b9ian of his own fame\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhe could bring his maturer judgment to bear upon the first bursts of his youthful inspiration, as well as upon the more measured flow of his maturest compositions. Whatever now stands in the full collec- tion of his works has received the final imprimatur from the poet's hand, sitting in judgment upon his own works pnder the influence of a generation later than his own. It is sufficiently characteristic of the man, that little has been altered, and still less condemned. Open at all limes to the influences of external nature, he was sin- gularly indifferent to the judgment of men, or rather so enamoured of his own judgment that he eould brook no teacher. Nat-ire was his book, he would admit no inter- pretation but his own. It was this which constituted the secret of his originality and his strength, at the same time that the abuse of the principle laid him open at times to strictures, the justicp of which few persons but the unreasonin g fanatics of his school would now be prepared to deny. William Wordsworth was born in the year 1770, at Cockermouth, in Cumberland. His parents were of the middle class, and he was educated, together with his brother, afterwards Dr. Wordsworth, at the Hawkshead grammar School. It is stated that at thirteen years of age he first made an effort at composition, but it was not until ten years had elapsed from the time of his boyish efforts that he ventured to appear in print. In 1787 he entered St. John's College, Cambridge, where he gra- duated. Shortly after he made a Pedestrian tour in France, Switzerland, and Italy, of which the result was a volume of Poems, entitled Descriptive Sketches in Verse.\" This production was accompanied by another poetical work, entitled the Evening Walk,\" an Epis- tle to a young lady from the lakes in the north of Eng- land.\" Ihese formed together the young poet's first appeal to the public. They were issued in 1793, and at once arrested the attention of discerning men. Mr. Wordsworth afterwards went to Paris, but was compelled bv the I- Reign of Terror\" to return to England. He then made a pedestrian tour in his own country, the result of which was that he settled down for a time in a cottage in Alforton, in Somersetshire, in a picturesque yalley\", near Sether Stowey. It was here that he began that intimacy with Coleridge, which so much influenced the subsequent intellectual life of both. One result of this sojourn in Somersetshire was the publication, in 1798, of a volume of poems, which he entitled Lyrical Ballads. Soon afterwards he went, accompanied by his pister, on a tour in Germany, where he was joined by iculeri(ige. The two popts were then comparatively un- known to the world, although their originality and#the ?cauty of the little they had done had already rivetted the I attention of a few admuers. Thirty years after, when fach had asserted his peculiar genius, and had been ad- mitted into the brotherhood of poets, they again visited together the scenes of their early excursion. In the year 1803, Wordsworth married Miss Mary Hutchinson. of Penrith. They resided at Grussmere, in Westmoreland. In 1807 1\\11': Wordsworth published a etcond volume of the \"Lyrical Ballads,\" and his other poetical work, appeared at intervals, sometimes of two three, or more years. With progress of time his fame grew and spread, the objections of his critical detractors lost their influence, and the true characteristics ol his genius were more and more appreciated by his country- men. Mr. Wordsworth had early received the appoint- ment of Distributor of Stamps for the counties of Westmoreland and Cumberland. This, with the tardy though sure profits of his works, enable him to live in a fiignificd independence, in the midst of those beautiful scenes by which so much of his best poetry had been in- spired. On the death of Southey, he was nominated to the post of Poet Laureate. Neither time nor the occasion calls for or allows any attempt to criticise in this pI:ce the poetry of Words- worth. To recal associations of reverence and delight we peed only mention the Recollections of early Child- hood,\" the\" Lines on re-visiting Tin tern Abbey,\" some of the Sonnets, the \"Highland Girl,\" and some pas- sages in \"1 he Excursion,\" not excelled in grandeur by any poetry in our language. Opposite in character, and juore artistic in form, are the Dion\" and the\" Lao- damia.\" Butmoicto our immediate purpose is it to remind the reader thai the p\"ewsof Wordsworth, follow- ing as. they did upon the feverish excitement created by Lord Byron, exercised, slowly perhaps, but permanently, a deep and renovating moral influence on the growing piind of his nation.

Now that the great aim of Government is to popularise order, and to provincialise France, an immense advan- tage has been offered to a party which owed its ruin to its maintenance of what it chose to call order, and whos\" main strength lay in the provinces. The necessities of other parlies in the state compelled them to adopt a course of which, without, stirring a step themselves, the Legitimists reaped half the benefit. With a little policy, and a little self-control on the part of his supporters, the current of events might in a year or two have seated 11 envy V. on the throne of his ancestors. The hare idea foul\" years ago would have been scouted as mad- iiess at present the thing was not only possible, but probable, and that by no effort whatever of the party or of its chief.

This kind of proceed- ing M. de la Rochejacqueiin calls a return to the princi- ples of the seventeenth century, which his opponents probably would not deny and says that when France wanted a Sully, it gd, a Due da Blacas. It is. doubtless, sufficiently mortifying, with so many trumps in his hand, to find the game thus wantonly thrown away. The party are now just where they were years ago they have refused to associate themselves with the unexpected movement which promisrd so much for them, and as nothing else has placed them in a better position than they occupied before, they must be con- tented to retain their old place as representatives of times gone by, and the determined upholders of exploded ideas.

The President of the French Republic gave a grand review on Wednesday in honour of the Nepauiese Am- bassador, at Satory, near Versailles. It was a very splendid affair, being favoured with the most magnificent, autumnal weather. Louis Napoleon was accompanied by General Changarnier, the Minister of War, the Min- ister of the Interior, the Prefect of Police, and several other generals and aides-de-camp. The Marquis of Nor- manby, who has a country-house in the immediate neigh- bourhood of Versailles, gave a splendid dejeuner on this occasion, which was attended by the President of the Republic, the Nepaulesc Princes and their suite, the Ministers, General Changarnier, &c.

Two of them were executed, and the third j sent to the hulks. The Ocean, of Brest, gives the fol- lowing particulars of the execution \"Ihe scaffold was furnished with all the sinister appliances usually display- ed on the occasion of naval executions Detachments from all-the corps of marines, and the crews from all the vessels in the harbour, arrived at a quarter to 11, and were drawn no around the barracks, Tile platoon charged with the duty of executing the sentence took up its position at a distance of 20 paces from the condemned. Some minutes before the execution the gates were opened and the public admitted. Costa and Domingo were then brought from the prison and conducted to the barracks, each accompanied by a priest. As the convicts entered the court the drums beat to arms, and the condemned men were led to the spot on which they were to expiate their crimes. Both embraced their confessors and pres- sed the cnieifyi. to their lips. At that terrible moment the courage of da Costa failed he asked for a glass of water, which was immediately brought. The eyes of both were then bandaged, and the two knelt on the ground. At the same moment detonation was heard, and the unhappy men fell, each on his side. Da Costa was killed at once Domingo showed signs of life. The surgeon, ascertaining that the pulse yet beat, made a sign to the sergeant, who approached to terminate the sufferings and life of the unhappy man. His musket, however, missed fire, and a second sergeant was called, who, placing the mouth of the piece to the ear of dying man, blew off the top of his skull. After the execution the troops present defiled before the bodies, which were then removed by convicts from the amphitheatre. TURKEY AND AUSTRIA. A squabble has arisen between Turkey and Austria as to the terms of the arrangement by which Turkey agreed to shelter the Hungarian exiles. Turkey had stipulated to keep them Under surveillance for a year. Tiiis the Austrians interpret to mean a year from the date, not of their refuge, but of their imprisonment, and protest, ill consequence, against the immediate release meditated by- Turkey. This petty-sessions way of viewing such a matter is almost unparalleled in the history of national littleness. The Moslems must, by this time at least,, have learned to respect the civilisation and Christianity of the huge empire at their side. v HESSE CASSEL.

The Queen, leaning on the arm of her husband, walked through the streets of Madrid to visit the churches, in compliance witti a vow made by Her ;\\1a- jesty during her confinement. The reports of impending dangers in the Ministry still exist, and many consider the question to be only one of time. It is said that Senor Bravo Murillo, Minister of Finance, has had differences with the head of the Cabi- net, about money matters, and that he is likely to retire; in which case, it is added, that the Home Minister, Count de Sail Luis, is to take the burden of the Finances on his own shoulders.

The outward mail, of the 24th of May last, reached Bombay in the short space of twenty-seven days fourteen hours. The rains had been late but were beginning to fall. There was a severe thunder- storm on the 14th, and some houses in the fort were struck by lightning. Sir Charles Napier takes final leave of India in October. Sir William Gomm is expected to take charge of the Bombay army in November. Mr. It. M. Stephenson and the engineering staff of the Bengal Railway have arrived at Calcutta, and finding the plan concocted betwixt the London Board and the Court of Di- rectors impracticable, are proceeding with the exa- mination of a new line, in hopes of obtaining a fundamental change in all their arrangements, and a further and fresh guarantee from the Court of Directors. The most feasible scheme seems to be to proceed in the direction of Burdwan, where large returns may be looked for from the trans- mission of coal and other minerals. On the ex- penditure of a million sterling the Friend of India assures us 7 per cent. gross gain may be looked for from this fall to be deducted the charges for working the line. One of the most distinguished of our Indian geographers has been removed by death. He was assistant to the resident at Hydrabad.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOne of the most enterprising medical men at the Presi- dency, Dr. Larkworthy, has been cut off by cholera. whose ravages he was at the time endea- vouring to stay or to mitigate. The steamer Europa, which arrived at Liver- pool on Monday, brought a week's later news from the United States. The funeral of the late President Taylor took place on the 13th ultimo. The occasion was marked in the principal cities of the Union by a suspension of business, and ceremonies indicative of the respect entertained for the deceased. The names of the new Cabinet selected by Mr. Milliard Fillmore, who succeeds to the executive chair, have not been officially an. nounced, and all is yet speculation as to the line of policy now to be adopted by the Government. The Cuban difficulty was on the point of satisfac- tory adjustment by the release of the Contoy pri- soners, who are probably before this on their way to the United States. The Canadian Parliament has voted 8000 dollars towards the great exhibi- tion of industry in 1851. The reports as to the Browing crops are favorable. Cholera is making fearful ravages in Mexico, and in some of the states in the Union. The great fire at Philadel- phia has resulted in the loss of property valued at a million dollars. There were thirty-nine lives lost, 100 persons wounded, and seventeen missing. As was anticipated there have already been some severe struggles between the Danes and the Schleswig-Holsteiners, which are detailed in an- other column. The Schleswig-Holstein forces, commanded on the left by Von der Tann, on the right by Von der Horst, and at the centre by Ge- neral Willisen, if not actually routed, were driven back with great slaughter on the 25th instant, after eleven hours' fighting in the vicinity of the now historical village of Ickstedt. The combat, beginning at three o'clock in the morning, appears not to have terminated until past two o'clock in the afternoon, when the German troops were com- pelled to withdraw hastily from their position, re- treating in the direction of Rendsburg. Towards nightfall the victorious soldiers of Denmark en. tered the city of Schleswig, so very recently the head-quarters of General Willisen; and among other testimonies of the triumph achieved by the Danish army may be mentioned the sudden and total abandonment of Eckernforde, its fortifications having been subsequently dismantled. Some ac. counts go so far as to assert that the Danes had penetrated even within the walls of Rendsburg but, taking even the most moderate portion of the intelligence as the only part of it deserving cred- ence for its acccuracy and authenticity, it is most certain that the defeat of the Schleswig-Holstein troops has been signal and decisive. The National Assembly-of France have at length succeeded in completing the list of twenty- five members of the committee of surveillance. Great excitement prevails in consequence of an- other attack upon the Assembly, which has ap- peared in the Momleur dIe Soir, said to be an organ of the President. The rumour that cholera was raging in most of the towns in possession of the French in Africa has been contradicted. The sanatory condition of the army and the people of Algeria was satisfactory. The liepublicain de Lot et de Garonne, the most vio- lent of the Socialist papers, has been obliged to cease appearing for want of funds. A Socialist journal, published at Besan\u00c3\u00a7on, has been seized by order of the Attorney-General. Two Socialists have been condemned by the Police-court of Va- lance, Drome, to eighteen months imprisonment for having a quantity of concealed arms and ammunition in their possession. The censorship of dramatic writings has been re-established. Rumours of a coup d'\u00c3\u00a9tat still prevailed in poli- tical circles in Paris, and the 15th of August, the anniversary of the birth of the Emperor, was vaguely spoken of as the day. The Imaum of Muscat has addressed a letter to the President of the French Republic, granting to French subjects permission to trade in that portion of the east coast of Africa belonging to the Imaum. We learn by letters from Rome of the 19th, that eight young men, arrested in the act of manufacturing Bengal lights, have been con. demned to twenty years' hard labour. Five more had been acquitted. The strangest tumours are current about the band of II Paacatore, who Itilf infests both the Tuscan and Papal Romagna, notwithstanding the exertions of the Austrian troops. Engagements are said to have taken place with his men in the vicinity of Cortona in which the Austrians were worsted. They also say that 11 Pastore has two pieces of cannon, that he has divided his band into three bodies, giving each a commander, and that he is well ptovided with arms and money. It is said that a conspi- racy of great importance has been discovered in Rome. Letiers from Madrid of the 26th ult. state that the Queen was so far restored to health as to transact business with her Ministers, and to hold a sort of levee on the occasion of her mother's file. A Carlist conspiracy has been discovered in the province of Segovi; many persons have been arrested. It would appear that the plot had numerous ramifications throughout the whole of Castile. The greater part of the clergy are said to be implicated in the project. i he dratt ot the convention tor the tinal settle- ment of the differences betweee Greece and Eng- land was signed at Athens, on the 18th instant, with the approval of the French minister. Letters from Malta say the cholera still prevails, and though there are fewer cases the deaths are as numerous as ever. The men and women of the 44th regiment still suffered, and not one of those attacked had been saved. A constant communi- cation was kept up by means of boats between the shore and the fleet cruising off the island, The number of deaths in the fleet was small com- pared with those on shore, only fourteen having occurred out of more than 300 cases.

It is also stated that the Queen, Prince Albert, and the Prince of Wales, are really to visit Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, making the line of railway their route to Holyhead, inspecting the tube, and the other wonders and tieauties of the neighbourhood.

The vessel will be under the command of Captain Ewing, who originally commanded the West India mail-packet from uth- There have -been some interesting discussions in the House of Commons during the past week; the Peers have taken it easily. The only matter worth notice in the upper branch of the Legislature was the explanation given by the Archbishop of Canter- bury, of the circumstances connected with the ap- pointment of his son to the Registrarship of tho Pero- gative Court of his Province. His Grace contended that he had only exercised a privilege to which he was legally and morally entitled. The Bishop of London corroborated the statement of the Archbishop1 and called the attention of the II..use to the manner in which his Grace had filled up the office of Regis- trar in the diocese of Chester as conclusive against any charge of nepotism, a stigma which more pecu- liarly attaches to the Grey family, who are excessively liberal in their appropriation of good places ajnongst themselves. The Bishop of London's Bill to amend the law relating to the administration of justice by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was been read a first time, his lordship stating that its provisions had been agreed to almost unanimously by the at chbishops and bishops. Sir George Grey's announcement of the intention of Government to introduce a new bill for regulating the hours of labour in factories, has elicited a letter from Lord Ashley recommending the committee of delegates to accept the Ministerial measure as the best compromise which they can now hope to obtain. The delegates bowever have repudiated the compro- mise offered by the Government plan, and have officially announced that nothing but a Ten Hours Act will content the factory workers, or put a stop to the agitation of the question. In this Lord John Manners, than whom there cannot be a more staunch or earnest friend of the poor, concurs, and though he agrees with Lord Ashley's opinion, that the frame- work of the Ministerial proposition was more likely to produce a beneficial result than the framework of the measure which he and Lord Ashley had intro- duced, he conceives that the honour of the House and the rights of the people are concerned in passing an elfective Ten Hours Bill, and has therefore given notice that, on the bringing up of the report, he will move that \"half-past five\" be suUituted for \"six o'clock\" in the evening\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdan alteration which, in point oHad, will make proposal of G.,er?i?nent, an effective Ten Hours Bill t= in its lyre\" \"t state it is con- sidered calculated to put a stop to the relay system, which has proved so oppressive and injurious to the factory worker. The Australian Constitution B 11 has also engaged the attention of the Commons, a motion for the recommittal of the Bill, for the pnrp ise of depriving the Colonial-office of the power to veto laws passed by the colonial legislature, and of defining the limits of the prerogative which the borne Government or \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 their representatives are to possess over subjects of colonial policy, having been brought for*-ard by Sir Wm. Molesworth. whilst Mr. Gladstone endeavoured to obtain the insertion ot a clause empowering the bishop, clergy, and laity of the Church of England in any colonial diocese, to meetwd make r. ;i- \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 .ns for the conduct of their ecclesiastical affairs, inde- pendent of itate interference. Both tlieseproposals were however rejected. The only other important questions-discussed were Mr. Ewart's motion for the repeal of the advertise- ment duties, which was opposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the old ground that he could not spare the money; and Sir Richard Willi mis Bulkeley's motion regarding the Holyhead Railway contract. We have elsewhere given a summary of the debate, from which it will be seen that Sir Richard succeeded in obtaining the appointment of a select committee of inquiry. The conduct of tho government does now appear to have been so just and politic either towards the public or the Chester and Holyhead Company as might have been the case, but on tlie other hand, their errors and motives havo betn greatly exaggerated and misinterpreted. We fear the contract will not be very profitable to the City of Dublin Company. In the Court of Common Pleas, on Wednesday, in the case of Gorham v. the Bishop of Exeter, the Lord Chief Justice intimated that the ,\\edsion f the court would not be given till next term. In the Arches Court, on the same day, it was expected that judgment would have been delivered on the monition issued directing the Bishop of Exeter to send in the letter instituting Mr. Gorham to the vicarage of Bamford-Speke; but at the request of Mr. Bowdler the certificate of monition was extended till next court-day. The latest advices from America are to the 27th of April. The New York Herald, referring to the Xira, ragua treaty, intimates that it lays the foundation of a complete revolution in the commerce of the world, and also sows the jeeds of a naval struggle between the United States and England which will surpass anything of the kind which has ever taken place in the history of the human race.

In France an attempt, is making to disfranchise from two to three millions of electors and not less than half the army. Generals Cavaignac and La- moriciere have separated from the majority and openly voted against the Government, but the first vote which determined that the bill be taken into instant consi- deration, was carried by a majority of 256 in a house of 650 members.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AXD COLONIAL SUMMARY. The British and North American Royal Mail Steam ship Europa arrived at Liverpool about midnight on Sunday, bringing a week's later intelligence from the United States. There is no political news of any im- portance. Business throughout the Union was brisk in every department of trade. The cotton market was rather dull, but prices were firm. The accounts of the cotton crop are uiifavourable. JenilN- Lind's reception has been most enthusiastic. The papers are filled with details connected with the arrival of the Mr visitant, and her subsequent movements. Professor Webster, as intimated in the telegraphic news by the last arrival, was executed in Boston on the olst ult. During the period previously to his j execution his demeanour was excelle iit, lie under- took daily devotional exercises. On the evening. before his death his family visited him as usual, and took leave of him without knowing that the final hour was near. The execution took place in the morning, within the precincts of the gaol, with the usual forms, j He died almost instantaneously. After hanging about half-an-hour the body was enclosed in a black pine 1 coffin and placed in the deceased's cell. Subsequently it was removed to the residence of his family, at Cam-1 bridge; and on Sunday was buried in the Auburn i Cemetery. The news of his death was communicated, to his family on the afternoon of the 31st, by Mrs. I Prescot, a sister of the deceased, and the Rev. Dr.1 Putnam. No confession of premeditation was made.

Trade was rather dull and goods had accumulated owing to the cholera. Tliere was very little cholera at Vera Cruz. In Havannah it had nearly disappeared; but at Jalapa it was very severe. The island of Cuba ex- perienced a severe gale on the night of tne/lst of August, amounting almost to a hurricane. The Le- gislature of Bermuda was prorogued by the Governor on the 26th ultimo. MeetInga on the subject of con- stitutional reform continue to be held in that colony. Cape of Good Hope advices of July 9, state that the minute of Earl Grey upon the subject of compensa- tion to parties who suffered injury in their property during the Kaffir war, had caused dissatisfaction, be- cause the new territory is to be made liable for the amount of the same, whereas the colonists think they should receive a free grant, and had held meetings to pass resolutions accordingly. Three of the principal mercantile establishments at Graham's Town were about to remove to Port Elizabeth, and this seaport at \u00e2\ufffd\u00a0 no distant date must be the commercial capital of the province. Cotton seemed to flourish still in particular localities, and samples had been shown 'w?ich had blossomed four months after the seed was sown. The large deposit of guano discovered at Dassen Island was valued at 1:40,(M. There has been some more rough work between the Danes and the Holsteins. On the 12th the Holstein army made a forward movement, intending to attack the fortified bridges across the Schlei at Missunde.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The Danes fell back from their unfortified positions at Kochendorfrand other points to their entrenchments, and withdrew the bridge. The works on the north banks of the Schlei were cannonaded for about an hour without effect. The batteries and their sup- ports were then withdrawn. The Danes made a short pursuit, and fired on the rear of the Holsteiners. The loss of the Holsteiners is estimated at about one hun- dred men. Eckenforde remains in the hands of the Danes. Hamburgh letters contain the following de- tails :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" The fighting was very fierce, especially at Eckenforde, which was taken and retaken twice on the 12th, and then remained in the hands of the Holstein- ers who established their head quarters there in the afternoon. The town had then suffered severely.\" The Danish ships of war stationed in the harbour fired broadsides untif the Holsteiners, having brought up some heavy guns, compelled them to leave. The wounded were sent to Kiel, and filled fourteen car- riages. The Danish camp at Eckenforde was des- troyed by ifre, and it is said that Frederickstadt was also burnt. At daybreak on the 13th the combat was n \u00ef\u00bf\u00bc ,e\". by if rAe, t d illisen mare l ,e d on Nlissunde to renewed. Gen. Willissen marched on Missunde to force the Schlei: but he was driven back, and with- drew behind Eckenforde, resuming his original posi- tion. Accounts report the Holstein loss at 129 killed and wounded, and amongst them five officers. Fifty Danes were taken prisoners. The reforms of the liberal Cabinet of Sardina are scouted by the Pope, as tending to infidelity. Some apprehensions have been entertained of rioting, if not revolutionary movements in Hanover, similar to the stand made at Hesse Cassell, where, as Bull says, \"the Chambers stopt the supplies, and the Elector stopt the Chambers.\" The foreign papers anticipate rat?er deplorable consequences from this rampant example of German liberalism. The Hessian Govern- ment must now stand or fall by force. The President of the French Republic visited St. Cloud:on Sunday, and was everywhere well received.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY. The Count de Chamboard, boasting of the blood of Henry IV. \"nd Louis XIV., and honoured by the party designated Legitimist, has followed the example of his inferiors, and es'ablisheda sort of provisional govern- ment, or cabinet, consisting of the Duke de Levis General de St. Priest, M. Berryer. Marquis de Pastoret' and Duke des Cars, This appointment is ffi,i,ll announced by a Se\"retar), M. Bart ?-, in a circutr io his club, containing a declaration of the principles by which the Count intends to be governed. He reserves to himself the direction of the general policy He has designated the men whom he delegated in France for the application of his policy, lie has formally and absolutely condemned the system of an appeal to the people, as implying the negation of the great national principle of hereditary monarchy.\" The Marquis de Larochtjaquelin had advised the' future Henry V. to appeal to the people. Tlrs manifesto therefore, has alienated the Marquis, and he, with many other Legitimists, have seceded from the cause, or, at least, withheld their active support, and the partv are now endeavouring to repudiate the indiscreet produc- tion of their Secretary. The divine right of the House of Bourbon having been so offensively set up against the will of the French people, the President takes advantage of the blunder of his antagonist, and ap- peals hy another manifesto, to the popular pleasure plainly asking for\" the necessary prolongation of the Presidential powers,\" and avows a belief that he should not answer the expectation af tilt six millions ofeitizeiis who chose him as the symbol of the ideas of order and prudent progress, inaugurated in 1789. if he were humbly to bow his head to the royalist coalition which imprudently sgitates the country.\" F'T an irreverent assertion that the President ate vegetables from the garden of St. Cloud for which he had not paid, the editors of the French newspapers are again required to append their signatures in full to the articles which they w rite. The trial of 31 individuals accused of having formed a secret illegal society, for the restoration of the elder branch of the house of Bourbon, was con- cluded on Saturday, before the Court of Assize at Paris. They were found guilty, and sentenced to im- prisonment for six months. The others were acquitted. The message which the President will deliver at the re-opening of the chambers, on the wishes expressed by the Councils-general, will bring before the chamber the question of a prompt revision of the constitution. Spain has condescended to relinquish her displeasure with the King of Naples in consequence of the Minte- molin marriage, and an Ambassador from Madrid will again honour the court of King Ferdinand. The Queen of Spain is said to be again eneiente. The twenty-second provincial Synod of Toulouse has closed its sittings with great pomp, and published its decrees on seminaries, ecclesiastical studies, pre- servation and extension of the faith, rationalism, and J b,). k s. socialism, and prohibition of books. At Florence the result of the communal elections of Tuscany was unfavourable to the Government. The ol)position,or constitutional candidates, were generally, if not in every instance, at the head of the lists; and the last tidings are, that the Grand Duke has issued a decree, by which the council of deputies is dissolved, the new constitution suspended, ar.d absolute power, protected by military combinations, reserved to him- self. Thirteen judges out of fourteen have pronounced the condemnation of Monsignor Franzoni. The position of the Danes and their antagonists remains about the same. Both camps are carefully entrenched, but the Danes have obtained entire occu- pation of the Friesland islands, opposite Husem, to the great strengthening of their position over that of the Schleswig Holstein army. The Koiner Zeiturnj has a telegraphic despatch from Hamburgh, of the 30th ult., stating that a general movement has taken place along the Sehleswig-Holstein lines, that the troops advanced against the Danes, and that an engage- ment ensued, in the course of which the fortified city of Friedrichstadt was bombarded on the morning of the 29th. The citv of Tonningen was carried and occupicd by the Holsteiners, after an engagement which lasted two hours. A party of Danish prisoners was brought to Lunden. A skirmish is said to have- taken place at Breckendorf. At ten o'clock on the morning of the 30th Frederickstadt was still in pos- session of the Danes, but the bombardment continued. The Holsteiners captured 217 prisoners in Tonningen. It is said that Willisen has expressed his determina- tion to level Friedrichstadt with t; e ground if neces- sary. The Danes have laid the whole level country on both sides the Treene under water. Von der Tann commands the division operating against the right wing of the Danes, and General Willisen, with the division under him, is watching the Danish centre. The King of Denmark arrived at Flen-burg. in company with the Hereditary Prince Frederick, on the morning of the 27th. The Copenhagen journals state that the King was about to issue another proclamation to the Duchies, countersigned by the great Powers, calling on the insurgents to lay down their arms within a given period, or the Danish troops would enter Hoistein. It is reported from Berlin that Baron Bulow, the Envoy of the Duke of Holstein to the Bundestae at Frankfort, has claimed the right, on the part of his Sovereign, the Kiy,g of Denmark, to occupy the Duchy of Holstein with troops, if the Bund cannot or does not enforce com- pliance with the terms of the treaty. The Kener Zeitunj t has a telegraphic dispatch of the :joth ult., stating that the Schleswig-Holsteiners have attacked and carried with the bayonet two of the entrench- ments of Friedrichstadt. They took fourteen pieces of artillery. It is also stated that Friedrichstadt is now surrounded on all sides. The Elector of Hesse Cassel holds out witii his ministers in his new seat of government, and the con- stitutional authorities and population of the F.lectorute maintain an attitude of temperate and stern indiffer- ence to his mandates. The question relative to the Hungarian refugees itl Turkey threatens to give rise to new complications. The terms of the convention by which the Porte engaged to keep a strict surveillance over the refugees during one year expires this month. The Turkish Government has manifested the intention of setting at liberty Kossuth. and those of his companions who were incarcerated with him at Kotaveh. The Govern- ment at Vienna ini$t that the torni of one year, sti- pulated in the convention. commenced at tlieniomei-. of their incarceration, and has protested against the immediate liberation of the refugees. The Emperor of Russia concentrates his attention on the state of the army, an d is about to hold a grar.J autumnal review. A general recruiting is go-,r,- for- ward throughout the empire, and at the same tiine desertions multiply. The Emperor had issued a ukase, allowing the men to have their heads shorn instead of shaven, except when one desered. in which ease his entire corps must pass their heads under the razor. Besides the ukase which strips the Jews of their ac- customed vestments, another allows Jewish children, from 12 years old and upwards, to be impressed for the imperial service, I- in order that they may have time to receive the inculcation of military tastes.\" These boys are chiefly destined to ships of war 0:: the Baltic. Sympathizing with the military taste of Louis Napoleon, Nicholas has written him a letter of ccn- gratulation on the vigour which he continues to display against the anarchists of France. The Ifibernia steamer arrived at I.iverpel from Bos- ton oil Sunday evening. The nomination of Mr. Stewart as Secretary of the Interior has been confirmed by the Senate.

{"ocr": "SPIRIT OF THE LONDON JOURNALS. MR. COBDEN'S SPEECH AT WREXHAM. I (From the Times.) Mr. Cobden, of course, has made a very taking speech, as he always does. Nobody is better able to engraft his own views on the current maxims of his country, and the peculiar opinions of his hearers. The ladies and gentlemen who heard him last Tuesday at Wrexham most probably went away with the im- pression that they had always thought and felt in some sort of fashion what lie had just been telling them, and that he had done nothing but bring it out, and give it a clever and interesting form. In fact, there is nothing whatever in his speech but what is based on some belief, or desire, or sentiment, either universal or extensive enough for an orator's purpose. Nobody likes paying taxes, least of all those who have earned what they pay, and who belong to the classes out of the reach of the political scramble. A man who looks on the Treasury as a Maelstroorn, or a Den of Cacus, that absorbs everything and refunds nothing, is not likely to love it. Very few people who are not\"sol- diers of fortune,\" or officers out of work, or the parents of young cadets, or army or navy contractors, or em- ployed in Her Majesty's dockyards, or otherwise directly interested in war, have any positive affeetiun for it, or regard it otherwise than as a horrible nui- sance. Arbitration, of course, is the desire of all ages, and nothing ever contributed so much to the success of the Papal pretensions as the idea that the Pope was, or might be, or ought to be, the supreme referee of the Christian world. If his Holiness had been at ell true to his character, and had not occasionally got up wars instead of confining himself to putting them down, there is no saying but what we might still have been his very humble servants, and Her Majesty would have had to return thanks at the opening of the next session for the present of our Cardinal Arch- bishop. Such topics as these are the common stock of peace-makers, whatever their wisdom or sincerity. Then, again, Russia is not popular in this country. It never was, and is never likely to be and the mass of the British will as soon believe the Emperor Nicholas capable of doing a good thing as his namesake in a warmer locality. Austria, too, is unpopular, and al. ways was, in this country. Except in our own little quarrels at home, we never remember an occasion in which the English did not take up the cause of the little fellow\" against the \"big fellow,\" that is, amongst nations, however saucy, or roguish, or mis- chievous the little fellow might be. So, on the whole, nothing is more easy than for a man who has a com- mand of the mother tongue, and who knows the way to the hearts of his species, to get up a good anti-war cry, a patent fever agitation-all his own, warranted to supersede every other article, and to make Mr. Cobden the principal peace-maker in Her Majesty's dominions, not to say the whole world. To say that we agree with a great deal that he says is only to say that we are Englishmen and men; for, by the peculiar assumption and the monopolizing tone in which Mr. Cobden says much that is trita and uni- versal, he seems bent on driving others into an argu- mentative advocacy of war, at variance with their natural feelings. He seems to say, Look at me I am the peace-maker. The newspapers are all war- mongers, tax-mongers, and king-mongers. Mark, then, how loth they are to do me common justice and yet they will come round to my opinions at lasf, and slaver me with their fulsome adulation.\" Now,, is this tone tolerable, and are we to be deterred from pointing out the absurdities or the mischiefs which Mr. Cobden chooses to mix with an otherwise good agitation ? If so, every impostor and every incendiary must be allowed his full swing, for there never was one, from Mahomet to Joe Smith, from Jack Cade to Daniel O'Connell, who had not a substratum of truth in his cause. Now, we tell Mr. Cobden that a man who comes forward as a peacemaker, and is really a very bitter partisan, is little better than a wolf in sheep's clothing. But is this not Mr. Cobden's inva- riable habit, and was it not the other day at Wrexham? He asks for courts of arbitration, and then prejudges every question now at issue in Europe, and stigma- tizes one of the parties in every quarrel. He repre- sents the Austrians and Russians as cutting the throats of quiet villagers, while it is notorious that at least as great atrocities were committed on the Hungarian as on the Austrian side. He sides with Holstein against the Danes, and represents the latter as unjustly and insidiously backed by the great Northern Powers, without saying a word about the Germans consti- tuting the principal part of the so-called Schleswig- Holstein army. Now, on these and other points Mr. Cobden is fully entitled to his opinion, and it is one that deserves respect. We may go with him a great way. We may think that Haynau showed unneces- sary severity, and that the Austrian policy has been that by which ordinary men consult self-preservation and which indeed few of us would hesitate to use against burglars and assassins. We may regret, as we do regret, that the Czar is actually stepping into that chair of arbitration, of which Mr. Cobden is vaguely and vainly ambitious. So, without quarrel- ling very much with Mr. Cobden's prepossessions, we merely say that the strength and asperity with which they are avowed are singularly at variance with the profession of international umpire, European arbitra- tor, and cosmopolitan peacemaker. More than that, we must confess our belief that Mr. Cobden's outra- geous and virulent partisanship, coupled with the be- lief that it is popular in this country, seriously injures our moral weight and political prestige in European affairs. We really can hardly respect Mr. Cobden's renewed attack on the Russian Loan. If it were possible to carry out such a feeling with tolerable consistency or the most moderate success, we should say, that cer- tainlya man may very properly attempt to starve out Russia or any other Power disagreeable to his feelings. But where are we to begin ? The possessor of Ameri- can bonds, in any shape whatever, lends money to war against Mexico and the execution of the Fugitive Slave Law, by virtue of which men are every day torn from their wives and children in the Northern States, and consigned to perpetual separation in the Southern ones. The possessor of French Rentes assists at all sorts of atrocities in Algeria, besides helping to main- tain a standing army of near 400,000 men. The possessor of Dutch Stock is paying the cost of some rather hard measures in Batavia. The proprietor of East India Stock is paying for our double invasion of Cabul, for the annexation of Scinde and the Punjab, and for the captivity of the Ameers and the Princes of Lahore. The moral position of a British fundholder is too delicate a subject for public investigation; but, if Mr. Cobden values a perfectly pure conscience, we trust that no part of the Cobden testimonial has been invested in Consols. So this crotchet is simply an absurdity, and we believe as unsuccessful as it is ab- surd. If Mr. Cobden can prove to the British public that the owner of Austrian stock may possibly find himself offered 5s. in the pound before another five years, and be glad to get that, by all means let him consult his political antipathies by doing so; but the moral principle cannot be carried out, for if we won't lend to a solvent Power, others will, and no power can stand an investigation into all its public acts. So much for this hobby. As to another passage in the speech, we hardly know whether Mr. Cobden seriously advocates passive resistance or not. If he does, we tRall wait for a more express and systematic profession of the doctrine before we remark upon it. As to the general substratum of the speech, the horrors of war, the nuisance of military and naval establishments, the injurious preisure of our taxation, and such common WiMi we beg to be considered as not yielding to Mr. Cobden in our sense of these evils, and we desire to abate them by all practical means.", "word": "1", "description": "\u2026 very properly attempt to starve out Russia or any other Power disagreeable to his feelings.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN AND COLONIAL SUMMARY. I There have been three arrivals from America in the last week: the steamer Washington, off Cowes, on Sunday' the Hibernia, at Liverpool, on the same day; and the Atlantic, at Liverpool, on Wednesday. T Ke latest dates from New York are of the 27th ult. The new President, Mr. Fillmore, had completed his administration. Mr. Webster was to be the Secretary of State. New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Albany, Newark, and Williamsburg, have been visited with a terrific storm of rain and wind, which has done incalculable mischief both on sea and shore. Vessels, buildings, trees, crops, telegraphic wires, &c., all suffered severely by its dest?nciive influence. The news of the death of Sir Robert Peel was received with great regret. The Compromise of Slavery Bill was certain to pass Congress before the 1st of August. General Paez arrived at Philadelphia on the 26th of July from St. Thomas. Pearson was hung at Boston on the 26th of July for the murder of his wife and two children. He confessed that, he committed the crime. The British steamer Tay arrived at Mobile on the 20th, with Vera Cruz dates to the 20th of July. The Indians continued troublesome near Brownsville. The Hon. D. P. King, Member of Congress, died at Washington on the 25th of July, of dysentery. Gen. Lopez arrived at Washington on the 25th of July. Professor Webster's appeal for mercy had failed; and his execution was appointed for the 31st of August. He exclaimed, on receiving the announcement- God's will be done; I am reconciled to my fate.\" The grain-crop accounts were highly encour- aging, and there is unmistakeable prosperity through- out the United States. Another extensive fire had broken out at San Francisco, which destroyed property to the value of 3,000,000 dollars. Cholera was raging in Mexico, with terrible results. The advices from British America are satisfactory. Thc members of thc Canadian Ministry proposed to reduce their own official salaries thu :-The two Attorneys-General, 3,600 dol- lars each; Provincial Secretary, Commissioner ofpublic Works, and Receiver-General, 2,400 dollars each the two Solicitors-General, 3,000 dollars each. The Cus- toms revenue of the port of Toronto, for the quarter ending in July, is above \u00c2\u00a330,000, being more than double that of the parallel quarter of last year. Accounts from Prince Edward's Island state that there is little doubt, in the event of the contemplated rail- way being made in these provinces, that the price of land will rise materially in the island, as such a market will then be opened up. The debt of the country is about \u00c2\u00a330,000, we learn, but owing to the differences between the Lieutenant-Governor and the House of Assembly the representatives of the people have declined transacting any business with him, and con- sequently have not voted the usual supplies for the public service. The revenue, amounting to about \u00c2\u00a320,000, will go towards paying off the debt. The roads, however, stand very much in need of repair, and cannot be compared to the roads in New Bruns- wick, There are Cape of Good Hope papers of May 25. The repeal of the order in Council making the Cape a penal settlement had afforded much satisfaction. The official estimate of the losses during the Kaffir war, sustained by the colonists in regard to their cattle, &c., had been published, and it is shown that there was a great deal that could not be recovered. Of the claims admitted, however, X406,000 were awarded. Locusts had appeared in great force in Kat River, and had devoured the pasturage on the Fish River. From Natal the advices by this opportunity are unsatisfactory. Nothing had been settled, according to the statement in the public journals, with regard to the lands of the emigrants, and it is alleged that among them, and especially those who had arrived more recently and remained in the division of D'Urban, considerable distress was beginning to be felt. Another party, writing, censures the supineness of the local govern- ment; but it is impossible for us at this distance, without more ample details, to decide who is to blame. The West India mail steamer brings late advices from the colonies. At Barbadoes the weather was very favourable, and all complaints of blight among the young canes had ceased. The cultivation of cotton was making progress in several of the islands, and superseding that of coffee. The weather was good in Demerara. Trinidad was fairly supplied with labour, but wages were high, owing to the dearness of food. In Jamaica the Assembly had got through its short session, and worked harmoniously with the Governor The Pacific adiiees of May 30 reach by this opportu- nity. The Chilian new Congress was about to meet. The revenue was increasing, although the imports cf manufactures had been smaller. From Peru we learn that the newly-discovered silver mines near Copiapo were daily increasing in importance. There is a pause in the military operations, on both sides, in Scnleswig, and nothing very important to communicate from Paris. It is reported that the British and French government have agreed to co- operate in an active mediation, with the view of bring- ing the Schleswig-Holstein war to a satisfactory and speedy conclusion. I sp On Tuesday, a terrific thunder-storm burst over Paris, and the streets were completely inundated. The horses in many of the streets were up to their shoulders in water the omnibuses that attempted to pass were filled with water; in some streets persons were swimming along; and, in the shops in the Chau- see d'Antin, the water was a foot deep. The bill for the resumption of cash payments by the Bank of France passed the Nationa l Assembly. The differences between the Executive and the municipal authorities of Marseilles have been satisfactorily settled. The idea of a camp at Versailles is abandoned. The Austrian government, it is understood, had strongly urged upon Prussia, the project of the grea Austro-Germanic Customs Union. At a Cabinet Coun- cil, on the 2nd, at Berlin, Von Radowilz proposed that the hndjoek of Westphalia and the Rhine provinces should be called out, because there was no doubt that a contest must soon commence at Mayenne between Austria and Prussia. Mantenfel strenuously opposed this step, saying Prussia was not likely in any way to profit by a war, and so the matter ended. Mr. Clay, the United States Charge d'Affaires, em- barked on the 19th, and sailed from the Tagus, steer- ing south, on the morning of the 20th, with the fri- gate Independence and the steamer Mississippi, leav- ing a consular agent at Lisbon. The British ex- perimental squadron was still at Lisbon. The Cortes was =,d by royal commission on the 20th. A French squadron of five line-of-battle ships and four steamers passed the Straits, from east to west, on the 26th ult. Destination unknown. The Prussian Government has received a despatch from the Cabinet of Vienna, announcing that Austria will oppose by force of arms the advance of the Baden troops beyond Mayence. There have been several Cabinet Councils held, and war between Prussia and Austria seems imminent. Austria has made repre- sentations on the subject of the entry of the Baden troops into Prussia to France and Russia. Prussia, has refused permission to the French Legitimists to hold their congress on any portion of the Prussian territory. They had originally fixed upon Aix-la- Chapelle. The Bavarian Government has determined to assemble a corps tftirmee at Aschaffenbourg, to be ready to act in aid of Austria against Prussia. M. Andrastz, the aide-de-camp of Haynau, has absconded, taking with him all Haynau's papers, as well as his correspondence with the Cabinet. It is said that he has taken the direction of Turkey. To meet the addition of officers from the several German states to the ranks of the Holsteiners, the Danish Minister of War has published a notice that such officers and men will not be treated, if taken in action, as prisoners of war. The Turkish Government, at the demand of the Russian and Austrian Governments, has ordered Gene. ral Dembinskv to be removed from Broussa to Kuta- hya, where Kossuth and his companions in exile are confined.", "word": "1", "description": "\u2026, and there is unmistakeable prosperity through- out the United States.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN* INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe clever editor of the Presse, who has lately fastened tooth and naitou General Changarnier, has just produced a tale which, if true, would certainly be the oddest ol' the many odd features of the late Revolution. The General, he afflnns, not only tendered his services to the Provisional Government, but undertook, *ith 12,000 men, to make Great liritain a Republic and a province of France. The other newspapers circuiaie the \u00c2\u00bbtory with- out comment, apparently expecting some l'arliameutary explanation. We may follow their example. Of the two hypotheses\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat General Changarnier was once in bis life mad or drunk, or that M. de Girardin is merely in- dulging his own eccentric taste by turning out a highly- wrought specimen of the lie circumstantial,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe latter certainly is more likely to be true. The news from France is confined to the speculations of the public journals on the approaching crisis of a new election for President. The Presse of Monday declares itself in favonrof General Cavaiguac as candidate, in 1852, for the Presidency of the Republic. It gays that the cause of General Cavaignac is making rapid progress, and has already been taken up by the mercantile and financial world. The feeling is becoming general,\" saya. the Presse, \"that to vote unconstitutionally for Louis Napo- leon would be to render M. Ledru-Rollin constitutionally eligible.\" The Opinion Publique publishes a note signed by M. Nettement, the editor, in which that gentleman declares that from a conversation he has had with M. de Falloux, he has ascertained that gentleman is strongly opposed to the prolongation of the President's powers. The Presse says \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd \"The fusion is settled. General St. Priest and General Changarnier have had a long conference. Such was the rumour prevalent yesterday at the Assembly. It may be that the fusion has taken place at Paris, but it is not so at Clarernont, where it was on Friday last altogether di-ap- proved of; for the Duke de Nemours, whatever may be asserted, ts on this point of the same opinion as his sister- in-law, the Duchess of Orleans, and his brothe/s, the Duke d'Auma'e and the Prince de Joinville.\" SP \\IN. Queen Christina experienced a series of do- mestic calamities last week. Her husband's brother, Don Juan Gregorio Munoz died suddenly at the Havannah; and the Queen-mother herself having h'oken her leg whilst stepping out of her carriage at Aranjuez, the phy- sicians lorhid Queen Isabella to visit her for fear the anxiety of the journey should blight the hopes of the nation. From Madrid, by letter of the 8th instant, we learn that the interesting position of Queen Isabella was no longer doubted. It is said that her Majesty formally declared to her three physicians, Drs. Gutierrez, Sanchez,-and Dru- ment that henceforth she intended to conform to all their wishes, and directed them to prescribe for her a h\u00c3\u00bdgeinic regimen, from w hid, \"be could'not depar.t. \"In that manner,\" added the Queen, \"all the merit as well as the responsibililyshall belong to you.\" PORTUGAL. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The triumph of Saldanha h complete. The King was left with oufyhatfhif) original forces at Pombal, atitl those hourly diminishing. Two regimeuts beiog ordered to march in presence of the King, cried out their road was Oporto, and immediately went off to the Duke. The Queen, hacked by the advice of the French Minister, tried to patch up three Ministries, one after another, of the remains of the Thomar party; but Sald- anha having entered Oporto and placed his sword and loyalty at the Queen's disposal, the better councils of the English and Spanish Ministers prevailed, and the Duke himself was commissioned to form a Ministiy. He imme- diately sent an aide-de-camp to Lisbon with the fol- lowing list:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdPresident of Council, Saldhana; Interior, Passoz; Finances, Francini Justice, Ferrao Foreign Affairs, Count Labradio; Marine, Viscount de Sa. PRUSSIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Chambers were prorogued at Berlin on the 9th iustant, by a royal commission. The speech) having intimated that the Government were prepared to meet revolution, in whatever shape it should present itself made the following brief allusion to Central German Union \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd \"The menacing position of those enemies, besides other motives, renders it the imperative duty of all German Go. vernmeiits no longer to leave Germany without a central organ, recognised on all sides, at home and abroad. But whether the German Governments now return to the forms of the older Federal Constitution, whether the plans for re- modelling the Constitution, which are nowise given up, shall be hereafter realised in an expedient manner, the in- dependent development of Prussia shall not, and will not. thereby in any way be endangered.\" The King is to mike a journey to Warsaw on the 15th instant. Aletter from Vienna mentions that the Emperor of Austria will probably have an interview with the Czar, io Cracow aJding- The object of Russia is, by effecting a firm reconciliation and co-operation between the monarchs of Prussia and Austria, to gain a firm ground upon which it may pave the way for the restoration of legitimacy in France.\" The King of Hanover paid a visit to theK;ng, at Char- lottenburg, on the 7th inst. He appeared, notwithstanding his advanced age, to be in good health and spirits; but during his two days' sojourn lived quite retired in his own apartments, not even appearing at the royal table. AUSTRIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdVIENNA, MAY 5.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Austrian Cabinet has just sent assurances of the greatest friendship for the present Portuguese Cabinet to London through our am- u3ssador there. RUSSIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe hear from good authority that the King of Prussia will have a conference with the Emperor and Empress of Russia at Warsaw, on the 15th.-An- zieyer Rietung, May 4. CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The Hellespont, Captain Walls, from the Cape of Good Hope, arrived at Plymouth Saturday morning, at half-past six o'clock. She left the Cape on the 4th of April\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe general aspect of affairs at the Cape, as stated by those who ar- rived by this mail, was, at the time of departure, in the highest degree unsatisfactory. Upon the whole line of frontier disaffection appears to have manifested itself, and even among the Mounted Rifles the greatest want of sympathy with the policy of the Governor prevailed. Forty-six men bad deserted from one of the companies with the whole of their arms and ammunition.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe governor was still at King William's Town, endeavouring to put dowo the rebellion, which caD DO longer be described by any other term than ItS an interopcine war. Among the colonists great dissatisfactiun prevtlile\u00c3\u00b9 with refereuee to the protraction of the war, and the want of some effi- cieot and vigorous step to put it down. Sir H. Smith had been compelled to disband a considerable number of the Mounted Rifles.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThere had been three engagements between the 18th and 25th of March; 77 of the enemy being killed in the two former. In the last 1,000 head of cattle, ammunition, &c., were taken from the rebels. NATAL.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAccounts to the 19th of March have been received, and it appears that the sister colony has been thrown into a high state of excitemertt in consequence of measures having been taken for mustering, the natives to proceed under Mr. Shepstone to the Amakosa country, and to co-operate with the troops under Sir H. G. Smitb. The most deplorable results are feared from the expe- dition, whether successful or cot. AMERICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLIVERPOOL, MONDAY\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBy the royal mail steam-ship America, Captain Shaunon, which arrived at the Mersey shortly before 6 a.m., we have advices from New York to the 29th uit. She brings \u00c2\u00a3 26,000 in specie 011 freight and the usual mail*. Our miscellaneous ae- counts announce that a large new steam ship, of 1,200 tons was being constructed at New York, for a new steam line' to run between Charleston and Liverpool II) Pittsburg Jenny Lind had been grossly insulted, stones having been thrown into her carriage, and afterwards into her dressing room. She subsequently refused to sing again, and left instantly for Baltimore. Great indignities had been offered in South Carolina to the officer from Boston who conveyed the fugitive slave S mms back to that state. Oil the 23rd lilt. a great entertainment was given at Astor-house, New York by the St. George s Society, at which Sir H. Bulwer, who had ju-t recovered from severe indisposition, was one of the principal guests and speakers. Dr. Heals presided, and the Swedish minister, Mr. Ljtton, was also present, Several of the orations, tnore especially those of Sir H. Bulwer, were of a remarkable character. Captain Cooper responded for the British army, Sir H. Bulwer for the Duke of Wellington, and Mr. Lytton for his father, the great novelist. Our accounts from New York, extending to the 291 h ult. (the usuill telegraphic despiltch via Halifax not having arrived), are important, announcing the arrest of a number of Hungarian refugees, &i\\, in New York, with a steamer and stores of ammunition, on the eve of embarkation to attempt a second time the revolution of Cuba. President Fillmore had issued it proclamation, denouncing the attempt, and for the pre-ent the plot would appear to be frustrated. It is stated in letters from New York that instructions had been received from the treasury department, direcring the revenue officers strictly to euforce the provisIons of lh., act of March 2, 1799. requiring, under a heavy penalty masters both of the United States and foreign vessels, on arriving within four leagues of the co^st, to have on board duplicate manifests of their cargoes. Our accounts from Havaunah, which extend to the 23rd ult., announce that much excitement continued to exist on account of the in-asi<>n, which Was expecled tu have landed on the 19th inst. The Captain-general had received a despatch, stating that an expedition had failed from New Orleans The troops were sleeping on their arms; horses were ready saddled for express, and It. s'eamer keeps her steam up.

BANVARD'S Grand Moving Panorama of the MISSIS- SIPPI, OHIO, and MISSOURI RIVERS, the same that was exhibited, by Special Command, before Her Majesty the Queen, II.R.B. Prince Albert, and the Court and Royal Family at Windsor Castle, and at the Egyp- tian Hall, Piccadilly, for a year and a half, where it was viewed by over Half a Million Persons. This magnificent Panorama of the Three Largest Rivers in North America pourtrnys accurately the River, Forest, and Prairie Scenery of the Great West, passing through nine States of the American Union and twelve degrees of latitude, from the Rocky Mountains and Yel- low Stone Bluffs of the Missouri, and Cincinnati, the Queen City of the West, on the Ohio, to the City of New Orleans, on the Mississippi, near the Gulf of Mexico; being by far the Largest Painting ever executed by man. It shows life on the Great Western Waters; the thriving Cities and Towns; the early Settler's Hut, or Log Cabin; the manner of clearing the land for cultivation; Indians Hunting Buffaloes; a Burning Forest; the immense Prairies of Grass; Cypress Swamps; the singular Steam Bouts, Flat Boats, Rafts, and other Water Craft of the Mississippi; a Prairie on Fire; Indian Village by Moon- light, &c., all combining to form a most instructive and entertaining Exhibition. The scenery of the magnificent Rivers in question is given with striking fidelity, and we are presented with, not only the features of the country, but with abundant pictures of human life as found on the Great Western Waters.\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBath Chronicle. This Panorama is beautifully executed. No one can pay a visit to this excellent Exhibition without receiving lully as much instruction as amusement. It is a valuable means of conveying a knowledge of distant scenery far more forcibly than by lectures or books.\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBristol Times. The Press, metropolitan as well as provincial, have been unanimous in their commendations of thisExhibition, and no one who visits it can fail to be impressed with the conviction of its excellence, aud that the praise bestowed upon it has been richly deserved. The Panorama is a lite-like illustration ot a voyage through these Great Risers of the Western Continent, and we sincerely advise our readers not to omit the opportunity of witnessing it.\" Bath Journal. \u00c2\u00b0 The Panorama will be exhibited in Cardiff for just Six Days, and positively no longer, as after that time it goe* to Merthyr.

Fauchei's minis'erial combination, it ill said that the President has resorted once more to his fa- vourite idea of choosing a cabinet outside the Assembly, ihe ministers to be mere administrative secretaries as in the United Stales. M. Waiss, Prefect of the Nord, is mentioned as likely to be charged, in accordaucf with this principle, with the ministry of the interior; M. Magne with Ihe financial department; GE'neral1tllu\u00c3\u00b9.on wilh the ministry of war; M.de Royer, proctireur of the Paris Court of Appeal, with that of justice, and other similar appointments. At the same time a message was to be addressed to the Assembly, containing a genuine republican profession of faith in answer to M. Thier's speech, and giving more decided pledges of adhesion to iheronftitn- tion than ever. But, it would be added, that above the constitution was the national will. MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdPARIS, Friday Evening.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdM. Dupin read in the Assembly, at tour o'clock to-day, the following message from the President of the Republic to the President of the Assembly;\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\"Public opinion, confiflillg in Ihe prudence I/f the Assembly IIntl the Government, has not been alarmed by the late inci- dents; nevertheless, France begins 10 suffer bydivistons which she deplores. My duty is to do what in me lies to prevent the ill results of them. The union of the two powers is indispensable to the repose of the country, but as the constitution has rendered them independent ot each other, the only condition of this union is reciprocal confi- dence. Penetrated wi, h this sentiment, I shall always respect the rights of the Assembly, while maintaining intact the prerogatives of that power which I holtl from the people. In order not to prolong a painful discussion, I have accepted, after the rccent vote of the Assembly, the resignation of a ministry which had given to the countiy and to the cause of order signal pledges of its devotion. Wishiug, however, to reconstruct n cabinet with chances ol (I it rat KHI I Co it lit not choose its elements ill a minority produced by exceptiouHble ciicumstances, and have found myself with regret unable to frame a combination from among the members of the minority, notwithstanding its im. portance. In this conjuncture, after vain attempts, I have resolved on forming a ministry of transition of special men, belonging to no fraction of the Assembly, and deter- mined to devote tbemeetree to siTdirs, without regard to party feeling and the honourable men who accept this patriotic task will Lave tides to the gratitude of the country. The adniibislrution will, therefore, continue as before; prejudices will be dissipated before a remem- brance of the solemn declaration of November 12. The real majority will be reconstituted. Harmony \"ill be re-established without the two powers having sacrificed aught of the dignity which constitutes thrir strength. France, before all things, desires repose, and expects from thost- whom she has invested with her conliJetice concilia- tion without weakness \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd calm and unaltered firmness in theright. Accept, M. le President, the assurances of a high esteem. Louis NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.\" The message was listened to throughout without inter- ruption, the attitude of the Assembly being cool aud calm. The new ministry is as follows: General ILmdon, War; Waiss, Interior; Germiny, Finance; Magne, Public WOIKS; Brennier, Foreign Affairs; Royer, Justice; Vailliant, Marine Gii aud, Public 1 ns'ruction Schneider, Agriculture and Commerce. None of these are repre- sentatives. Germiny was Receiver-General at Rome. Giraud, the Inspector General ot Universities; Schneider, the manager of Iron-works at Creuzot. The Moiiitfiir announces that in coospquence of a do- mestic calamity the President's ball, which was stated to have coaie oil on Thursday last, has been postponed. This domestic calamity is the Ilealll ot Madame Laitz (nee Beau- haruais), a daughter ot the late Marquess de Beauharnais. SPAIN.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMADRID, JAN. 18. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Explanations having been demanded of M.

Generals Pavia and Serrano are said to he destined to important commands. AUSTRIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOur advices from Vienna are of the 24th instant. They contain the positive statement that M de Schmerling's resigaation has been accepted by the Em peror. M.

Howes, after a remarkably quick run ot 15 j days lrom Boston, we have received accounts from that city of the 10th, and from New York to the 9th instant, inclusive. Duriug her passage the Revere encountered heavy westerly gales.- The Uuited States mail steamer Washington, Capt-iin Floyd, arrived out at New York on the 8,h instant. Sue left Cowes on the 21st of December\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthree days before the Atiautic departed from Liverpool.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Boston Atlas of the 10th announces that the Royal steam-ship Niagara had been seized for a violation of the revenue laws of the Uniied States. We question the accuracy of thf report, and are at least satisfied that the affair wiil uot delay the shiv's departure on the 15th instant willi the nsual mails for this port. Our accounts are, politically, of no import- ance. Since the Baltic's departure, Congress had not transacted any business of European interest, and our files are almost exclusively occupied by messages from the Governors ol Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, &c. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd From the Philadelphia journals we learn that the aunuatmcs- sage of Governor Jo iustone was delivered to the Penll- 8ylvaniH\\ Legislature Oil the 8th instant. The, message stated that theactual indebtedness ol the State on the 30.li ofNovetubertast .was 40.310091 dollars. It has tteen diminished a little more than Ilalr a million since the 8 JIb of November, IS48. The treasury receipts during the past year were 4,438,131 dollars; the payments were 4,558,193 dollars. The message recommended a system of banking founded on State stocks. It also discussed the Fugitive Slave Law, and came to the conclusion that it was the duty of every citizen to obey its provisions. He objected, hoyvever, to some of its provisions, and main- tained lhat they ouuht to be amended.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdFrom Canada and Mexico we have no later advices.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdFrom Turk's Island we learn that her Majesty's screw steamer Plumper sailed from Grand Turk on the 2Htb of November for St. Domingo, for the protection of British subjects and pro- perty in that island.

NEW YORK, JAN. 1G, 7 P.M. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMr. Clay yesterday earnestly advocated in the Senate the bill for establishing a line of Government steamers for transp >ri iujr negroes to the coast of Africa.

THE PROGRESS OF AMERICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe have just read a few returns of the ne.v American censns -of such unuslnl significance that we doubt whether far-seeing rueu will not regard them as more interesting than the tiuest revolution abroad or the foulest murder \u00c2\u00bbt home. The American census is not yet complete; hut the returns already re- ceived point to conclusions far beyond hope or expectation. Look at New York, lor instance.

Bat the populatinn is now said to have risen to the astonishing number of 750.00J There are but two larger cities in Eurojie; in ten years more at the same rate of progress, it will be larger than Paris. In thirty years from this date New York will, on the same terms, be larger than London. And it must be considered that the commercial capital of America is not fed, like our Manchester and Liverpool, at the expense of the country; its arlvance is tile Iype of that [If IIn enlire cnolinent.

So far as the generalllature of the return can be interred from tll\" data at hand, the populatioll of the U niun will be about 25,000,000. From the year ISOO, when the number was a little more than 5,000,000, to 1840, when it had advanced to 17,000,000, the decennial rate of in- crease was about thirty-three per cent.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. THE FRENCH REPUBLIC. On Monday week the Assembly resumed its sittings and about 500 representatives were present, but no solemnity accompanied the event, and the proceed- ings were, for the most part, of merely a formal cha- racter Conversation was mostly on a strange hoax of the Presse about the President's Message, that journal having published a document entitled the Message of the President of the Republic to the Legislative Assembly,\" and signed L. N. Bonaparte. People stared at first to see this extraordinary appa- rent forestalment of an official dotument which had not yet been submitted to the presses of the national printing office, and which was known to be guarded with the most jealous secresy. A little inspection shewed the thing to be a hoax. Under the successive heads of internal policy, taxes and budgets, laborious classes, agriculture, industry, commerce, instruction, laws. The most radical principles appeared clothed in a rhetoric garb unknown to the official school. Still it was not easy to account for the name of the Presi- dent being attached. The fact is that M. Girardin had got together a heap of pamphlets published at various epochs by M. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, and ( taking a pair of scissors, cut out and wafered together this piece of patchwork, significant of the changes which have come over the mind of Louis N^'olopn since he has been installed in the presidei). chair. An official communication f o ;i% EJysee io >< ^eral of the papers declaring it a .ery. THE Prucureur of the Republic caused the ;rnal to be sthzed at the post and its offices for the public/it i or the article, and a prosecution has been institute. Several tele- graphic despaches were received inquiring as to its authenticity. On Tuesday, after the election of the President of the Assembly, the President's Message was read, which will be found in our fourth page. Count de Montalembert, member of the French Assembly has arrived at Rome, on, it is believed, a mission from the President of the French Republic. The Paris Court of Assize has condemned the editor of the Mode to three months imprisonment and 2,000f. for publishing an article insulting to the President to the Republic. SPAIN. MADRID, Nov. 7.-In the Chamber of Deputies, yesterday, an unpleasant incident occurred Senor Madoz having accused the Ministry of interfering in the elections in such a manner as to drive away several distinguished members of the opposition, the Minister of the Interior denied this on the part of the Government, upon which Senor Madoz, seized with sudden passion, rose, and in an emphatic manner said, Senor President, I renounce the office of deputy,\" and quitted the chamber, in which he did not make his appearance to-day. The other members of the opposition were present as usual. PRUSSIA\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdINTERVENTION IN HESSE. Late intelligence, dated the 12th, from Berlin, state that the pacific news is in part confirmed by the statement that the Prussian Ambassador at Vienna is on the point of settling all matters in dispute, and that on the whole the differences now remaining are very slight. No measures have been taken to supply the vacancies in the King of Prussia's Cabinet. This slackness aroused the suspicions and provoked the animadversions of the Liberal press. It was. however, rumoured that the Prince of Solmslych was likely to take the Presidency of the Cabinet. The Prince of Prussia supported the promotion of Prince Solmslych to that post. Large masses of troops and Landwchr are still passing through the Rhenish provinces. They are moving to the south. The whole of the Prussian, army is now on a war footing, and the Order in Council of the 6th inst. is completely executed. Our advices from Frankfort and Cassel are of the 12th inst. The general impression at Frankfort was against the probability of a war. A rumour was current that the Prussian troops would evacuate the city of Cassel. From the information we have received this morning we learn that this rumour was unfounded. The head-quarters of the Prussian army are at Friedewald, midway between Vacha and Hersfeld. The latter place has a Prussian garrison. This position covers the roads to Thuringia and Cassel. A reinforcement of Prussian troops was expected from IMarburg. From Munich we learn that measures are still taken to complete the mobilization of the Bavarian army. The 16 regiments of foot will have a fourth battalion to each regiment. The Austrian part of the garrison of Maintz is completing and restoring the fortifications of that place. A rumour has come into circulation that the military convention between Prussia and Baden is to be discontinued, This reversal of former measures is assribed to the new Cabinet of the Gran I Duke of Baden. Large masses of Russian troops are moving to the west. It would appear that these troops are intended to occupy the eastern provinces of Austria, if a war with Prussia should really take place. TURKEY. Letters from Constantinople, under date of Nov. 2, state that a riot against the Christian population has broken out at Aleppo. A multitude of Franks were killed, and their houses sacked and burnt. The Turkish soldiers remained quiet spectators of these outrages. INDIA AND CHINA. We have received by electric telegraph, via Trieste the following summary of Indian intelligence, in anticipation of the overland mail :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe dates of the last advices were Hong Kong, September 27 Cal cutta, October 8; Bombay, October 17. No event of political importance had occurred in India Proper since the departure of the last mail. The hill tribes on the Kohat frontier were again manifesting a hostile disposition, and the passage through their defiles was interrupted. It is again announced that the works on the Bombay Railway had been com- menced. Disaffection and mutinies among the Nizam's native regiments still continue. The Go- vernor-General was on the point of departing for Peshawur. From Hong Kong we learn that the insurgents were getting the better of the Imperial troops. Numerous bands of robbers were plundering and burning throughout the province of Kangsi and Canton, and after the capture of the city of Kintschan the insurgents had advanced to within 120 English miles of Canton. BORNEO. Intelligence had reached Singapore of a victory gained by the Dutch over the Chinese in the Sombas river, in Borneo, after a. bloody engagement. It was reported that Sir James Brooke's mission to Siam had proved an utter failure. AMERICA. The steamer Asia, Captain Judkins, arrived at Liverpool on Sunday morning, at eight o'clock, with dates and advices, from New York direct, to the 6th inst. inclusive. She brings 93 passengers, a full freight, and \u00c2\u00a3 46,5CO in specie. The Pacific arrived at an early hour on the 2nd, and the Africa was spoken by the Asia on the morning of tlie 7th, about 300 miles from New York. The political news is still of but little moment. The elections for the city of New York had taken place, and, notwithstanding the excitement upon the Fugitive Slave Bill, had been conducted with a spirit of great moderation. The Vv higs were high in the majority for all the offices contended for and Mr. Kingsland, a well-known Whig, has been elected mayor. Of members of Assembly, the Whigs have elected 13 out of 16. For Congress, however, the Courier is of opinion that the Whigs will be in a mi- nority. For New Orleans we have accounts of another great arrival from California. The Alabama arrived at New Orleans upon the 1st inst., with 10S passen- gers and nearly 3,000,000 dollars in gold. \\Ve learn that a most distructive fire had occurred at San Francisco, previous to the sailing of the Alabama, by which p.operty to the amount of 500,000 dollars had been destroyed. Jenny Mad Still continues to delight the Ameri- cans. She is to give a series of concerts in the Far West, previous to ber European visitation, under the auspices of Mr, Burnam.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Paris papers of Friday state that much excitement existed that morning relative to an interview in England between M. Berryer, M. Bonoist d'Any, and M. de St. Priest, with the widow of Louis Philippe, the Duke de Nemours, and the Prince de Joinville, with a view to a fusion of the two branches of the Bourbons. The\" Orore\" affirms that the Queen and the two Princes, whilst professing the most concilia- tory sentiments, declared that they would submit to what- ever decision France as a free State might come to.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt is announced in lettelsfrom Rome that the Pope does not intend to return to his capital from Castel Gandolfo, until he shall have some better guarantee against revolu- tion than the presence of a French army. At Castel Gandolfo he has always the means of escape, for in a few- hours he would be under the protection of the Neapolitans. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe report of the Revision Committee, drawn up by M. de Tocqueville, and read to the Assembly as the groundwork of the coming debate, has earned for its author considerable praise, which, as a composition, it deserves. M. de Tocqueville is a cautious and moderate politician. He has closely watched the progress of public opinion, and his analytic acuteness has enabled him to give a most luminous exposi of a state of public affairs which renders it extremely difficult to find a balance of reason in favour of any one course that can be suggested over any other. It is not his fault that there is sornelhing whimsical about his most effective argu- ment. The Constitution must be revised, not so much because it needs revision, as because the present As- sembly and the President will politically expire nearly at the same moment; and some other power, capable of imposing on the imagination and commanding the respect of the people, will be wanted during the practical interregnum occasioned by the decrepitude of the old legislature, and the infancy of the new. Not but what the Constitution has its defects, which will give decent employment to the proposed Constituent. M. de Tocqueville instances two, one of which may be easily mended tbe other \\tbe\" perpetual tete-a-tete, as he describes it, between President and Assembly, which experience has shown to be so fertile in jealousies and disputes), appears to be inherent in every constitution which includes an elected President and an elected Legis- lature. The report contains other felicitous passages, as where he describes the French nation as more continually in need of being governed, and yet more impatient of Government than any other civilized people; and where he points out the advantage which, on every Presidential election, the actual holder of power, whether lawfully re- eligible or not. will always have over all competitors. The wisdom of the general drift of the report as a political move is more open to question, and seems to be doubt- fully regarded in France. M. de Tocqueville recom- mends, in order to get the President safely out, the re- vision which the people are calling for, mainly if not solely, to keep him ill. Among other odds and ends of foreign intelligence we learn that Saldanha is not quite a Dictator at Lisbon, where he has some difficulty in forming a respectable Cabinet; and that the Republics of the Plate are at last combining in earnest to eject Rosas from Buenos Ayres. SPAIN.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA project of laws for the settlement of the Spanish debt, is announced, by telegraphic despatch from Madrid, to have passed on the 14th inst., by 154 votes to 52. AUSTRIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt is stated that M. de Bruck is about to be despatched to England on a confidential mission, with a view of arranging a reciprocal free trade between the two countries. PRUSSIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Berlin Gazette of July 12, an- nounces that France and England have protested at Frankfort against the continuance of the Prussian pro- vinces and of Posen iu the Confederation, as also against the total incorporation of Austria:- \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2\u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 Prussia herself desires the separation of the Prussian pro- vinces and of Posen; but in concert with Austria, slie has de- clared that this question, as well as that of the total incorpo- ration of the last named power, are two internal cjuestioas or Germauy, and that no foreign power has a right to interfere. The Hamburgh Correspondent says that Prussia will support in the Frankfort Diet the protest of the Duke of Augustenburg against his attainder by the King of Denmark. ITALY.- The Pope left Rome on the 2d. inst. for Castel Gandolfo, instead of waiting as usual for the autumn to set in. This move has renewed the rumour of the intended abdication of his Holiness, but in all pro- bability without foundation. A meeting with the King of Naples is the most likely solution, his Majesty having immediately followed the Pontiff with all his children, even the last born to receive the Pope's benediction. AM ERICA. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLIVERPOOL, SUNDAY NIGHT. By the Royal mail steamer Niagara, Captain Stone, we have advices from New York to the 2nd instant. She brings 951,000 dollars in specie on freight, 128,000 dollars of which are for Havre. The Africa arrived at New York on the morning of the 2nd illst. The steam-ship Her- mann arrived at New York on the 2nd inst. shortly after the Europa. Much interest had been excited in New York by a requisition from Mr. Butwer, the British Minister to the United Government, for the extradition of a deserter from the British army in New Brunswick. The accused was charged with stealing sundry arms and equipments in order to make his offence indictable under the conditions of the treaty. He is a man of some intel- ligence, and conducted his own cause at the primary examination with a good deal of shrewdness. The decision of the court has not beeu tendered.

The deposits are said to be of the same character as Cali- fornia, but purer. A respectable resident in the coun. try writes:- They are discovering every day new and immensely rich veins of gold, but from one mine alone, which is several yards wide, and which is partly owned by a distant relation of mine they have got out already 21,.0.0.0 quintals of ore, which will yield an amount of from 20iJ,OOJ, to 250,000 dollars in gold.

The organ of the colonists has already done good service to them in En. gland, by commanding the admiration and respect of its mighty namesake, the Thunderer at home, and leading to a better appreciation of the colony by our contempo- rary than it was at one time disposed to afford. By the Lyttelton 1 imes of Saturday, February 22, we learn that the colonists had appointed the following day for special thanksgiving to Almighty God for His great mercy in bringing the first body of the colonists of this settlement in safety to their new country, and for the blesaiugs which has hitherto attended their undertaking.

As they progressed on their road, they are said to have upbraided each other in terms not the most gentle lor not bearing a fair share of the burthen and occasionally they took a rest by placing the bier in the road, and then sitting down on the coffin!

GERMANY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Cotogne Gazette,' states that ac- cording to Austrian correspondence, the Diet will open at Frankfort on the 12th of May, and that the entry of Aus.ria with all her states into the confede- ration will form the first subject of discussion. PRUSSIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe correspondent of the Daily News' writes as follows, under date May 6ih \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Prince Schwarzenberg is, it appears, determined to make another attempt to prevent the Dresden conferences from separating wiriout a result. He has drawn up a proposition in reference to the manner in which the federal business is conducted, in which he will, ac- cording to the Austrian papers, endeavour to procure a unanimous resolution of the plenipotentiaries as- sembled in Dresden. The proposition iiasbeencom- municated to the German governments by a circular no:e. One of the six points refers to the vexed ques tion of the veto possessed by each sta'e, which Prince Schvvaizenberg wishes to put down, and to introduce in its place decisions by majorities. This point is one on which the smaller states will prove tenacious, for they have learned with dismay that, neglected by Prm's: I, Aus'ria is inclined to protect ti.em only so long as they give way to the bayonet rule of her government. The withdrawal of ll\u00c2\u00bbe veto from the minor states would deprive the princes of their deeply cherished ereign rights, in fact, degrade them to the Jerel heir mediatised colleagues. Were the ajcendun wer in the confederation, a progressive, civilising testat)t state, the abolition of the veto and the i. luction of majority decisions would be highly beneficial to Germany, but as unhappily the only powerful state in Germany by which the neces- sary principles can be put in practice has yielded in the struggle for political ascendancy, as Piussia has not only laid down her arms before despotic Austria, and is following the innate tendencies to despotic governnientof the ultra-reactionary party in the coun- try\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe possession of the veto by the smaller princes \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdabsurd as it is-must be protected, as the only means of resisting the downward motion. In Dres- den, as much as in, Frankfort, unanimity is necessary to give life and strength to any proposition. Prince Schwarzenberg will, most probably be defeated, and the miserable, helpless machinery of the old Bunde- stag be res'ored in its old form. The few men of liberal opinions in Prussia who still trouble their heads with the slough of German politics pray most earnestly for the maintenance of the veto, though but a year ago it was an object of abhorrence. So st.angely do circumstances alter opinions. DENMAUK. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Disturbances took place at Copen- iiagen in the evening of the 4th. Bitter enmity has aiw-sys existed between the Germans and the Danes, and it has been increased by the war in Schleswig. Two Danish sailors, on passing the stiopofa Prus- sian bi ushmaker, threw stones at the windows, and broke five squares. The tradesman, aided by his workmen, seized ihern, and dragged them into the shop. There the sailors offered to pay the damage but the tradesman said they deserved to be punished and sent for the guard. The sol,liers took off the sailors m custody. But a crowd assembhd before the house, and cried, Down with the Germans 1 down with the enemies of the country away with die barbarians and about twenty men entered the the Prussian a severe beating, and smashed everything they could lay hands on. Ano- ther crowd followed the sailors, ard made frecpierit attempts to deliver them. The prisoners, however, were lodged in the lock-up, but the crowd made an attack on it, and disregarded the summons of the ofheer of tiie guard to dispeisc. At last the officer ordered his men to present their muskets, and as the crowd still refused to go away he gave the oider to fire. Only six soidiers obeyed, and five men were wounded. The people then slowly disposed. The crowd who had assembled before the Prussian's shop took him to prison. Although there was no charge against him he was locked up to prevent any more injury from being done him but he was shortly afier set at liberty. THE CAPE OF GOOD LIOFE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Hellespont, Genera! Screw Steam Navigation Company's vessel, Captain Watts, arrived at Plymouth on Friday morn- ing, from the Cape of Hope, with mails, passengers, and a general cargo. She has made her passage home fiom the Cape in 34 days, 18 hours, being the quickest voyage yet made by any screw steam- vessel. The intelligence from the Cape shows matters to be almost in a state of statu quo. Sir Harry Smith was still on the frontier, and a large Kaffir force was stiil inarms. The state of feeling at the Cape con- tinued to wear an anti-English aspect, and it was thoughtby persons long resident in the Cape colony that there was very little chance of a termination of the war witli the Kaiffrs for an age. But little, if any, progress can be said to have been made in the war during the month. Sir Harry Smith was still wait- ing for at, accession ofstiennth by the arrival of fresh troops. In the interim, the spirit of disaffection had spread from the public to the army, and a number of Hottentot natives in the Cape Mounted Rifles had deserted. Ihe latest news by the Propontis was that of the capture of Fort Armstrong, and the suppression of the rebeiiion in the Kat River settlement. Since then no other equally important success has been achieved; but, on the contrary, some rather serious misfortunes have been experienced. On the very day on which the Kat River rebels were defeated \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd the 22nd of February\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda colonial force suffered a lamentable reverse at a place about 150 miles to the north of that settlement. Thiswas in the Wittebergen, or White Mountains, on the ex- tren.e north-eastern frontier of the colony. Mr. Cole, civil commissioner of the Albert Division, with a patrol of about 120 men, advanced into the country of a Tambookie chief, named Morosi, whgse fidelity was suspected, with the purpose of bringing him tl) terms. The patrol was suddenly assailed on all sides by an overwhelming force of Kaffirs; 9 Eng- lish volunteers, 11 Hottentots, and 8 Fingoes weie killed, and 16 Fingoes wounded. The survivors of the detachment owed their escape, to the prompt advance of a reinforcement from the camp of Major Warden, British resident in the Orange River Sove- reignty, who had crossed the river with a body of troops to ass,st Mr. Cole. The forces in British KafTraria, under the imme- diate command of Sir Harry Smith, have been em- | ployed, with little intermission, in marching and coun- termarching through that province. The ostensible objects of these operations have been to disperse par- ties of the enemy, to supply the forts with provisions, to capture cattle, and !o lay waste the enemy's country Two or three thousand head of caltle have been taken, some huts burned, and a considerable number of Kaffirs killed m several encounters. On the 6th inst, Col. Mackinnon, with a force of about 2,500 men, cll iefly i i ot tentot Levies, routed and dispersed a large body of Kaffirs, who attempted to seize some pro- vision waggons which he was escorting. More than a hundred of the enemy were seen to fall. The loss on our side was one soldier of the 73rd Regiment, and two men of the levies killed and two wounded, ihe real object of these movements is supposed to be to mure the new levies to military discipline and the habits of border waifare. An unfortunate event took place at head quarters King William's Town, on the 12th ultimo. A con- siderable number of the men of the Cape Mounted Rifles had been known for some time to be in a state of disaffection, owing chiefly to the r connexion with the Kat River llottentots, On the night of the day above mentioned, forty-six men of that corps, in- cluding three sergeants, together with a few Hot- tentots of the Graham's Town levy, and the mule tram, deserted, taking with them their arms and bag- gage, but not their horses. It was found necessary, on the following day, to disarm the remainder of the corps, and to form a body of 100 mounted men from the western levies. The defection of the Cape corps is said to have greatly inspirited the Raffirs, Sir Harry Smith hav- ing received intelligence that an attack was to be made upon Fort Hare, moved fiom King William's Town, on the lfcSth ultimo, with, a force of about 2,500 men, to the support of General Somerset. On his way from Fort White to Fort Hare, on the 19ih, he was attacked by a large body of Kaffirs, who were repulsed and routed, with the loss of 40 or 50 killed, including three of the deserters from the Cape corps. On our iide only cue man of the levies was wounded. Having accomplished the object of his movement Sir Harry left Fort Hare on the 21st ult., for King William's Town, where he was expected to arrive ou the 28th. A court-martial has been assembled at Fort Hare for the trial of some of the prisoners who have been captured during the operations against the rebels. The trials were still proceeding at the last accounts. A proclamation was published in the Govern- ment of the 27th ult calling out a force of 309 mounted burghers (including 9 burgher officers) for a service of six months, if they shall be so long required. Proper arrangements are to be made for their conveyance to and from the seat of war, and for their remuneration while in service. Intelligence, of the 14th ult., has been received from Natal, to the effect that the order for the ad- vanc? of seve'al thousand Fatal Zulus overland, t aid in subduing ihe Kaffirs, was understood to have been repeated. The filst order, given shortly after the outbreak of the war, was countermanded, in consequence of the alarm and disturbance which it excited at Natal; the renewed order appears to have caused still greater consternation among the colonists. UMTED STATEs.-The royal mail steamer Ame- rica, Captain Shannon, arrived at Liverpool on Mon- day morning, with the usual mails from the United States, Canada, &c-, 111 passengers, and 26,000/. in specie. The United States government have taken prompt steps to prevent ancther Cuban invasion. A formal complaint has been made by the Mexican government to the President of the United Slates In relation to the Indian outrages on the frontier of Mexico against which, by the terms of the treaty the United Stales agreed iO protect her. Congress having failed at the late session to make the appropriation asked by the war department ior the duty, the service has not been performed; and 2 Mexico now refuses to ratify the Tchuantepee treaty unless the provisions of the treaty of peace are first fulfilled. At Havana the most intense excitement prevailed with regard to another invasion, and so confidently was it expected that the troops were ordered to sleep on their arms, and be ready for marching at a mo- ment's warning. The vessels of war in port have been ordered to be ready for action. Advices from Hayti furnish a more connected ac- count of the recent plot to overthrow the imperial government and re-establish the republic.

{"ocr": "Foreign Intelligence, FRANCE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Paris correspondent of the 'Daily N tW,' writing on Wednesday se'nnight, says:- To-day M. de Lamartine has read a lesson out of history to the legitimists, which has created an im- mense sensation. Inis remarkable ariicle, one of the most powerful conpositions that have yet appeared f.om his pen, declares th-it the open defiance cast by the legitimists at the republic calls for a pacific 18th Fructidor. W lien the royal club of Clicliy con- spired against the directory, the government of that day, seeing that the republic was lost if the coup-de- main of the Piehegrus and monks of the moment were not arrested, pounced on the Clichy conspirators, and packed them and their generals off to Cayenne. Now the royalists of that day had some excuse for conspiring. It was natural that they should seize the moment when reaction was filling the high places with their tools, to mature their plans. But what Lave tne royalists of the present day to complain of The republic of 1843 has not harmed the hair of one of their heads, and for this mild tieatment, before the eml of t!ie first shoit niagistra.ure, they turn round upon it with insolent menace and utter defiance. Ihese men, to whom the republic has given so large a share of power, use their footing to deal a blow at the protectress which stood between them and their deadly foes. They will not hear of partial revision; they will have nothing less than a return of the mo- narchy. What, is this the answer of M- Berryer to that people who made so moderate a use of their victory, so generous an application of univeisal suf- frage ? I Live the legitimists lost their wits, to sup- pose that, with two departments in the south, and four \u00c3\ufffdr five in the west, they can measure themselves against the remaining 80 departments and three thou- sand large and small towns against the populations of industrious cities, which have only to change their tools for bayonets to enable them to turn out immense armies for the protection of their liberties. Such defiance is mere suicide. But let the government awake up out of its torpid slumber; let it profit by the example of Hoche and Bonaparte, and deal with the new Clichy Club accordingly. Let the 18th Fructidor of 1851 be a pacific one. Tlie government hos only to abolish the law of May to appoint republican mi- nisters to disavow all idea of competing for the pre- sidency of 18.52 and to propose the partial revision of the constitution. lean only give you this feeble outline of an article which will produce a great effect throughout France. On Thursday a grand review of the whole garrison was held in the Champ de Mars. The charges of cavalry were on a scale unusually grand, the front of the galloping brigade extending completely across the immense plain. One unfortunate diagoon lay spraw- ling behind on the dusty field, and immediately the President and his staff gallopped up to inquire about the poor fellow. The President was in his usual costume of ge- neral of the national guard, with the broad ribbon of the legion of honour. General Narvaez, de- corated with the same order, rode at his side. After the troops had filed off, as the President and his staff rode out of the inclosure to the bridge, he was re- ceived by loud and repeated cries of Vive Napo- leon Vive I' Empereur\" was also uttered by a j few. The republic seemed to have for the represen- tative of its credit in that quarter only a solitary cab driver, whose single exclamation met with no encou- ragement. On Monday evening, the Club of the Rue des Pyratnides, in its sitting, adopted the following reso ILitioii Tire undersigned representatives of the people, with the object of appealing to the nation for the full exercise of its sovereignty, declare themselves in favour of the revision of the constitution. This proposition is signed by 182 members. The Electoral Union has adopted the following form of petition Representatives\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe constitu- tion itself has fixed the period of its revision; the moment is come for you to deliberate on this grave question. To the eyes of all the friends of order, without exception, the defects of the constitution are demonstrated. To it are to be imputed the sufferings of the present and the dangers of the future. Re- presentatives, we respectfully request you to decide that the constitution be revised.\" In the departments the petitionary movement takes a more decided colour, and pronounces directly either in favour of the prolongation of the President's powers, or the restoration of the legitimate monarchy. 'Flie I Lebats,' in a long article upon the question i of the day, says that it advocates revision as a disa- vowal and retractation of the revolution of February It does not regard tne dynastic side of the question,' but the political side. What it wants is a good republican government, a couple of chambers, and a strong executive. The I Co,-istitutionel' tias broken silence at length on the decided declaration of the cabinet in favour of the law of May. The organ of M. Guizot is shocked at the President having made an application to the Roman Govern- ment in favour of Charles Bonaparte, Prince of Can ino, in order that he may be permitted to visit Rome for a fortnight for the settlement of his family affairs, and the removal of Ins wife. Tlie President is scolded foe not treating his cousin with the same rigour which met with the applausa of the parliament when he closed to the Prince of Canino the doors of France. A special steamer, the Eclaireut-, has been sent with important despatches to General Gemeau. The instru tion of these despatches have been motived by the intrigues of Cardinal Antonelli with Austria and urge General Gemeau, to occupy and fortify Monte Mario, and the points of vantage-ground about Rome. M. Chavoix, representative, has been condemned by the tribunal of Perigneux to pay a fine of 30,000 francs to the family of M. Dupont, whom he killed in a duel. The battalion of Chasseurs de Vincennes, just ordered to Rome, is a corps of those formidable sharpshooters who did such terrible execution at the siege of Rome by picking off the Roman gunners; Their missile, instead of a ball, is a cylinder, with a conical tip, which is carried by the rifles an immense distance with fearful precision. The men are picked with great care from the nimblest and most quick- sighted, and are generally small and square set. It was by a chasseur of Vincennes that Laveyron, the French sympathiser, was shot in the forehead as he peered a moment over the Roman wall. The following semi-official article in the Bulletin- de Paris,' upon the instructions sent to Gen. Gemeau, is worthy of attention, as it indicates a diversion in favour of liberalism on the part of the French go- vernment, and the firm intention of detaching the Pope from Antonelli and the Jesuits, and setting his Holiness, with polite constraint, on the way of those reforms which have of late become so unpalatable to him The instructions which have been sent to General Gemeau, commanding the French corps of occupa- tion at Rome, are very energetic and very explicit. They are favourable to the z, pontifical government; they assure protection to Pope Pius IX., and have for special aim the security of our army. Italy is at the present moment in a state of ferment which might become dangerous were not the attitude of our flag strong and lofty before the country and before Eu- rope. There is talk of a great military movement in Naples, the aim of which is not known. General Gemeau has provided the means for maintaining tranquillity in Rome and the nighbouring provinces, as well as for resisting all attempts on the part of the demagogic faction. The public may be assured on this point. Our diplomacy will, at the same time, know how to foil such wicked intrigues as have no support from the moderate party, and which are dis- approved of by the liberal wisdom of the Pope. Severe ;epressive measures have already caused the cessation of the agitations and criminal acts which have for some time been observed in Rome. What- ever apperis, our tioops have nothing to fear at ome. General Gemeau has taken such precautions r T s,uJrprise or \u00c2\u00bbUaekis to be feared. 12,000 Menc so iers, well supplied, need fear nothing in a town where 111 1814, General Miollis, with a few hundred conscripts, could hold the Castle of St. Ange o for three months, in presence of an insurgent population and an army of 50,000 Neapolitans. trance has undertaken a glorious work in re-estab lishing ^'e sovereign pontiff on his throne, over- turned by demagogie; she will accomplish that work by maintaining him upon that throne, venerated by all Christendom, and at the same time assuring to the population of his states the benefits of a liberal intervention. SPADL-It is said that the ministerial candidate for the Presidency of the Chamber of Deputies will be M. Maynans. The candidate of the old moderado opposition will be M. Mon. A telegraphic message from Madrid, dated the 0 24th, announces that the Marquis Miiafloies has been named Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Espana,' organ of Queen Christina, contains a violent attack upon Lord Palmerston, taking for its text a letter of congratulation alleged to have been addressed by Sir G. II. Seymour to the Duke de Saldanha, at Oporto. The letter in question is said to have been sent by the British war steamer Daunt- less, which returned to Lisbon with an aide-de-can.p of Saldanha. Sir G. 11. Seymour is accused in this aititle of playing at Lisbon the same game as Sir B. Bulwer at Madrid. A mixed commission is to be appointed by the French and Spanish governments for the settlement of the Pyrenean frontier. Several Cailist chiefs, old officers of Don Carlos, having paid a visit to the neighbourhood of Gerona, to be present at the festival of the patron saint, were sin rounded by a party of gendarmes and shot. The morning prints contain the letter of condolence sent by Espartero to the Queen-Mother, on the oc- casion of the late accident. This letter has very much displeased the progresista party, and has been much sneeied at by the moderados, who, though they affect to respect the Queen-Mother, are tuo sensible that it is her exigencies that form the principal d.ffi- culties in the government of the country. The letter is as follows:- Madam,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMy due adhesion to the person of the Queen-Mother, and the respectful sympathy with which my heart and loyalty take part in the pleasures and pains of my Queen, impose on me the duty of representing to your Majesty my affliction on hearing of the unfortunate accident which your Majesty suf- fered on the 8ill inst. May God speedily vouchsafe your return to good health, and to the embraces of your daughter. Accept, madam, with yonr natural benevolence, this expression of my sincere wishes for the happiness of your Majesty and all your royal famdy.-The Duke of Victoria. PORTUr,.i,L.-Tiie D,ike of Saldanha left Oporto with a portion of his \"army of Regeneration,\" amounting to about three thousand, in six steam transports, and landed at Lisbon on the 15th instant, amidst the most enthusiastic applause. The occa- sion seems to have been observed as a general holiday. 'I'lie duke, leaviii,, his Iroops on board the steamers, proceeded to pay a visit to the Queen, and was greeted during his progress with the most hearty I I y welcome. The troops having been landed, were formed in order in the great square, and the duke afterwards proceeded once more to the Palace, as well as to the Foreign Office, where he had an inter. view with Sir Hamilton Seymour. In the evening the Queen and King visited the Opera, but were indifferently received not so, how- ever, the Duke, who was greeted with loud vivas. In spite of all these favourable circumstances, Sal- danha had not been able to form a ministry, owing to the opposition of the ultra members of the Sep- tembrista party. lie had, therefore, placed himself at the head of the previously existing transition mi- nistry, filling in his own person the offices of Presi- dent of the Council, Minister of the Interior, and Minister of War. The 1st regiment had been brought up to Lisbon from Oporto on the 19th to strengthen his hands. The affairs of the country appear to be in as miserable a condition as possible, with a strong spirit of a revolutionary character abroad. Letters from Lisbon announce that the King has applied to the Queen for leave to pay a visit of three months to Germany. It was for some time doubled that her Majesty would accept the resignation of the King as Com- mander-in-Chief, but rather keep him in the com- mand of the army, as a focus of intrigue. The following copy of the letter of the Queen to him is a curious document for an English reader: \"Most high and most powerful prince and lord, Don Ferdinand, King of Portugal, Duke of Saxe Coburg Gotha, Marshal-General, Commander-in- Chief of the Army, my much loved, prized, and dear husband, I, Donna Maria, by the grace of God, Queen of Portugal, the Algarves, and their domi- nions, send to your Majesty much greeting, as him who above all I love and esteem. Taking into con- sideration what your Majesty has represented to me, and assenting to the solicitations that you address to me, I am well pleased to exonerate your Majesty from the command in chief of the army, which, by royal letter of the 17th of October, 1845, it was my pleasure to confide to the care of your Majesty. Most high and most powerful prince and lord, Don Ferdinand, King of Portugal, Duke of Saxe Coburg Gotha, Marshal-General, my much loved, prized, and dear husband, may our Lord continually protect the august person of your Majesty. Written in the Palace of Necessidades, the 7th day ai the month of May, 1851.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdYour Majesty's dear spouse (signed), MARIA. Counter-signed, Baron DE FRANcos.\" ITALY.-Naptes.-A letter from Naples of the 14th says,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAt Reggio, the other day, a political pri- soner made his escape into the woods, and having been discovered by the authorities, defended himself and wounded a soldier. He was eventually captured, and condemned to be decapitated. The cruelty ob- served towards this unhappy man is revolting in the extreme; after being beaten about the town of Reg- gio by the soldiers, he was driven to the guillotine, and there kept with the knife suspended over his head for ten minutes before it fell! An hour afterwards a royal pardon arrived by the ordinary post. Another singular circumstance has taken place in the city of Naples, of the Radcliife school. Some workmen employed in repairing an old public build- ing, the Prefettura Vecchia, on clearing away a wall, discovered a vacuum, in which a skull was deposited, together with a letter. The astonished artisans, as il usual here on all extraordinary occasions, immediately sent for the police. The functionaries arrived with M. Campo Basso, a notorious court chief of the de- partment, and proceeded to examine the mystery, when, strange to say, the flooring fell in, and buried some ten or twelve of his Majesty's most valuable servants. All were eventually rescued more dead IV than alive, Csmpo Basso having received injuries which may prove fatal to that celebrated persecutor of opinion. Such an event in a superstitious coun- try like Naples gives rise to the wildest reports, and the letter\" is supposed to contain wonderful revela- tions. ROME.-A letter from Rome of the 14th, says-. The precautions at present observed both by the French and ecclesiastical authorities, could not be greater if the Romans had risen up with arms in their hands once more to overthrow the chair of St. Peter, and drive its triple-crowned occupant again to the hospitable shores of Gaeta and Portici. GERMANY.-In an official article of the Staats- Anzeiger,' the principal object of the congress of Warsaw is declared to be the re-establishment of the traditional alliance between Prussia and Russia in a conservative interest. The Official Gazette' of Vienna declares the Papal note published by the 1 Independence' of Brussels to be a forgery. Another despatch, dated Frankfort, the 22nd, says :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" It is probable that the Diet will choose five of its members to form a com- mission to administer the affairs of the confederation. This commission would replace the federal commis- sion. The Austrian papers, that is, the papers in the Austrian interest, cease not perseveringly to repeat that the most complete understanding prevails be- tween Austria and Prussia; some of them go so far as to announce that France has unconditionally with- draw-n her protest against the admission of the non- German states of Austria into the Bund. SAXONY.-Tlie King of Saxony is to go to Olmutz to join the Emperors of Russia and Austria there. DENMARK AND THE Ducttits.-The oppression of the inhabitants of Schleswig by the Danish sol- diery is very loudly complained of. The Angles, lately ordered to doff their hats, lowering them to the level of the thigh, resolved to go bareheaded. Immediately an order was published, that every civilian on meeting a military person must halt and make front till the latter passed. A man lately re- turned from the llolsteir. army had still his old mili- tary cup, which he wore at his labour; a hint was given him that such vestige of the insurrection would give umbrage, and he at once laid it aside; but the matter had been reported, and the next day he was hauled up and received twenty-five blows with the stick, producing severe wounds and contusions At Bremen an edict has been published prohibiting all political unions, and empowering the Courts to suppress offensive journals, and forbid the publishers and printers of the same the further exercise of their trade. Letters from Flensburg mention that the delibera- tion of the Notables have taken a very profitless turn. The proposition of the president, Count Bille-Brahe, to adopt the government project as a whole without discussion, has met with no favour from the Dano- Schleswig delegates. Amo ig the llolstein deputies, too, there is a want of unanimity on several points. Tiie I Flyveposton,' reports that the Holstem De- puties have protested against every measure which may tend to a separation between Holstein and Schleswig. A note was received on the 22nd at Copenhagen, from Russia, on the succession question. The I I-reussiselie Zeitung' aftiims that the heir is the thr,n of Denmark pointed out by Russia to the eldest son of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, Sonderburg-Glucksburg, and that this prince will be adopted by the King of Denmark. UNITED STATES.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn Sunday morning, the Bri- tish and North American Royal Mail steam-ship, Niagura, Captain Stone, arrived in the Mersey, having left Boston at noon on the 14th, with ninety- two passengers. The actual news brought by this arrival is scanty and unimportant. The projected Cuban expedition, which was an- nounced as being wholly broken up, has not, it would appear, been entirely abandoned, as we learn that it was not the intention of the leaders to actually orga. nise the expedition in North America, but to sail un- organised to some point beyond the boundaries of the United States, and there make such arrangements as should be deemed expedient. A good deal of excitement was produced in New York on Saturday, by the announcement that the United States Government had chartered a steamer to leave New York with a force of 700 men. It was not known whether this vessel was destined to sup- press rebellion in South Carolina, or to prevent the invasion of Cuba, although rumour spoke confidently of both purposes. According to the best information, it seems that this vessel has been chartered at the suggestion of the United States authorities in New York, to cruise along the coast between this port and Savannah. One of the Chagres steamers, the Cre- scent City, is the vessel engaged for the service. A destructive fire occurred on the 22nd ult, at Santa F\u00c3\u00a9, by which the Exchange, with all its out- houses, &c., was burned to the ground. The loss is estimated at upwards of 20,000 dollars. Colonel Sumner, who was about to take the com- mand of the United States military force in the de- partment of Santa Fe, would take out with him several hundred fresh recruits to fill up the companies now in New Mexico. It is designed to make the army in New Mexico, as far as possible, self-subsistent. The Willis and Forrest case had been postponed until next term; it was said to be virtually aban- doned.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. THE \"CHANGARNIER\" CRISIS. lFrom the Illustrated London .VEITW.] The word crisis\" has been so often misemployed, especially with regard to French affairs, as to have lost much of its significance. There have, in fact, been so many alleged crises which have turned out to be no crises at all, that the world is loth to believe in a new one. Yet, the events of the last week in Paris have, in reality, deserved the name. Whether the crisis be really at an end at the time at which we write, it is im- possible to say; but, pending or completed, the cir- cumstances which preceded and must follow it will necessarily occupy a prominent place hereafter in the page of French history. Since the observations were penned which appeared upon the subject in our last week's publication, the Pre- sident has succeeded in forming a Ministry, and that Ministry have supported him in dismissing General Changarnier from his dangerous command. The Gene- ral has been as coolly superseded as if he had been a corporal, and Paris has rather enjoyed than resented his disgrace. Contrary to the expectations that were in all probability entertained by that large party of politicians forming the majority of the Assembly, who have no con- fidence in one another, or in the Republic whose faithful servants they have sworn to be, the public opinion of the capital, and, as far as it is yet known, of the provinces, has supported Louis Napoleon. Though claiming to be the friends of order, the members of the Parliamentary majority have allowed their hatred of the Revolution, and their jealousy of the President, to betray them into a position the very opposite of that which they desired to hold and they stand before the country convicted in the most palpable manner of a series of gross political blunders. Louis Napoleon, who, on the contrary, has made no secret of the fact, that he has no respect for that article of the Constitution which forbid his own re- election, has acted in this dispute with the most scru- pulous observance both of its letter and its spirit, and has greatly strengthened his previous position. The temperate manner in which he has upheld the dignity of his office has procured him many new friends, without the sacrifice of any old ones and, in the merely personal matter of his ambition to ml\\ke himself Consul, Em- peror, or President' for life, he has gained an advantage over all his opponents, very sensibly diminished the chances of a Legitimate or an Orleanist restoration, and deferred sine die the realization of the daily diminishing hopes of all other aspirants to the Presidential chair.\" But as if it were not enough for the Assembly to be placed in one dilemma, it has rushed into a second. It might have been thought that such cool heads as those of M. Thiers and M. de Remusat might have been of better service to it. Having been shown to be in the wrong, in setting itself up as a power irresponsible to the country that elected it, and unnecessarily, as well as injudiciously, hostile to the President and the Executive Government, it should have had wisdom enough to re- frain from making bad worse. But its first step, after its defeat, has still further tended to diminish the con- fidence of men of business, and of that politically colour- less, but large body of shopkeepers and traders of France, who consider a full till the best of blessings, and who long for a firm and orderly Government, whatever be its principles, as the surest means of attaining it. That class of persons, instead of seeing in the Assembly the upholder of the law, sees in it an unruly party, a violent knot of intriguers, who would rather indulge in political revenge than assure the repose of the country. Acting under the influence of irritated feeling against the Pre- sident and his Ministers for an act which, it must be remembered, was as strictly legal and constitutional as it was imperatively necessary, it has, by a large majority, appointed a select committee to inquire into the state of the nation\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin other words, to deliberate whether it can- not punish the Executive Government for doing what, in the exercise of its discretion, and on its responsibility to the country, it was bound to do. The position held by Changarnier\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe tacitly recognised Monk of two parties, or the Cromwell of another-was totally incom- patible with the authority, if not with the existence, of the ExecutivejGoverment. The result of this ebullition of pique on the part of the Assembly cannot well be otherwise than discreditable or injurious. It will either end in smoke\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin which case the Assembly will be in a worse position than before-one that will verify the truth of the saying of Talleyrand, that un ridicule est pire qu'un crime;\" or it will place itself in more direct and open hostility to the Executive Power-in which case it will expedite a solution, which might well have been postponed until the term prescribed by the Consti- tution for its own re-election. It was at one time pro- posed that General Changarnier should be elected President of the Assembly, in lieu of M. Dupin, in order that he might annoy the President in a new capacity but, as the General cannot speak, and knows nothing of the forms of the Legislature, and as people began to laugh at the mere notion, the idea was abandoned. The next resource thought of for making him a thorn in the side of the Government was to appoint him to the com- mand of a force for the protection of the Assembly but as this bore too much the appearance of a direct chal- lenge and incentive to civil war, the idea fared no better than its predecessor. The third course\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat of appoint- ing a committee to inquire into the state of the nation- was consequently adopted as the safest piece of spite that the Assembly could perpetrate. Thus the Assembly has played a losing, and the Pre- sident a winning game. The one has exhibited mistrust and vindictiveness, together with want of principle, want of faith, want of cohesion-want of everything, in fact, which should have combined to give it a hold upon the respect or affection of the French, or the good opinion of neighbouring nations. The other, on the contrary, has shown strong faith in himself and in his destinies, if in nothing else-together with true courage, and a most; admirable tact and coolness. We know of nothing more reiriark-able in history than the manner in which I he has triumphed over his own antecedents, which were those of hair-brained rashness rather than of common sense, and in which, since he has been placed in the high and perilous seat of power, he has shown his rare pro- ficiency in the difficult art of government. Friends and foes have been alike astonished; and the latter, however much they may have learned to hate, have ceased to scorn him, or to hold his talents in contempt. The his- tory of the first Napoleon is scarcely more marvellous than that of the second. Three short years have trans- formed an exile and an adventurer, almost without money and without friends, and with a character the very reverse of reliable either for prudence or wisdom, into the chief of a great nation\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdplaying a successful part amid difficulties that might task the highest genius and the most consummate ski1l-triumphin over all obstac!es-making the most experien = of his oppo- nents look foolish\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand taking advantage of every false move on the part of others, to make his own position surer. We expressed the same opinions with respect to him at an earlier period of his career and all that has since taken place has but tended to confirm them. Louis Napoleon will, in all probability, attain the object of his ambition but then, and then only, his real troubles and difficulties will begin. It is much easier in such times as these, and amid such a people as the French, to attain dominion, than it is to keep it; and once President for life, or Consul, or Emperor, or by whatever other title he may be called upon to govern, the enmities that are now bitter will become bitterer, and all the partisans of Legitimacy, Orleanism, and Red Republicanism will vie with each other in their hatred. Yet it may be his fate to pilot the French nation over this transitionary period of its history, and to fit it for the enjoyment of that con- stitutionalliberty which it loves so dearly, but which it in no way comprehends. Such a mission would be indeed a great and a useful one but it is one that would be more likely to receive the posthumous rewards of history than the gratitude of the existing generation. The Atlas says that people are already beginning to forget Changarnier much as they forgot Cavaignac. The general has slid down into quiet life, and nobody is likely to go much out of the way to put him up again. The great debate in the French Assembly termi- nated on Saturday evening, by a majority against Ministers of 139. After this defeat, the second in their first week of office, we need not be surprised that the Cabinet placed their collective resignation in the hands of the President. But if Louis Napoleon had the courage ten days ago to insist on so momentous an act of necessary domestic policy as the dismissal of General Changarnier, he will scarcely be satisfied with this proscription of the men who enabled him to carry out his determination. Since the commencement of the crisis his antagonists have certainly done nothing to strengthen their hold on the affection or respect of France. They began by virtually declaring that they would neither take office themselves, nor allow any one who did so to lead a quiet life. They have appropriately concluded by at once raising the Royalist standard against the President and coalescing with tne extreme Republicans in a vote which expresses nothing but the joint determination of all these parties to suspend their quarrels till they have disabled the only set of men who are ready to carry on the government with any chance of popular support. After the speeches of MM. Berryer and Thiers, the main interest of the debate turned on the choice of the amendment on which the Assembly was to divide. The majority selected the single one which is most certain to destroy whatever character for modera- tion and fairness they still enjoyed beyond the walls of the Assembly. It will be remembered that M. Lan- juinais proposed a simple vote of compliment to General Changarnier, whioh no doubt implied a censure on the Cabinet, though it might have been accepted even by them without any logical violation of Parliamentary propriety. It was a vote in which every Royalist might have joined, but whieh nothing could have induced the Left to swallow. M. St. Beuve proposed to substitute a simple vote of want of confidence, omitting all mention of General Changarnier. The Mountain of course caught nt this acknowledgement of their importance. General Cavaignac fairly said that this was the only form of re- solution on which he could support M. Thiers; and to this adhesion M. Changarnier found himself sacrificed. It is difficult to say whether it was more unwise in the majority to abandon the undeniable vantage ground afforded by General Changarnier's high personal claims, or to compromise their Conservative attitude by this concession to a party which we believe to be a great deal more honest, but at the same time a great real more un- popular, than themselves. It is evident that it was too gross for the Conservative leaders who stand the high- est in public esteem. MM. Thiers, Berryer, and Du- faure carried over to the ltepublican party their undis- guiscdly Bourbonist prepossessions, their passion for Parliamentary cabals, and the pique of their private mortification. But on the side of the Cabinet were no fewer than 7 out of the 17 high conservatives who formed the famous Committee on the Hevision of the Electoral Law The Due de Broglie, MM. Leon Faucher, Mont- alembert, Daru, Passy, and Lacrosse, all voted with the government. MM. Mole, Odillon Barrot, Tocqjieville, Lamitte, and de Palloux were all absent from the di- vision. We are compelled, at every step of our criti- cism, to recollect the disadvantage at which foreigners necessarily judge the political history of another people. But whIle we continue to believe that the extra-Parlia- mentary opinion of France is settling firmly in favour of Louis Napoleon, this list induces us to think that those members even within the Assembly who have most position or character to lose, begin to think they have !-one rather too far in their attempt at thwarting the only government at present possible be their un- happy and divided countiy. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Globe. A LUNATIC AKRONIMSSEMRNT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA good deal of alarm was occasioned the other day in one of the ministerial offices, in consequence of a communication received from a mayor in a certain arrondissement of the department of the Aisne. The worthy functionary had received a circular, requesting him to transmit a list of the number of persons in his commune afflicted with mental derange- ment. The term used was alienes. The mayor fancied (why or wherefore no one knows) that the term alienes meant those who were most attentive and punctual in the performance of their religious duties. He pasted himself for three successive Sundays at the church door, and made out a list of the congregation, and which, as he stood up for the honour of his commune, he enlarged as much as possible. The population amounts to about 7,000, and the worthy functionary, in transmitting the list to Paris, stated that he had much pleasure in in- forming Monsieur le Ministre that out of such a popula- tion there was not fewer than 5,000 who were decidedly alienes. The mistake was of course soon discovered. A copy of the Dictionary of the Academy\" has been sent to the mayor. A TALE OF A CAT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Pa,;s Correspondent of the Atlas says in his last communication :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" A comical story is going the round of our salons, and as it has not yet reached the papers, may be considered as private property. It appears that a noble Russian millionnaire, celebrated for his great generosity and admiration of the fair sex, had expressed much devotion to a certain .fair English lady, high in esteem at the lilysee. At the approach of the new year the old gallant was at great pains to ascer- tain what would be most acceptable as a gift to the fair lady, who, in dread of displeasing one who had a greater right to bestow presents, would not-iii spite of pressing \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdconsent to name anything more valuable than an An- gora cat.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAccordingly, the whole city was ransacked to find a valuable animal of the right breed to present to the fair amateur. One was discovered at length posses- sed of the proper dimensions of breast, back, and tail in the lodge of an old portiere of the Rue St. Dominique. The old boyard, however, was resolved to do the thing en prince, and accordingly had a necklace of brilliants of the finest water placed round the sleek neck of Gri- malkin, well knowing that she would be none the less welcome for the adornment. Accordingly, on new-year's morning Prince P- presented himself at the lady's door, carrying the cat beneath his arm, enchanted with his own idea, and delighted beforehand with the effect his generosity would produce. No sooner was the cat placed upon the floor, however, than, scared by the noise made by a certain exalted personage fond of practical jokes, it rushed across the room, flew out of the window which was opeh, darted like mad down the garden and, in spite of all research, of all offers of reward, has never been seen or heard of since Judge of the indignation of the lady-of the consternation of the I exalted per- sonage'\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdfor now that the necklace is lost the Prince declares it to be worth four hundred thousand francs, and the lady insists upon its being replaced by the ex- alted personage who was the cause of the disaster.\" ROME. The Papal Court awaits with some anxiety the opening of Parliament, as it apprehends a serious debate on the Papal aggression. I am not aware that any measures have been adopted by the Papal Government to soften down the anger of the British Government as expressed by Lord John Russell in his letter, or to give instruc- tions to Cardinal Wiseman. Here we have the flower of English ultra-Catholics and converts, amongst them Lord and Lady Fielding. They meet with the most affectionate\" attention from the high Catholic Roman clergy, but are looked upon with utter contempt by the Roman people, thousands of whom would become Pro- testants if his Eminence the Vicar-General and the Head Inquisitor would allow them; but prisons and handcuffs are great dampers to any particular religious tendencies. No deviation from strict Roman Catholic principles, dogmas, or discipline, are tolerated in Rome. The English Protestant Chapel, as Lord Winchelsea accurately described, is really and truly an old granary fitted up by the contributions of Protestants, and is over a pig market and I actually saw more than a thousand pigs driven in on Christmas-day. The French garrison in the city is reduced to 5000 men, but there are a few more in the environs. The officers and men continue to conduct themselves with great propriety, but there is no friendly intercourse with the inhabitants; frequent col- lisions take place in the wine shops between the Roman and French soldiers, and of the latter no less than nine have been killed or wounded within these last ten days. The secret press is still at work, and, notwithstanding a reward of 2000 dollars has been offered to any person who will disclose the name of the printer, pamphlets by Mazzini and his party, daily appear. As far as I can learn the plan of this party is well organised that they regularly receive letters ana instructions and I hear that Mazzini can command men, arms, and money, but that no active measures will be taken, until some dis- turbances in Europe call off the attention of Austria and France. The Roman States are preparing for a san- guinary reaction against the Retrogradists; that, I believe, is undoubted.- Correspoitde?zt of the Morning Chronicle. AUSTRIA AND AMERICA. A diplomatic imbroglio exists between the Government of the United States and that of Austria. Austria has offered as an ultimatum, the alternative of the Govern- ment at Washington refusing to receive Kossuth and other Hungarian refugees, or the Emperor being no longer represented by an accredited agent in the United States. Mr. Webster, Secretary of State, replied, that the country ever had been, and ever would be, regarded as an asylum for political refugees, especially those of a Republican character that, if Kossuth and his com- panions came, they would be received and welcomed; and that, if, under such circumstances, the diplomatic agent should demand his passports, they would be imme- diately given to him. TURKEY. A letter from Constantinople of the 25th ult., in the National Gazette of Berlin, says that the remaining Hungarian refugees who had been at Schumla, arrived in that city on that day, and were about to be shipped off for England. The Government had given each of them 300 piastres. The refugees at Kintaya were shortly to be set at liberty, the Government of Vienna having, after much resistance, yielded to the wishes of the Otto- man Porte. This letter confirms the news of the death of General Bern, at Aleppo, and states that the Govern- ment greatly regretted his loss, as he had commenced the introduction of several useful reforms in the Turkish army. SCHLESWIG HOLSTEIN. I The states of Schleswig Holstein have laid down their arms, reduced their army, and agreed to the dissolution of their Chamber at Jie bidding of Austria and Prussia. A complete, though somewhat qualified, submission to Denmark will be the result. One of the old Schleswig deputies exclaimed as he left the Chamber, Finis Polonioe. If the existence of Schleswig consisted in the mere title of its ruler, no one can regret its finis.\" The kingdom of Schleswig is quite as likely to be as glo- rious as the Duchy. It is said that the monarchs of Austria, Prussia, and Russia intend to meet at Dresden. AMERICA. I LIVERPOOL, SUNDAY, JAN. 19.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBy the United States mail steamer Baltic, Captain Comstock, which arrived in the river shortly before 10 o'clock this morning, we have advices from New York to the 8th instant. The Baltic was detained off the bar for about four hours. The steam-ship Niagara arrived at Boston on the 5th inst. The City of Glasgow screw-steamer arrived at Philadelphia on the 2nd inst. The Crescent City had arrived at New York with dates from California to the 1st of December, Chagres to the 27th, and Kingston (Jamaica) to the 31st ult. She had on freight 1.500,000 dollars in gol(1 dust, and a large amount in the hands of passengers. A specie train was attacked seven miles out of Panama by a party of 16 men, well armed, who succeeded in taking 100,000 dollars, which was, how- ever, nearly all recovered. The steam-ship Oregon arrived at Panama on the 13th of November with 2,000,000 dollars in gold-dust on freight, and 1,000,000 dollars in the hands of passengers. The dry season was setting in at Chagres, and the place becoming more healthy. From the mines we learn that many persons had purchased winter supplies with the intention of passing that season at the dry diggings in the moun- tains. The disappearance of cholera at Sacramento city had caused a revival of business. The rainy sea- son commenced on the 19th of November. Many new veins of ore had been discovered. Agriculture was in a flourishing condition. A new branch of commercial activity had been commenced at San Francisco-that of fitting out whaling ships. A regular line of sailing packets had been established between San Francisco and Panama, touching at Realejo. The miners in the frontier region of El Dorado and Colveras counties laboured under much apprehension of hostile Indians, some murders having taken place. The arrivals had been heavy, and immense quantities of goods thrown on the mart. The Courier and Enquirer announces that official intelligence has been received at Washington, stating that the British Government had directed its agents to suspend the collection of duties at San Juan or Gray town in Nicaragua. Advices to the 31st ult. from Kingston, Jamica, have come to hand. The Great Western arrived on the 28th on the north side of the island. The cholera continued to rage with violence at Mon- tego Bay and Falmouth, but in Kingston, Port Royal, and Spanish Town it had disappeared. The Itoyal mail steam-ship Merlin had arrived at New York with advices from St. Thomas's to the 29th, and Bermuda to the 26th ult., but they contain no intelli- gence. The steam-ship Philadelphia arrived at New Orleans on the 1st inst., with 240 men who had been employed to work on the Panama railroad. The report of the declaration of war between St. Salvador and Honduras is confirmed. Mr. Chatfield has intimated that the British Government would interfere.

Madame Hydatid, the mother and her eldest son, were mor tally wounded the wife of the latter is severely injured, as also is I. Hedaut, the younger, recently retired from the service, and married on the llth of February last; his wife, who was also in the coaoh, received no damage. On the morrow of his crime, the 3rd of March, at six o'clock in the morning, the murderer executed justice on himself by blowing his brains out, near Lussac les Eglises* whither he had proceeded after the perpetration of his crime. Paulait, who is about thirty-four years of age, was of a taciturn disposition, He was generally con- sidered a* a well-conducted man. His fortune con- I- sisted of 40,000 francs in landed property, anu ut had received some education at the college of Mag- nac Laval, lie was married, but had successively lost all his children, to the number of five or six, and this had given him a desire to quit his native place. With this intention, he sold all his property to MM. Iledaud and Chaumoneix for a sum of 33,000 j francs. He soon repented of the bargain, and the sale was cancelled at the cost of 2,000 francs, which were to have been paid to M. Iledaud at a certain fixed period. Patila;t soon after refused to pay, and an action was commenced, which increased Paulait's I liabilities to 5,000 francs. The result of this was an excessive degree of exasperation on the part of the debtor, which for some time he carefully dis- guised. On the 1st of March Paulait met with M. Kedaud at the fair of Bellac, and asked him for 50f. as a loan, which he promised should be returned the next day at St. Sornin. On the 2nd of March, at eleven o'clock in the morning, Pauliit was at the inn of the Green Bull, on the Toad to Magrac, when he perceived in a char- d batic certain persons belonging to the Kedaud family, who were going to the college in that town to visit the young Iledaud at school there. Paulait asked the innkeeper for writing materials, and when he had finished a letter, asked to hob-and-knob with him for the last time, no atten- tion being paid to the expression at the time. lie then went home, cast some bullets and slugs, and ensconced himself at a distance of two kilometers from the cross-road leading to Dompierre. Hidden behind a holly-bush, he laid at his feet two double- barrelled guns and two pistols. At half-past four o'clock he heard a coach coming up the hill at a walking pace, and having assured himself that it contained the Kedaud family, when it had arrived within ten paces of him, he rushed out into the road. The two first shots struck Madame Iledaud in the abdomen. She fell; the horse stopped, and two more shots were fired, taking effect on the shoulder and arm of M. Hedaud, the elder. He had strength, however, to jump down and drag himself to a dis- tance of more than a kilometer; his wife alighted from the cart, threw her arms round the assassin, and entreated him to spare her life, and she would forgive him his debt. The wretch threw her off, crying, 44It is your life I want, Madam!\" and a pistol was directed at her head. She covered it with her arm, and as she was attempting to escape nnnther ball struck her in the loins. M. Itedaud, the younger, had been wounded in the thigh at the same time with his in( tiier-Iiis wife alone cscaped uninjured from this fearful slaughter. The assassin fled in the direction of Lussac, and arrived at the village of IAbaudcrie, at the house of one of his friends. llis disordered features were fearful to look upon. He a^ked for a bed, and one was made up for him in an adjoining bam, there being no room for him in the house. The next day, at five o'clock in the morning, the explosion of a firearm was heard, and on running to the place Paulait was found behind the barn with his head shattered by a pistol shot. The letter written at the inn was lying at his feet. TUN ORXA:O\u00c5\ufffdTAL SCULPTURE ON ST.

The fol- lowing is a brief description of the desigll Britannia, her spear in her right hand, offer ng the olive branch with her left, is seated oil her Maud rock, the lion at her side, and the Mersey or the ocean at her feet. By her side is Mercury, bringing to her the four quarters of the globe; Asia first, with the cornucopia at her feet, America, behind Europe, with her sword of power in her right hand, raising Africa with her left; and, lastly, Africa, in posture of gratitude and humility, with her sons in her arms, the breaking of whose chains is the work of Britannia. Beyond is Bacchus, the pallther and the wine-vase. The other foreign products are repre- sented by two tigurcs drawing to land their several cargoes. On the right of Britannia are the English arts and products advancing to meet the foreign Apollo. Science holds the torch and guides the car, and Agricul- ture is at his side. Behind arc the plough, the spindle, and the beehive, the peasant and his child forming a group to represent the domesticity of England.

They have none of the moderation, the spirit of fairness, the con- scientious rectitude of their English comperes. They are blinded, or at least affect to be, with political hatred.

SPAIN.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOur accounts from Madrid are of the 15th instant. The Queen's state of health continued satisfac- tory. The Carlist journal Catolico had been ordered to suspend its publication. In announcing the demise of the Prince of the Asturias it had declared it a \"provi- dential event.\" The journal Patria had been seized for an article containing the most unbecoming and malevo- lent insinuations against the highest petsonages of the State. The scandal was such that the King thought pro- per to address a letter to the editor, by the Marquess of Alcanices, his First Major-domo, who signed it, refuting those odious calumnies with which his name had been mixed up. General Pavii, director of the Patria, had been ordered to the Canary Islands, and judiciary pro- ceedings were to be taken against the editor. The Gazette publishes the letter. It was as follows \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Some journals, regardless of the TN<YT sacred consideia- tions, have long used the name of the King, confounding it with the contention of parties and using it as the arm of an unnatural opposition. To that effect they have invented the most absurd fables, and carried licentiousness so far as to render indispensable the present manifest ition which I have the honour of addressing to you. It limits itself to contradict all the facts to which I alluded and to curb the abuse which in that respect, is made of the liberty of the press, without heeding tl c interests of their Majesties and those of the country, paiticularly at a moment when bitter grief affl'cts the heart of the King and all loyal Spaniards. I request you to publish this manifestation, and remain,\" &c. Although a portion of the public ascribed the death of the Prince of Asturias to Dr. Sanchez, the Queen conti- nues to place the greatest confidence in him, and would see no other physician. An immense crowd visited the body of the Prince, which was exposed in the Royal Chapel. On the 15th his remains were to be removed to the Escurial. Two of the Ministers were always in attendance at the palace. DENMARK.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWar between Denmark and the Duchies has broken out afresh instantly upon the announcement of the peace between Denmark and Germany, and at the very moment when the principles which ought to terminate this unnatural contest had received the sanction ot the great Powers in the London conference, the actual dispute is brought on the frontiers ol Denmark to the arbitration ot the sword, The armistice of last year suspended hostilities by placing the civil administration of the disputed province under a mixed commission, and by calling in the aid of neutrat troops, to prevent a lurther collision between the King's troops and the insurgents. But that armistice hav- ing ceased upon the conclusion of peace with Prussia, Denmark Las only bought off the intimidation of her German neighbours by exposing herself to more perils at borne, and she rindll herself in sorne respects worse off than if the armistice had never been concluded. Twelve months ago, after tbe battle of Fredericia, which so glo- riously terminated the last campaign, the Danish army coultl unquestionably have completed the rout and annihi- lation of the insurgent forces, which had already been driven back, and couid hardly muster at that time 6,000 fighting men. At that conjuncture the Danish Govern- ment was arrested in the lull tide of success, not less by the remonstrances and advice of England and Russia than by the menacing attitude of Germany and Den- mark submitted to an armistice in full confidence that she would he euabled to obtain, without any further effu- sion of blood, those rights which she could at that moment have enforced with the sword. As this coun- try powerfully contributed to impose an armistice on the contending parties, we were morally bound to take care that its consequences were not such as to in- crease the difficulties and dangers of the King of Denmark. But if that was Lord Palraerston's hope and expectation he was lamentably deceived. The mixed com- mission for the government of Schleswig proved of little use or authority the Prussian officers eluded the obliga- tion ot giving to that Commission the promised military support, and the Prussian Ministers postponed with ex- treme bad faith the fulfilment of the preliminaries and the close of the negotiation. Denmark was condemned to maintain at a vast expense an army and a fleet constantly ready to take the field; but above all, this armistice en- abled tire Schleswig-Holstein party entirely to refit and augment their army; instead of 6,000 fugitives the Stadt- ho|derate now disposes of 33,000 combatants, and in spite of the peace concluded with Germany, German officers of every grade are at this moment leading these troops into action. This state of things is on the face of it grossly unjust to the weaker party, and it has led, as might be expected, to the actual renewal of the war on the first opportunity.

Our accounts from New York by the Niagara extend, by letter, to the 9th inst., and by the electric telegraph, viA Halifax, to the lIth inst., and announce the important fact that President Taylor's political career had been, suddenly and for ever, closed by the stroke of death. The President had been aUacked; shortly after the departure of our last accounts by the Pacific, with a fit of cholera, and, although prompt medical assistance was obtained, the gallant old soldier gradually sank, and at leugth died. Vice-Pie-i- dent Philliuiore succeeds to the vacant presidency, as did President Tayioron the death of General Harrison. A new Cabinet must now also he formed and one point of interest will be the result of the new s'ate of affairs on the slavery question. From Washington our accounts are in other respects almost wholly uninteresting. Much anxiety existed, however, in relation to the disputed question 01 territory between New Mexico and Texas. Troops were being marched to Ibe spot by Texas, and New Mexico had organised a constitution. The documeut had arrived at the capital, and the States' senators were shortly expected. President Taylor's death may also exercise an important negative influence upon the course of events in this quarter. The British Government had made a communication to the United States Government in reference to the wreck ol the steamer Missouri, which was sunk while burning in the harbour of Gibraltar. The wreck endangered nasiga- tion. The subject was before the Committee on Naval Affairs in the Senate. The expense of removing this wreck is estimated at from 80,000 dollars to 90,000 dollars. NEW YORK, JULY 11. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIn the interval elapsed ,.ince the death of President Taylor the proceedings of Con- gress have been of a most impressive character, having exclusive reference to the afflicting event which has plunged the nation into mourniug. Appropriate remarks have been made in both houses. The luoeral is appointed lor Saturday at noon. Mr. Pltillimor by choice of the American people Vice-President, and by the death of the late chief-magistrate now President, was yesterday sworn into office. The Cabinet, as is usual, have tendered thetr resignation?. Various names are mentioned as likely to be called to office, but of course all is idle speculation. It generally is conceded that few, if any, of the late Pre- sident's Cabinet will hold office under tile altered state of affairs. Mr. Webster is confidently named for a state secretaryship.

At Clear Lake a large body of Indians had been killed by a detachment of the United States troops from the garrisous of Sonora and Benicia. MUCH difficulty had arisen from the collection of the mining-tax on foreigners of \u00c2\u00a34 per month. The tax was protected against as exorbitant and unjust, and the citizens generally sympathised with the discontent of the foreigners. Some viohnt demonstration had taken place at Sonora.

About lour in the morning the tire broke out in an unoccupied house on Porfsmoulh-square-oddly enough the same spot in which the last fire in December originated. The combustible nature of the buildings all round the square fed the llames so readily that in a few minut.'s a large space of ground, thickly covered wIth houses, became the scene of a general confl-igration. After the fire was LUin- iiijr for about three-quarters of an hour, and after it had laid bare 8ume 10llr or five acrcs, the mayor pave dir\u00c2\u00a1>ctiona to cut away the hou?es on the t'ast side of Dupont-street. The execution of the mayor's order arrested the progress of the fire in a westerly direction. The fire was prevented from extending into the southern part of the c;ty further than the north side of Clay-street, which was entirely con- sumed. Many of the houses on the south side of this street caught lire, but were saved from destrucriun chiefly hy the exertions of the crews of some of the French vessels in the harbour. The moment was critical, and the checking uf the fire here wa. most impottant, fur its extension beyond this line would have carried. it, beyond all contiol, into the sou- thern portion of the ten to its inevitalile destruction. The escape of this quarter was marvellous. The banking- hou-e of Messrs. Rothschild, which is in Clay-street, escaped destruction as if by a miracle. It was remarked that it shared on this occllsion the usual luck of its fortunate owners. The treasure is preserved in a bricked vault, so that the loss of the house whieh covers it would have been but a baga- telle. The supply of water, was miserably deficient. In short, water, engines, buckets, an ettectve com- bination of men, everything was wanting to extinguish speedily a large fire like this. An area. of eight acres was laid waste. Out of all the houses on this large space, only three buildings were saved, an,1 those (hree were injured. Tbe los* i. estimated at 4,000,000 dollars. I think it likely the houses and their contents cost 4,000,000, although they could be replaced now, owing- to the reduced price of build. ing materials, at less than 3,000,000. Three lives were lost. The tire was iho wotk of an incendiary, aod it is chaiged upon an emigrant from Sydney.

About the year 1527, Patrick Hamilton, a young man of a noble family, having been created Abbot of Feme, was t-ent abroad for his education but had fallen into company with some reformers, and he returned into his own country, very ill disposed towards that church, of which his birth and his merit cntitled him to attain the highest dignitie9. The fervour of you h, au\u00c3\u00b9 hiszeal for 1I0VC:ty, made it impossible lor him to conceal his sentiments; and Campbel, prior of the Dominicans, who, under colour or friendship anJ a sympathy in opininn, hall insinuatcd hims<:>1f illto his cooti- dcnce, 3ccuscd him before Be:1ton, Archbishop of St. AII- drew's. Hamiltoll was invited to St. An\u00c3\u00b9rew's in order to maintain, with ,orne of the clergy, a di-pute concerning the controverted points; and after much reasoning with regard to justification, free-will, original sin. alld other tOpiC; of that nature, the conference ended with their condemning IJamilton to be burned for his errors. The young mjin, who had been deaf to the insinuations of ambition, wa* le-s likely to be i-haken u itli the fears of deal.1 while he pro- posed to himself both the glory of beariug testimony to the truth, and the immediate reward attending his martyrdom. The people, who compassionated hi- joutli, his virtue, and his noble Lirth, were much moved at the constancy of his end; and \u00c2\u00a1;II incident which soon followed still more con- firmed them iu their fa\\ourable sentiments towards him. He had cited Campbel, who still insulted him l1t the stake, to answer bdore the judgment seat of Chritt, and aa tlnt per- secutor, either a2toois!Je-l witl1 these event*, or overcome with remorse, or, perhaps, seized casually with a distemper, soon after Ins: his senses, and fdl inb a fever, of wl1ich Ire died; the people regarded Hamilton as a prophet as well as 8 martyr. Among the disciples converted by Hamilton, was one Friar Forrest, who became a zealous preacher. tiiid who, though he did not openly discover his sentiments, was | suspected to lean towards the new opinions. His diocesan, the Bishop of Dunkcld, enjoined him when he met with a good epistle or good gospel, which favoured the liber- timotioiy church, t) preach on it, and let the rect alone. Forrest replieii, that he had read both Old and New i Testament, and had not found nil ill epistle or ill gospel ill any part of them.

A blow with a stick will disable them, when they are readily dispatched. The young men of the expedition were lond of shooting them with their pistols, but so much ammunition was wasted in this sp. rt, if it may L>e so called, that it became necessary to issue an order forbidding it. c had some experience of the effect of the bite of th.s snake. As we were approach- ing the COllcja river, one of our horsemen discovered a large rattlesnake directly in our trail. He gave him a shut from his six-shooter, which took effect, neai !y cutting his body in two. He then attempted to ride over him, when the fsnake raised his head and struck the horse iu the hind leg, about a foot above the hoof. Several saw the effort of the snake, and we stopped to see whether any injury had been done. We at once discovered the marks where the fangs entered, from which the blood was oozing. V* ithin u.e mmutes the horse, which wa- a very fine one, bepan to limp.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdPARIS, Friday.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The proceedings of tin- ci'tninit'ee of permanence yesterday have oozed out. A member proposed that the commiitee should request the minister of foreign aflfnir\u00c2\u00bb 10 remonstrate with the English tovei nrnent on the subject of the refugees in London, \u00c2\u00bbho. he sai I, were treated with too much indulgence, and al- lowed to conspire against 811 established government'. Anothei member\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdGeneral Changarnier-it is bel'eved, fitatedthat tlhY, the committee, were not a deliberatee body, au\" it was no part of their duty to interfere in general politics. Without approving the English po'icy in tins respect, he would remark, that it was of verv long standing. It dated as far back as Queen Elizabeth, and the laws of England did not permit a ministerto interfere wi\u00c2\u00bbh refugees so tongas they did nothing to menace the public peace of the country winch gave them an asylum. He was decidedly of opinion that the committee ought not to interfere in so delicUe a matter. The proposal was rejected. It is never- theless rumoured this morning that M. Barouche has ad- dressed a diplomatic note to the English government on the subject. The number of arrests of persons accused of being implicated in the plot is now 178. It is said that a per- sonage of some importance has been arrested at Strasbourg. AUSTRI A.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Vienna correspondent of the Times' in a letter dated the 31st August, describes the manner in which the final suppression of the Austrian Constitu. tion has been received by the Viennese If a newly- appointed correspondent had to give an account of the effect produced by the ordinances of the 20th, you would infallibly be informed that they had been received with striking indifference. The state of siege, combined with the preventive measures of the police authorities, renders all freedom of discussion on the part of the press, impos- sible and the fear of the consequences of unguarded language in places of public rp80rt has sealed the lips of the people. The sentiments of the citisens are exchanged but in whispers, and even th.^se cease on the approach of an unknown person. I learn from good authority, that the sullen attitude assumed by the people inspires those in office with serious misgivings, which are increased by the total absence of positive information as to their real opinione. The secret agents of the police are completely at fault, as a tacit agreement seems to have been made that home politics are not even alluded to when strangers are present. Of course there are persons who, either less prudent or more fearless than their neighbours, give vent to their feelings; and the consequence is that a feiv ar. rests take place. As is but natural, the powerful party which offered such an obs!inate passive resistance to the subversive ideas which were introduced during the revo- lution is that most incensed. The Democrats always scoffed at the idea of the constitution becoming a reality; but the Moderates, although against their belter judg- ment, held out to the last. Since the 26th, I have had opportunities of speaking confidentially to great numbers of people of very different classes of society, but I hne found only two who had the couratre to approve the measures; and even Government emplojes alld military men, who are not of the highest rank, strongly disap- prove the cynical way in which the thing was done. The Italians, Hungarians, and other malcontents,, are in high spirits; not, as the partisans of the Government assert is the case, because they were averse to the constitution itself, but bt-cause they feel convinced that the great bulk of the nation has been driven into their camp.\" The same correspondent writing on the 3rd inst., says \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" The ordinance of the 20:h have produced little or no impression on that most sensitive of political ba- rometers, the Exchange\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdsuch was the boast of the reactionary party until 'yesterday morning, when all the manipulations of the government brokers could not pre- vent a serious rise in the exchanges and precious metals. Although those in office affect to \"pooh-pooh\" the state of public feeling, they acknowledge that no time should be lost in giving something instead of that which has been taken, and I learn that when Prince Schwartzenberg returns from Ischl the matter will be taken into imme- diate consideration. It is said that something moie will be granted than is generally expected, but the nation has lost all confidence in the promises of its rulers. The LlIJyd asserts that it is only some few persons of weak intellect who fancy that the aim of Austria is absolutism;\" but that organ of the press generally so popular, has little or no influence in this question. The language of the ministerial organs of the press becomes daily more hostile to England, and even the Oest Correspondenz now and then emulates the Reicks Zeitiing iu violence if not in abuse. In a very remarkable article on the present state of Switzerland it says, Of there is a secret revolu- tionary conclave in Geneva, the aim of which is to over. throw the government at Berne, and energetically to further the general European revolution.\" Then follow certain not very flattering allusions to Sir Robert Peel's behaviour when Minister in Switzerland, and hints that his presence there now bodes no good. The Ministerial organ concludes by reminding all the Conservative Powers how necessary it is to be on their guard. The same warn- ing may also be given to other powers, for the idea is very prevalent in well-informed circles here, that should the political horizon become threatening in France, the allies will undertake a crusade towards the west in the spring. Many persons affirm that the President is pur- suing the same line of conduct as Louis Phillippe after the revolution of 1830, and that he is willing to purchase the good offices of the great Northern Powers at the same price. It is even considered very doubtful whether in the matter of the prolongation of Kossuth's confine- ment he is not going hand-in-hand with Russia and Austria. In a stcond article the Oest Correspondenz triumphs on account of the misunderstandings now ex- isting between the Protestants and Catholics in England, England can do much, for it is mighty but it dare not lay- its hand on that castle of the Lord, the Catholic Church its fleets would be of no avail, and the will of its states- men powerless against that eternal rock.\" Things are still going on very badly in Italy. In and around Ber- gamo nocturnal visits are paid by the police to the houses uf the most respectable inhabitants, and their papers either sealed up or seized. In Venice a priest named Dellocca has been sentenced to five years' imprisonment for circulating some uf Mazzini's proclamations. Many arrests have also taken place in Gallicia. The King and Queen of Prussia nrrived at Ischl on the 31st of August. The Emperor, who by the bye, was received in silence by the inhabitants of that town, drove to meet his illus- trious visitors, and a very friendly meeting is said to have taken place between the Monarchs. The King wore tbe uniform of an Austrian, and the Emperor of a Prussian colouel. The King and Queen leave Ischl to day, and Francis Joseph is expected here on the 5th. He will in- spect the camp in the Marchfeld, near this city, on the 9th, and leave on the' 14th for Verona by way of Trieste and \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd -L-- -u Lombard}-. TURKEY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd According to the correspondence of the Semaphore the question relative to the Hungarian refugees then staying at Kiuiahia was at length settled. The Sultan had resolved to put all end to an unjust confine- ment, calculated only to compromise the character uf his Government. The American steam frigate Mississippi, placed by the President of the United States at the dis- posal of Kossuth, was to repair from Smyrna to the Dardanelles on the 1st. instant, to await their arrival. On the same day the refugees would quit Kiutahia, and embark at Jemelk in a Turkish steamer for the Darda- nelles. Kossuth was to be accompanied by M. Lemmi, a Tuscan, his private secrlttary; by Generals Pevczel and Wisosky, and Count Batthiany, with their families, and 30 other superior officers. The frigate will convey those personages to America, stopping a few days in England. AMERICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBy the arrival of the Royal mail steam-ship Africa, Captain Ryrie, we have received advices from New York to the 27th ult. The Africa sailed from New York at noon on the 27th ult., and experienced fine weather until the 3lst, since which time she has had strong head winds, made Tory Island at 1.45 this morning, and arrived in the Mersey at II o clock, after a fine run of 10 days, 6 hours, and 15 minutes, mean time. The Africa passed a 1 trfre steamer, supposed to be the Asia, at 3.30 a.m., on the 28th ult.-Arrangemenb were being made by Mr. Vanderbilt.of New York, to establish a line of steam communication from San Francisco, by the way of Nicaragua, to Liverpool. It was contemplated to run the steam-ship Northern Light (now building) between Liverpool and New York, connect- ing that port with the steam-ships Prometheus and Daniel Webster, the two latter making alternate trips to San Juan. This line was expected to command the passengers from Europe for San Francisco, as well as a portion of those for other parts of the Union, and efforts were making to secure for it the conveyunce of the gold dust for English houses, hi. therto monopolized by the West India steamers. In order to render the line able to meet the demand for the expected in- creased traffic, a contract had been entered into for a new steamer to run on Lake Nicaragua. LATEST FROM AMERICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLIVERPOOL, WEDNESDAY, Sept. 10.-By the United States' mail steam-ship Baltic, Captain Comstock, we have received advices from New York to the 30th ult. She brings \u00c2\u00a3 126,000 in specie on freight, and about 40 passengers.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThere is a complete dearth of intelligence by this arrival. In the absence of further advice from Cuba the papers continue to republish the old news.-\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe excitement at New Orleans relative to Cuban affairs was far from subsiding. By telegraph from New Orleans we learn that the letter book of the Spanish consul had been seized by the rioters, and that he had resigned his post as consul, and left the Spanish residents to the protection of the Knglish and French consuls. It is stated that I force of 1,000 were collected, awaiting the means of conveyance to Cubn. Meetings were on the increase all over the country, and at Bal- timore an effigy of the American consul at Havannah had, been paraded and burnt.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdUp to the 29th the United States' Government had received no further advices from Cuba.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBy the steam ship Ohio, arrived at New York, we have advices from Kingston, Jamaica, to the 17th ult,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe cholera appeared to be abating in all parts of the island.-The Jamaica Standard, of the 14th inst., says: \u00e2\ufffd\u00a0\" Her Majesty's steamer Inflexible, Commander Dyke, now coaling at Port Royal, is to sail very soon for Port-au-Prince, where, report says, a fleet of English, French, and United States' vessels of war is to assemble, to afford protection to the Dominicans against the tyran. nical conduct of Soulduque, the Emperor of Hayti.\" THE AMERICASS IN CUBA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd-(From the American Papers.)\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdNew Orleans, Aogust 20.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Falcon has are rived with still later advice- from Havannah. Private letters received here st\u00c2\u00bbfe that 4,000 of the Government troops have deserted and joiued Lopez aud his forces. The most intense exbtemeot prevailed throughout the island, and there was no busine-sdoing. We learn that Col.

Braut was also from New Orleans, aud had served in the late war with Mexico. NaPoleon Collins has beeu reco\u00c2\u00abni\u00c2\u00abed as the name of a young man of Soutlnvark, Philadelphia. He has been absent for -onie years, and his former acquaintance knew nothing of his whereabouts, until seeing his name among those butchered at Havannah. WEST IN DIES.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBy the steam ship Dee, which arrived at Southampton, on Tuesday, we learn that a violent gale of wind, approaching to a hurricane, began on the night of Sunday, the lGth Aug., at St. Thomas, and continued to i blow till the following night. A schooner was capsizsd and four men drowned, many of the ships in harbour dragged their anchors, all of the wharves under the town were more or less damaged, some of them completely destroyed, and the sea ran so high that the guns on the battery were dismounted. It is feared that the next mail will bring disastrous accounts from the West India islands generally\". The gale set in from the north-east, veering to the south-east-by-east, and no such violent storm has occurred at St. Thomas since 1837. An insurrection has broken out in New Granada, but little doubt is enter- tained that it will be speedily quelled by the Government troops. The revolutionists have taken up aims, finding remonstrance in vain, accusing the Government of rual. administration of the law, protecting assassins, and spoil- ing the country for their own gain. At Jamaica the want of labour is much felt; but the state of public health is very satisfactory, notwithstanding the cholera still re- mains in some parts of the island. There was a rumour that Sir duties Grey was about to retire. The Mar. tinique journals bring startling accounts of a frightful erup;iou.of the long dormant voieanoot the Pelee Moun- tain in that island, which took place during the night ol the 5th ult. The St. Lucia Palladium contains the sub- joined account of the occurrence: \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd It Like the great and ineviorable eriijiii \u00c2\u00bbn of the St. Vineein Soufriere, ni 1813, the pheiiomenou at Martinique is described all havui\" beeu accompanied with a uuise similar to the ap- proach of thuuder still m-arer and nearer, with a vibration thai 04\u00c2\u00a1I\"'cLcd the fei'liugs and hearing.'

PLYMOUTH, TUESDAY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe General Screw Steam Shipping Company's steam ship Hellespont, Captain William Watts, arrived here about midday. Her dates are, Cape of Good Hope, August I Sierra Leone, August 16; and St. Vincent, August 24.-Her accounts of the state of affairs on the frontier are far from satis- factory. Sir Harry Smith appears to have made no move- ment of consequence during the previous month, white the Caffres and Hottentots are spreading themselves through the eastern provinces and penetrating settle- ments previously considered secure from danger. Just previous to the departure of the steamer news reached the Cape of an attack upon some English between Fort Beaufort and Graham's Town, when five were killed by therebei Hottentots. Strong patrols were sent out im. mediately, but with what success is not known. It ap- pears that while Sir Harry Smith has been checking the enemy on the frontier, the Caffres and Hottentots have been invading and pillaging the interior. The Times correspondent at the Cape, under dale August I, sa^s\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd From what I can learn, Maj-Ir Warden has been de- feated in the Sovereignty, the Caffres are within fire miles of Nitenhage, and the war, consequently, in the heart of the colony.\" About the 20th of July, on the return of a patrol under Colonel Mitchet),from Kieskam- ma, they were unsuccessfully attacked by Seyolo. who slated that as he had lost his country and cuttlc he diil not desire peace. The news froUl Kreli is pacific, and he professes to have discovered his error. Sandilli is said to be dejected, and to be contemplating removal beyond the Kye. Pato continues attached to British int/rest?. No further supply of troops had reached the Cnpe subse- quent to the arrival of the Vulcan, but the Government despatches forwarded by the Hellespont, were sent to the frontier b) her Majesty's steamer Hermes, which was pro- vided with sufficient fuel to go on to the Mauritius, where there are spare troops. LATEST INTELLIGENCE. CAPE TOWN, AUG. 1, 11 A.M. Thefrontierrnait arrived early this morning. The dates are from Graham's Town, J ul) V6, and from head- quarters lip to the :;3rd. A patrol under the command of Colonel Mitchell had returned that day without booty. Nearly all the Caffre cattle, as well as those fatten from the colony, having been driveu to a distance a patrol under Colonel Eyre had not yet returned. The news from Kreli is pacific. Two messengers had arrived at King William's Town, with a message from him to the Governor. The substanceis stated to be a desire for peace, a profession of tidettytowardsthe British Go- vernment, and as a proof, a request that the British Resident may be sent back in order to be the medium cf future communication. Sandilli, it is said, contemplates a removal with his people to beyond the Kye. He had sent messengers lo Palo, who had gone to Forl Murray to receive their communication. What the substance was is not known. The next intelligence is very distressing; another at- tack has been made on the frontier mail near Leeuwe Fontein. between Graham's Town and Fort Beaufort, by the Hottentots. The party (among whom were two respectable tradesmen of the latter town, who availed themselves of the return of the post) were fired on six were killed and one wouaded, the man who brought the intelligence alone escaping. On the same day a party of the European levy, in pursuit of some cattle, met with a severe repulse from the enemy, five of the levy being killed. General Somerset had sent outastroug force in pursuit. Prom Port Elizabeth information had been received of the great destruction of property in the Zuuberg and Oliphant's Hoek. It is said that the line of Sunday's River, if not that of the Zwaartkops also, is contested by the enemy. (FROM THE SUPPLEMENT TO THE CAPE TOWN MAIL,\" OF AUGUST 1ST.) Cape Town Mail Office, Friday, Aug. 1, 11 a.m. The post which has just arrived from the frontier brings additional intelligence of a painful and disheartening character. The Caffres and rebel Hottentots were spreading themselves in large parties over the country, from Sunday's River to the Amatolas, slaying, pillaging and burning in all directions. Some atrocious murders of frontier colonists had been committed by the Hotten- tot banditti. III British Caffraria there was comparative peace. The patrols sent out from King William's Town encountered few enemies, and obtained no booty, the cattle of the Caffres having been driveu to a distance. lhe accounts of the irruption of the Caffres into the Zuurberg are confirmed. (FROM THE \"GRAHAM'S TOWN JOURNAL,\" JULY 26.) Information has come in from General Somerset's camp to yesterday. The General had heard of the fatal affiir on the Koonap hill, and had instantly detached 100 men of the 74th Regiment, 30 of the European Levy, and a detachment of the Cape Mouuted Rtties, under Lieut. Green, the whole under the command of Capt. > 74th Regiment, to proceed to the scene of the murder, and to follow the banditti wherever they may pursue their murderouscareer.

MR. GEORGE DAWSON'S LECTURE\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdTho announcement that this eloquent and popular gentleman will noxt week deli- ver a lecture on \"Popular proverbs, their wisdom, or want of it,\" will doubtless afford much pleasure to a largo portion of the community. Our able contemporary, the Swansea Herald, says of Mr. Dawson:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" In describing him as a popular lectu- rer, wo must not, however, bo understood as implying the vague definition usually given to popularity, that ot a fluent or even powerful speaker, apart from literary qualifications on the contrary, thero is probably no living lecturer, if we except Carlyle, who, more than Mr. Dawson, excels in the art of rendering literature familiar to the every-day order ot minds. Henoe it is, that from tho mixed but intelligent andionces of the Manchester Atlionajum to the relined W hit- tington Club, Mr. Dawson has found welcoinc as a speaker, not only of the highest literary attainments, but at the same time, as one using those words which burn, that charm the many. The power of George Dawson may oailily bo inferred from the fact, that in tho report of a committeo ot the House of Commons on Public Libraries, ho is distinctly indicated as one of tho great agents who have silontly but suroly contribu- ted to that taste for German literature, which is becoming so prevalent among the best educated and the most refined classos of this country, a* to make a study ot the language which is its repository, one of tho essential branches of tire soholarly learning of the 'times we live in.

REMISSION OF PENALTY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIn tho case of Jenkins, con- vir-tof} before the borough magistrates last week, of selling a of gin-and-water, and a pipo of tobacco without license, loard of Inland Revenue, on being memorialised by Mr. cart for his client, promptly mitigated the penalty of i 10s. on each information, to the sum nf \u00c2\u00a37 only, <JU i hoped this conviction will serve all a warning to unli- died dealers; for though heavy penalties for such apparently offences as Jenkins was guilty of, may appear harsh, yet the fair trader, who pays dearly for his licenses, ought to have the fullest protection. SAFETY OF THE IDA KISS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAll fears\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand they were many and deoply felt-for the safety of this ship, with a largo number of emigrants for Now York.are fortunately dispelled by the intelligence of her arrival at that port in safety, after passage of sixty-four days from this port. No accident or death among the passengers had occurred; and the non-arri- val of intelligence respecting the safety of the ship, is attri- buted to the remissness of agents at New York, which circum- stance has been strongly commented on. THE BARQUE WILLIAM WILMETT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe near that this fine barque, built by her owner, in this port, has arrived at Leith from Callao. Her oommander, Mr: M. Wells, also of this port, speaks highly of her sailing qualities. THK GALES.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn Tuesday night and Wednesday, we were visited by a furious gale, which occasioned considerable damage to houso-tops, chimneys, &c., in this town, and to trees, nay, and corn ricks, and all property that could be blown about, in the county. Wo understand, that owing to the unremitting carefulness of Captain Parfitt and the Dock authorities, the large number of shipping in tho dock were so securely prepared by men with good weather eyes, as to ride out the tempest scathlesslv. We have not heard of any casualty occurring to the other shipping ot the port. GINGER BEER ROOT\u00c2\u00abERY.-Ou Tuesday evening last, some thirsty soul, fonder of ginger pop than tho gonorahty of people in cold weather, and an espocial patron of that un- rivalled manufacturer of tho article, Mr. Bateson, broke a pane of glass in a window of the Bristol beerhouse, m this town, kept by Mr. Charles Bond, and COIlt\"ve<J \u00c2\u00a3 \"5.jf half-a-score bottles of tho delicious beverage (genuine Bate- son's nectar) without deteotion. SERIOUS OCCURRENCE. On Tuesday week, it was discovered that a fire had broken out, and had attained con- siderable height, in the bedroom of the Rev .Tames Coles, Michaelstone-y-Vedw, but, most fortunately, not too lato to be mastered by the presence of mind and ene gy o e re gentleman, well aided by his domestics.

JAMAICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe cholera has abated very considerably at Kingston, Port Royal, and St. Catheiine indeed, in the last mentioned places it may be said to have disappeared entirely. We regret much to find, however, that it was spreading fear- fully throughout the country parishes, in the agricultural dis- tricts.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe House of Assembly met pursuant to adjournment fin the 19th of November, when a bill was enacted to afford additional pecuniary relief to the different parishes infected with the epidemic Ten thousand pounds were voted for the purpose, and placed in the hands of the central board of com- missioners in Spanish Town.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd In those places in which the disease was raging, as well as in those from which it had de- parted, the greatest destitution and misery existed. Mr. William Smith had made an appeal to the public on behalf of the cholera orphans, suggesting the formation of an orphan asylum. Dr. James Macfayden, a gentleman of high attain- ments, fell a victim to the disease, in Kingston, a lew days before the packet left. His- loss was greatly felt among the inhabitants. BARBAOOES.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe cholera has made its appearance in Bar badoes amongst the troops stationed in that island, but was considered by the medical men to bo sporadic, not unusual in the tropics. The board of health had, however, taken the ne- eessary KtppS to insurc cleanliness, &c., by which means it is hoped that the island may be lightly passed over. The wea- ther is remarkably tine, some relre^hing showers having fallen. ANTIGUA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdTwo severe shocks of earthquake were expe- rienced here on the morning of the 2nd November.

On the ftli she appeared at Baltimore, when the receipts were about \u00c2\u00a3 3,000 sterling. Rumours wore current that the wreck of the screw steamer Helena Slowman had been picked up off the coast. From Mavannah we have accounts of the 2nd just. Affairs were quiet. Count Alcoy bad left lor Cadiz in the war steamer Caledonia. The Spanish frigate Isabel 11. and the sloop Jason arrived from Cadii on the 211th ult. with 1,048 men and ollicers to reinforce the troops on the island. More regiments were soon expected.

Panama and Chagres accounts state that large numbers of passengers had arrived on the Isthmus en route to and from the States to the Pacific coast. Much rain had fallen, and the roads were in a terrible condition. Jamiaca advices of the 1st inst. state that the cholera was then more severe in other parts of the island than at that port. Five thousand deaths had occurred at Kingston. Among medical men deaeased were Drs. Bailey, Murcott, Tabois, Tait, and M. Fadgen.

No further arrangement has been made in regard to the internal debt. A bill for that purpose has bteu under discussion in the Senate, and the Chamber of Deputies appointed as a committee of conference with the creditors in order to agree upon the terms. Nothing has yet been accomplished by this measure, and it is feared that it will prove wholly ineffectual. A Bill has passed both Houses of the Legislature, permitting the introduction of foreign corn (maize) on the payment of a certain duty, into the ports ot Talllpico and Matamoras. An application has been made to the Mexican Congress by Lower California, to be admitted as a State of the Republic, or to be attached as a territory to Aguas Calientes.

From the mines we have little news worthy of note. At San Francisco, on the 20th of October, a horrible steam-boat explosion occurred, by which from 80 to 100 lives were lost. Cholera had also broken out in the city, and was spreading with great rapidity, Fire had destroyed the city hospital on the 31st of October, but all the inmates were saved. Business was doll, and during the prr- ceding fortnight, transactions had been small compared with those of the first half of the month.

A con. stable on duty, who was a witness of the act, covered him with his piece, and i ailed him to forbear, seconding this by rushing at the boat and knocking a hole in her bottom with hiscarbine. He then pointed out to all four the folly of resistance and re quired them to sHf&i.it quietly, which they did.

He will be replaced in the post at London by Count Colonna Walewski, lately appointed ambassador to Madrid, and who was previously French minister at the Court of Naples. The National publishes a protest, signed by M. C. Lesseps, and several other persons, now confined in the prison of Agen, charged with being concerned in the Lyons conspiracy. They complain bitterly of the treatment they have undergone, in being dragged from prison 10 prison, for eight months, while scarcely the shadow of a charge, they affirm, can be brought against them, except that they are republicans. They ask for immediate trial, which, they assert, will fully establish their innocence. M. Dumas, late minister of commerce, has just left Paris, for London. The committee of revision sat on Saturday, and, in the course of the discussion, M. Berryer declared that his main object in desiring a total revision, was to prevent the re elec- tion of Louis Napoleon. SPAIN. The Marquess of Mirafiorcs, the minister for foreign affairs, was recently questioned in the senate, as to the inten- tions of Spain with regard to intervention in the affairs of Por- tugal. In reply, the minister stated that he respected, in the highest degree, the independence of other nations. He added, that the single exception would be that of Queen Isabella's government beholding Queen Donna Maria's throne in danger but that event had not happened, and. at that moment, nu- thing serious need be apprehended. The Duke of Saldanha had hastened to assure the representatives of France, ol Eng- land, and of Spain, that as long as he should be honoured with the confidence of the Queen, there was nothing to be feared for the safety of the throne of Donna Maria. Up to this pe- riod, the representatives of the three powers at Lisbon had limited themselves to giving to Marshal Saldanha and the Por- tuguese government wise and salutary counsels touching the preservation of the throne. If. however\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwhich God forbid\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd the crown of Queen Donna Maria should one day be placed in peril, aud the intervention 01 Spain become necessary, th.t intervention should not take place without a previous under- standing between Spain and the other powers who were par- ties to the treaty of the quadruple alliance. ITALV. The government of Piedmont has ordered Count Bertola de Rimini, an emissary of the Pope and of the Emperor of Aus- tria, to be expelled the country, and to be conveyed to the frontier by the police. An English family, named Aldborough, has been placed under arrest at Leghorn. The Austrians have entered Spoleto. GERMANY. It is positively affirmed in Paris that fresh disturbances have taken place at Hamburgh, and that the Austrians were notable to put it down but by the use of the most energetic means. A letter from Cologne, of the 11th, says:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" Prince and Princess de Metternich arrived here last evening by the Brus- sels Railway, aud immediately set forward for Johaunisberg. The reception given to the Prince at the station was anything but Haltering, and even some hisses were heard.\" A German paper states that a bill is to be almost imme- diately brought forward in the German Diet, for the forma- tion of an army of not less than 125,000 men. oil the hanks of ihe Rhine. The principal object of establishing this body of men in the position just mentioned, is to protect Germany against all eventualities of affairs in France. A letter from Berlin, of the 8th, says\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" The celebrated group in bronze of M, Kiss, representing an Amazon fighting with a lion, has just been purchased by the Prince of Prussia, who intends it as a present to the Queen of England.

By the royal mail steam ship Africa, Captain Ryrie, which arrived shortly after eleven o'clock on Sunday morning, at Liverpool, we have advices from New York to the 4th instant. She brings 680,000 dollars in specie on freight. By the steam-ship North America, arrived at New York, we have California advices to the 1st of May. She had on freight 800,000 dollars in coin and gold-dust. The steam-ships Oregon, Republic, and Union, had arrived at Panama from San Francisco, with a large amount of gold dust, much of which was to go direct to England. The amount of specie exported from San Francisco during the four months ending with April, was estimated at 15,637,542 dollars. The crops promised to be favourable. The population of California was computed at 130,000 people. It was rumoured that a secret expedition was about to leave San Francisco, for the purpose of Americanizing Southern California and Northern Mexico. The mining intelligence is very satisfactory throughout the whole southern regions the mines were reaping a rich harvest. The reported discovery of exceedingly rich beds of gold in Shasta Valley, is confirmed. At Placerville, a company of four persons were taking out daily 1,000 dollars; the place had been previously worked. Extensive veins of gold dust had also been discovered between the middle and north fork of the American River. Besides these discoveries, new veins were being constantly found, and from all quarters the accounts are exceedingly satisfactory as regards the yield. Specimens of quartz, excelling in value all previously dis- covered. had been brought to San Francisco, the produce be- ing lower than 33 per cent. of gold. There had been a large accession of ladies at San Fran- cisco, and their civilizing effect was beginning to be felt. The steam-ship Empire City was at New York, from Chagres, with nearly 2,000.000 dollars on freight. The royal mail steam. ship Bolivia arrived at Panama on the 18th ultimo, from Valparaiso, with 817,000 dolls, in silver bullion. An earthquake, which nearly swallowed up Valparaiso, oc- curred on the 3rd of April: the first shock, which was the se- verest one, and which caused the falling of many buildings, and the destruction of much property, occurred at about six o'clock in the morning, but occasional shocks of greater or less severity were felt for the succeeding ten days, doing more or less damage. Advices from the Sandwich Islands to the 29th of March, mention that the difficulties between the Ilawaian government had been arranged. WEST INDIES. Advices from Guadaloupe report that an earthquake oc- curred there on the 17th ult.; many houses were destroyed and plantations injured throughout the island. We have intelligence from Hayti to the 18th ult. Every- thing was quiet. From Kingston, Jamaica, we have advices to the 27th ult. The House of Assembly was adjourned on the 23rd ult. The weather had been very fine. His Excellency, in his speech, condemned some of the acts of the legislature. INDIA. India is tranquil throughout. The Governor-general was to be at Simlah by tile lO-h or 12th of May. It was expected that he would thence proceed to Kunawar, his former resi- dence in the Ilimalayahs, and it is decided that he visits Cal- cutta next cold weather. The western frontier of the Punjaub is still threatened by the Indus hill tribes, and there seems to be no intermission 01 the robberies and murders committed by those very trouble- some neighbours. They have, in fact, been accustomed for generations to look upon the plains adjoining their hills as their own peculiar hunting-grounds, whence they may periodi- cally obtain by force what nature has denied them in their mountain fastnesses, and it cannot be expected that they should all at once desist from the pursuit of their accustomed and hereditary avocations. Sir William Gomm has purchased a house at Simlah, and it is understood that he intends to make it his iesidence during his term of service in India. There have been storms of rain and hail throughout the north-west provinces, in Bengal and Madras. Near Calcutta, the hailstones were of the size of hen's eggs, and did much da- mage. The rain has, however, everywhere tempered the heats of May very agreeably and at Madras has been most season* able in filling some of the tanks, and relieving the inhabitants from a scaicity of water, which was beginning to be severely felt. The murderer of Lieutenant Johnstone, of the 3rd Madras Cavalry, is still at large, and the officers of the regiment have offered a reward of one thousand rupees for his apprehension. At Bombay, the event of the foitnight has been the disco- very of the perpetrators of the robbery of Bank of Bombay notes, committed at the Oriental Bank, on the 8th of February )at. The principal culprit is a young Parsee of very good family, named Dorabjee Hot-rnasjee, the author of a book of tables (the Oriental Calculator\") universally used in India. The most unlimited confidence had altvays been placed in him, and he was never suspected in the slight- est degree. An attempt on his part to sell the stolen notes to native money brokers, led to his detection. The Parsees have hitherto enjoyed a very high character for honesty, and Dorabjee's delinquency is felt to be a misfortune to their whole caste. Lord Falkland is detained at Bombay by the piessure of' public business. No requisition has yet arrived for troops for the Cape, but two Queen's regiments are holding themselves in readiness for such a summons, at Calcutta and Madras, and steam-frigates for their conveyance are prepared to start ftom Bombay at a moment's notice.\" CHINA. The mail steamer arrived at Hong Kong on the 14th of April, bringing advices from England to the 24th of February. Major-General Jervois,the successor of Major-General Sta- veley, in the command of the troops there, arrived by that op- portunity. His appointment as Lieutenant-Governor of Hong- Kong, has since been officially notified.

{"ocr": "NINTH ANNUAL KEPOE.T OF THE NEWPORT Athenaeum and Mechanics' Institute. IN presenting the ninth annual report of the Newport Athenaeum and Mechanics' Institute, your Committee have the gratification again to congratulate themselves and the members upon the healthy condition of the Institution, and to record that the efforts which have been made during the past year to promote its welfare and progression, by endeavouring diligently to insure efficiency in all its departments, have been signal and decisive in their results. The suecess which has already attended the Institute, the great moral power which its extensive Library has exerted, the obvious and cheering appreciation of its claims and advantages, furnish ample evidence that an alliance between commercial and intellectual pursuits may happily exist, and that the great objects, the promo- tion of social and mental progress, for which the Institution was established, arc well-adapted to the tastes and requirements of the day. The triumph, however, of the Institute is far from complete, for, although the number of its hearty supporters is encouraging the great and varied benefits derivable for so small a pecuniary con- sideration, induce the wonder that the Institute should not in- clude amongst its members a much larger number of the young men, and a very much greater proportion of the operatives and mechanics of this important town, who, from motives of personal interest, if from no higher, should eagerly embracc the opportuni- ties it affords of preparing themselves to maintain a fitting status in society, and of rendering themselves proof against those evils and misfortunes, which ignorance and non-advancement infallibly entail. Your Committee look forward to the coming year as one full of hope and promise, believing that past successes, acting as powerful incentives, will enlist the co-operative efforts of each in- dividual member, to effect the great desiderata of extension and increase, and to give permanency and due value to the principles and objects of the Institution. The consolidation and vitality the Institute has acquired by its participation in the onward movement of the day, could not fail to have inspired your Committee with the hope that the period is not far distant when a building, dedicated to the cause of moral and intellectual progress, will be provided, worthy of our influential and rising town: the necessity for promptitude in consummating this desirable object, is loudly expressed and deeply felt. Your Com- mittee rejoice in this manifestation of sympathy, believing that it must shortly result in clearing the way for laying tho foundation of an Institution, which shall relatively rival in importance the kindred institutions of this great empire. Your Committee invite your especial attention to that part of the report which refers to the Library. It will be seen that large ad- ditions to its shelves have been made, and among the more valuable works may be enumerated Alison's History of Europe, Macau- Icy's History of England, Sidney Smith's Works, Prescott's His- torical Works, Ac., &c. To those who have swelled its numbers by their kind presentations they express their grateful ackowlcdgments, and trust that the growing demand for books will call forth a hearty response to their usual appeal, and that the ensuing year will witness an increased manifestation of liberal effort to adu stability, and to give perma- nent wealth to this important branch of the Institution. To afford ihe members greater facilities for obtaining Books, your Committee recommend the engagement of a paid Librarian, who shall attend the library every evening during the week, except on Tuesday, from half-past seven to nine o'clock, and on Saturday from one to three in the afternoon. This arrangement is not intended to super- sede the appointment of those gentlemen who have hitherto per- formed the duties gratuitously; and it is confidently hoped that the increased convenience thus given, will induco a large accession of lady and country members.

Jones and Jayne, Hono- rary Secretaries, last year \u00c2\u00a3 5 17 11) Receipts for current year 288 2 0 Total receipts 293 19 10 The expenditure has been 202 5 9 Leaving the large balance of t 31 14 1 In favour of the Institution, every liability of which has been met. MEMIiERS. The number of members enrolled for the quarter now ending, is 515, being an increase of 103 over the highest number yet obtained by the Institute. Your Committee regard this fact with great satisfaction, and while they urge upon those gentlemen who have by active canvass effected this successful issue, to renew their efforts, they sincerely hope that those parties who allow their con- nection with the Institute to cease during the sutnmer quarters, will, during the coming year, regularly take up their quarterly tickets, or become annual subscribers.

READING ROOM. Mr. E. V. Jenkins has, in the past year, kindly presented the Institution with a valuable and complete set of Phrenological Casts, published by Deville, constituting a perfect chart for the phrenological student, and an ornament to the shelves of the read ing room. In consequence of the great increase of members, your CUJIlmittec hare decmml it nuccasary to add daily and other papers to the table of the room.

The room continues open from 9 A.M. to 10 P.M., and is gene- rally crowded by attentive readers. LIBRARY. This department which may now be justly considered the basis of the Institution, has accumulated strength during the year, by the expenditure of \u00c2\u00a3 46 IBs. 2d., in the purchase of standard anil other approved works, which, with donations and the bound periodicals, has resulted in the addition of 289 volumes to its shelves. Your Committee will deem it their duty ever to maintain a due regard to the prosperity ot this important branch of the In- stitution. The Library now contains 127G volumes; in the year 1846 it only numbered JI, o volumes. The circulation, during the year, has amounted to bdbJ volumes, or an average of 61 volumes distributed per night. In accordance with the recommendation contained in the last report, a revision of the catalogue has been effected, which is now on sale, price 3d., with supplement just added. The following books have beeu presented durinn- the vo.nr \u00e2\ufffd\u00a0_ By Sir Thomas Illillips: \u00c2\u00b0 yoJs Wales i By Mr. R. G.

On reference to the balance sheet it will be seen the large sum of \u00c2\u00a3 75 15s. 6d. has been paid in fees to lecturers, while the receipts have not been sufficient to meet the expenditure. The lectures, however, have not been inferior in attraction, talent, or number, to any delivered during preceding years, as the unqualified approba- tion which has been accorded to them amply testifies. Your Com- mittee, therefore, hope that their efforts to maintain the efficiency of this department in the ensuing year, will be encouraged by the universal support of the members.

A musical soiree, to commemorate the ninth anniversary', was held at the town hall, on Friday, the 22nd of March, which was respectably and numerously attended. Your Committee were enabled, through the kindness of Colonel Barlow and Officers, to avail themselves of the effective services of the band of the 44th Regiment, which performed during tea a choice selection ot pieces arranged for the occasion, and which added much to the pleasure of the evening. A glee party, composed of Mrs. Tilley, Miss Clowes, and Messrs. Price and Groves, were engaged; their performances gave great satisfaction, and they were ably assisted by the gratuitous services of Mr. R. M. Toogood. Short addresses were delivered during the evening by various gentlemen. The refreshments, &c., were supplied by Mr. James Ewins, jun., whoso catering on the occasion gave yevy general satisfaction. INSURANCE. In consequence of the yearly increasing value of the stock and effects of the Institution, your Committee have deemed it necessary to insure the property to* the amount of \u00c2\u00a3 200 with the General Fire and Life Insurance Company. Your Committee cannot conclude the report without making special reference to the effective services which the retiring secre- taries have rendered to the Institution. They have much pleasure in according to them (not forgetting the anterior claims of their predecessors), this testimony of their esteem, as they cordially believe that the ability and indefatigable energy which have so unquestionably marked their year of office, have oeen promotivo of the success, and largely contributed to secure tho exalted posi- tion which the Institution now enjoys.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. \u00c2\u00ab. THE FRENCH REPUBLIC. The President of the Republic, to whom had been referred the matters in dispute between the United States and Portugal, has just given his award in favour of Portugal. The Paris papers state that mucb excitement existed rela- tive to an interview in England between M. Berryer, M. Bo- noist d'Any, and M. de St. Priest, with the widow of Louis Phillippe, the Duke de Nemours, and the Prince de Joinville, with a view to a fusion of the two branches of the Bourbons. The Ordre affirms that the Queen and the two Princes. whilst professing the most conciliatory sentiments, declared that they would submit to whatever decision France as a free State might come to. The Patrie 6ays\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\"The seizure of a number of uniforms in the packages addressed to the Duke of Brunswick, has been the subject of general conversation, and several journals have gone so far as to state that interpellations would be put to the government on the subject. The following is the version of the affair, the correctness of which we can guarantee \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd It was so far back as 1832, that the Duke of Brunswick had these uniforms, to the number of about 6.000, made at Bordeaux. The Duke at that time hoped to obtain the authorisation to assemble and equip an armed body, in order to recover his duchy. Not having succeeded in these attempts, and the French government having sent him to the frontier for the fact, the Duke ot Brunswick had the uniforms brought to him at Paris, and afterwards sent them to London, where they have ever since been lying. On returning to Paris, the Duke thought he might again have them sent here, in order to get r'd of them, and it is during theii passage that they have been seized by the custom-house officers. If we are well in- formed, the Duke of Brunswick now wishes to get rid of them at the best price he can obtain.\" The number of accused in what is called the Lyons plot s forty-three-of whom thirty-four are in custody. The trial is expected to begin at the latter end of the month it is to take Place at the Court of Assize of the Palace of Justice, before a court-martial. The number of witnesses to be summoned for the prosecution is eighty-two. The accused were on Friday taken before the officers charged to investigate the affair, and all the documents were read to them they were a'so called on. to name the persons they wished to be summoned to give evidence on their behalf. The documents connected with the affair are very numerous, and the trial will occupy several days. The debate on the revision question commenced on Tues- day in the National Assembly. It is expected to last for a week. M. Daguerre, the inventor of the daguerreotype, died sud- denly on Thursday he was sixty three years ot age. A Rheims journal announces that a company, consisting of English and French capitalists, has been formed for procuring the concession of a railway from Douai to Rheims. The French capitalists have already signed the demand to be ad- dressed to the government, and it has been sent to London foi the signatures of the English. It is proposed to terminate the n \u00c2\u00b0l? 'me 'n ^ve y*ars- -^ie President of the Republic and all the ministers are stated to be favourable to the project. PORTUGAL. In consequence of the intrigues of the courtiers who support the Cabrals, the Marquess of Louie, and Senhore Loure and Pertana have been compelled to resign their portfolios. The Duke of Saldanha had previously explained to them the difli culties by 'which he was hampered in consequence of the Cabralite intriguers.

A letter from Ajaceio, in Corsica, inform us that the Van- ban steam-frigate arrived there on the 3rd inst. with the mem- bers of the municipal commission, who had been to Rome, to receive the remains of the mother of the Emperor Napoleon, and those of Cardinal Fesch, his uncle. These remains were landed on the following day, and conveyed, with great pomp, to the cathedral, where a funeral service was performed by the Bishop of Ajaccio. ITALY. A Milan paper of the 7th publishes the regulatious for the Free Port of Venice. The limits are declared to extend from the port of Malamocco to the Garzina, near Sant 'Erasmo the intermediate line is to be marked by coloured poles. Within these limits trade is to be perfectly free, and no cus toms' duties are to be levied upon any description of mer- chandise. There are to be custom-houses at Treporti. Maz- Jorbo. Compalto, Fusina, and San Pietro in Volta, forming a second line around the first. The intermediate space is to be the territory of the customs. Vessels of all nations are free to enter the ports of Lido and Malamocco without paying customs' duties. Certain canals are pointed out, by which Merchandise may be shipped to the mainland. Fishermen's boats may go to any spot of the mainland, if licensed, and not Jaden wilh goods. Salt, tobacco, nitre, and gunpowder, being Monopolies of the state, are not allowed to be unshipped within the precincts of the free port, except in the custom house. GERMANY. France and England have protested at Frankfort against the entrance of Austria with all her provinces into the Germanic ,et, and require that Prussia shall withdraw her non-Ger- man, provinces. Prussia, though wishing to withdraw her provinces, has declared that that matter, as also the entrance Austrian provinces, ar#only of domestic concern, and that ,\u00c2\u00b0feign powers cannot be allowed to interfere. I he Frankfort '\u00c2\u00b0.u^\"a'8 state that Austria will neither oppose nor support the withdrawal of the non-German provinces of Prussia, but will Propose to the Diet to revise the decree of 1848, by which ey were admitted. The same journals announce that it is '\"tended to establish a central commission of police for all the states of the confederation. A congress of the principal European powers is to be held In the autumn at Frankfort, to regulate the question relative to Patents, and to draw up a treaty for causing patents granted In ^ne country to have force in all. A Hanover paper states that Prussia has presented to Aus- ria a proposition for imposing very severe regulations on the press of all Germany, and that Austria, in approving of it, as caused it to be referred to the Diet at Frankfort. The Hanoverian cabinet, it is added, is opposed to it. RUSSIA. A letter from St. Petersburgb, 3rd instant, states that an \"nperial ukase has ordered the governments of the half of the eastern part of the empire to furnish five recruits out of every thousand of the population, in order to complete the land and tea forces. PERSIA. Accounts from Teheran of the end of May state, that an officer of the imperial Russian navy had reached that capital from Arshoorada, an island in the Caspian Sea, to claim re- dress against the Turcomans inhabiting the coast near Astra- bad, who, with their flat-bottomed boats, had surprised the jarge Russian force stationed at the island, and after plunder- Ing it of stores and provisions, had carried away some of the soldiers of the garrison, with their wives and children, into slavery. I he Russians have not less than twenty ships of war and cruisers anchored off Astrabad, besides a garrison on shore, occupying strong works well mounted with artillery, whilst the urcoman craft number only six or seven, and which are no- Ullng more than eight or ten planks rudely nailed together, banned by a crew of eight, or at most ten individuals, having )10 other weapons than long spears. The Russian captives lave not since been heard 01, and most probably will be dis- Posed of at Khiva, which is the mart for Turcoman plunder, and where slaves fetch a good price. Under such circumstances, the Russian commodore seems to have manifested unusual moderation in merely sending an pfticer to the Shah of Persia to claim redress. Ilis Majesty \"said to have refused the Russian minister's demand that the resident Governor of Mazanderan should be dismissed, as the supposed instigator of the attack, though he has consented to prohibit this official from visiting the coast, as he was in the habit of doing. The youthful Shah of Persia has left Teheran for Ispahan, On a tour of pleasure, and which he has made arrangements for extending over a period of eight months. His Majesty is accompanied by the ministers of England, Russia, and Turkey, the whole of his court, and the royal harem, besides a large body guard of infantry and cavalry. INDIA AND CHINA.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. THE FRENCH REPUBLIC. It is evident that the partizans of the Elysee are anything but sanguine as to the disposition of the Assembly to revise the Constitution, in such a sense as shall secure to the Presi- dent the prolongation of his powers. M. de Lamartine, in the Pays, declares himself an advocate or the revision of the constitution, provided such revision shall be made legally and not to the exclusive interest of any man or party, and that it shall be preceded by a return to universal sufloage, thus leaving to the people at large the free exercise of the sovereign right to appoint a constituency, with full powers to revise the Constitution on safe republican bases. Much regret is felt at Grenoble,\" says the Bulletin de Paris, that a great number of the officers of the National Guards should have given in their resignation, in consequence of the suspension of the colonel; for the government will pro- bably feel itself compelled to disband the whole of the Na- tional Guard of the place.\" Out of 168 officers of the National Guard of Grenoble, 102 resigned. The Moniteur of Sunday contains a decree, dissolving the National Guard of Grenoble. The Paris correspondent of the Independance of Brussels, writing on the 8th, says There has been a good deal of talk to-day, of a letter received by a young member ol the right, stating that an interview had taken place between the Duke d'Aumale and Count de Chambord. at Milan. The former, if the receiver of the letter is to be believed, declared himself completely subjugated; and even added this familiar phrase, which is singular as an eutogium\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd' The Prince com- pletely humbugged me,' (Le Prince m' a completement blague). You will believe what you will of this strange piece of news; I repeat only what is said.\" The same writer also says \"It appears that the affair of M. Changarnier and M. Ledru Rollin (the invasion of England by the former, at the head of 12.000 men, to establish a Republic), will give rise to discus- sion in the tribune or the press. It is affirmed that M. Jules Favre. who was present at the nocturnal interview of the gene- ral and the ex-minister of the interior of the revolution, is to give explanations.\" We find the following in the Assemblee National\" Count de Dietrichstein, who, until the events of 1848, filled with so much distinction the post of Austrian ambassador at the Eng- lish Court, has been for the last two days at Paris. The visit ot this diplomatist is, it is said, connected with the project of the incorporation of the non-Germon provinces of the Austrian monarchy into the German Confederation. The last of 'he Paris races took place in the Champ de Mars, on Sunday. Just before the hour fixed for the com- mencement of business, there was a heavy fall of rain. which deterred a vast number of persons from attending but, as the weather became fine afterwards, a considerable crowd gra- dually assembled, and. before the races were over, nearly the whole of the course was lined with spectators. Within the ropes there was a tolerable show of carriages, though it was not equal to what is witnessed on more favourable occasions. The stands were about two-thirds full, but there were very few ladies in them. The members of the Jockey Club, and other Bporting characters, as usual, mustered in full force. SPAIN. The Queen Mother has sustained < painful accident. In getting out of her carriage at Aranjuez, her foot slipped, and the broke her leg. No danger is apprehended. The Queen was not allowed by her physicians to leave Madrid to visit her mother, that the hopes of the nation may not be exposed to be blighted by the hazards of an anxious journey. Etpartero has written to his friend Becerra, the chairman of the Progresista electoral committee, emphatically disavow- ing all alliance with the republicans. The latter, therefore refuse to vote for the old progresistas, or monarchic liberals. PORTUGAL. The Madrid journals of the 6th instant, state that a tele- graphic dispatch had beenlreceived from Lisbon, stating that the Queen of Portugal has nominated the Marquess Saldanha President of the Council of Ministers. This appointment is affirmed to have resulted from a communication from the King Consort to the Queen, to the effect that he could not rely upon the army under his command. This intelligence has caused a great sensation in the political circles of Madrid, and it was feared that the successful insurgents would not be satis- fied with a ministerial change, but would insist on the abdica- tion of the Queen in favour of the Prince Royal. The Spa. niah government were seriously thinking of stationing a corps of observation on the frontier of Portugal, not with the inten- tion of interfering with that country, but of preventing the re- volutionary spirit extending to Spain. A ic-sfrom Lisbon, of the 7th, give the following as the lis 0' rlio neiv ministry \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdPrrsident of the council, Saldanha Inti i ioi, Finance, Francini; Justice, Ferrar Foreign attaint, Count de Lavradio Marine, Viscount de Sa. The abdication of Donna Maria was spoken of at Lisbon. ITALY. The Paris Ordre states that it was currently reported in Paris that tbe King of Naples was dead. The Queen of Naples was safely delivered of a Prince on the 27th ult. The Risorgimento of the 6th states that the military league between Rome, Tuscany, Modena, and Parma, will probably be concluded very shortly. According to this plan, 20.000 Neapolitan troops are to occupy the Tuscan and Pontifical States, in order not to leave the French an excuse for a pro- longed stay at Rome. A letter from Rome, dated May 1st, says that the President of the Propaganda Cardinal Franzoni, has just issued an ap peal to all Italy, calling upon all good catholics to subscribe funds for the erection of a Roman Catholic cathedral in Lon- don. The appeal issued some months back by the Cardinal Vicar general, did not produce the desired result. A Roman correspondent states, in his letter of the 4th, that the Austrian commandant of Forli had caused a young boy to be flogged to death for accidentally killing his dog with a stone. Count Nobili, the Austrian governor of Bologna, had issued a notice on the 27th ult., menacing with the bas- tinado all who were caught in preventing the inhabitants from smoking, and stating that all such offences, having a po litical aim, are liable to be punished by court-martial- On the 26th. four peasants were shot at Forlimpopoli for having given shelter to part of the Passatore's band. GERMANY. The Prussian Chambers were prorogued on the 9th, with a speech of the President to the council, containing these pas- sages \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The retrospect of the session is calculated to confirm the assurance that the old Prussian spirit is still powerful in the forms which, under your co-operation, have become the con stitution of the country, and that the chief condition of the developement of Prussia on its historical, basis has remained unaffected by the confusions of the time. The enemies of this developement, who are the enemies of divine and human order in general, certainly rest as little as the passions by which they are agitated. But revolution, vberever and under whatever form it may appear, will find Prussia armed, and the government watchful and firm. \"The threatening attitude of this enemy, irrespective of other grounds, renders it the imperative duty of all the Ger- man governments no longer to leave Germany without a cen- tral organ, generally recognised both within Germany itself, and by foreign powers. Whether the German governments now return to the form of the older Constitution oi the Bund, or whether the plans, by no means abandoned, of a new organization of that con stitution, will be realised in a practicable form, the independent developement of Prussia shall not thereby be in any way en- dangered. But the true and silent guarantee for a happy and glorious future for our country, its political and material welfare, its increasing internal prosperity, and its influence and power abroad, you will. with his Majesty's government, find in the unwearied holding together and co-operation of all those who unite in truth and faith, under the motto of a great and glo rious era-\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd' With God for King and Fatherland The President then declared, in the name of the King, that the session wall closed. The Lloyd announces the arrival at Vienna of an English courier, with important dispatches for the Emperor, The cabinet of St. James's, it is said, consents to consider the ques- tion of the entry of all Austria into the Confederation as an internal affair, if all the States coincide on that point. RUSSIA AND POLAND. An imperial ukase has been published at St. Petersburgh, declaring Poland to be the 16th postal district of Russia. About three weeks ago, as some boatmen were dredging in the river Zbruez. which sepatates Gallician from Russian Po- dolia, they came on a colossal statue in stone, which they suc- ceeded in bringing safe to land. The height is about 18 feet, and the figure has four heads, covered with curly hair, and without beard. It was recognised immediately to be the re- presentation of Svantovit. one of the principal gods of the old Sclavonian race. It is supposed to have lain in the water 'or at least ten centuries, and is in excellent preservation, nothing being wanting except the bow and horn. the former from the right hand, and the second from the left. I his divinity had a celebrated temple at Arkona, in the isle of Rugen, where human victims were sometimes offered up. The temple, reo markable for the wealth which it contained, was destroyed in 11,68 by Waldemar I., King of Denmark. This statue, which is the only one extant of the divinity, has been presented by Count Potoski, on whose ground it was found, to the Univer- sity of Cracow. PERSIA. M The English commissioner charged with regulating the boundaries between Turkey and Persia, having proceeded to Shuster, the ancient Suza. tbe winter residence of the Kings of Persia, caused excavations to be made there, and came on some columns sixty feet in length, and six in diameter. He also discovered a tomb, and the mummy of a woman with a bracelet on the arm, and a cornelian and agate necklace round the neck. A weekly newspaper, in the Persian language, is now regu- larly published at Teheran. It is the first periodical ever pub- lished in the Persian empire. TURKEY. The cessation of the blockade of Samos has been officially announced by the Porte. Chekib Effendi has been nominated commissioner to the Danubian Provinces. One hundred and twenty Greek families have sought refuge in the Turkish ter. ritory, from tho tyranny of the Greek government. WEST INDIES. The royal mail steam-ship Great Western has brought ad. vicss from Jamaica to the 12th ult., and the other islands to corresponding dates.

The French papers have been chiefly occupied, dnriog the past few davs, in recounting tha progress of the t re- sident through the country, and the reception he met wllh, which is generally described as being most cordial. It is stattd ihat m consequence of the improvad feeling at Lyons the Pre- .idem has resolved to raise the state of seige which has existed there since the month of June. GERMANY. We find that preparations have been made, on a rather exten- give scale, for the third Congress of the Peace Association, to be holden this time in the imperial metropolis of Germany. By a somewhat unfortunate arrangement, however, the building selected as the rendezvous of the advocates of arbitration is that very St. Paul's Church which was the scene of the Federative Parliament, the Parliament of stormy discussions and no results, the Parliament of illusions and disappointments. Thecncum- siaoce is unpropitious. Howbeit, time alone can demonstrate whether the meeting held on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. (to-day,) will prove as barren of all good effects as the Assem- bly presided over by Von Gagern. Intelligence from Frankfort, of the 13 b inst., states that the Austrian Vice-Governor, Von Meiieu?, had arrived there the previous morning, and, in conformity with his instructions from Vienna, had threatened to take measures in opposition to the passage of Baden troops, which had been announced. He had, meanwhile, communicated with the Bund Commission, and it was announced that an agreement had been come to, to the effect that the BadCD troops, expected to arrive on the 13th, or the next day. should land at Weissenau, should pass round the fortress, and embark again beyond it. The Vice-Govemor bad returned to Maitia with this proposal. DENMARK AND THE DUCHIES. TheStadthotderate of Sthleswig-Holsteio has received the following communication from the Senate of Hamburgh HAMBURGH, AUG. 9.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIn order to define the position which Hamburgh intends to assume towards both parties, in regard to its coasts, harbourt, and ports. on the resumption of hostilities between the Danish Monarchy and the Duchies of Sclileswig and Holslein, the Senate has the honour to bring to the know- ledge of the High Stadtholderate, the principles upon which the Hamburgh competent authorities ate directed to act, in case of need. Armed or merchant vessels belonging to either party are to be coosidered as those of friendly states. Vessels seekiog refuge and asylum within the Hamburgh territory, whether from the dsngeis of the sea or to escape from pursuit, will not be refused entrMce. But, on the other haod, the vessels of neither one nor the other can be permitted to bring in armed or merchant piizes in say of these harbours, unless stnrm, or other accident occur nag from injuries by sea, and not the risks of war, shall require sach vessels to seek refuge. \"The Senate soizes this opportunity, &c. (Signed) TUB SENATE, &C.\" By advices from Rendsburg, of the 13th instant, it appears ttete had been no movcment of any kind at the outposts of the two armies, nor any change in the position of the troops. A body of soldiers were still at work clearing away the ruins of the labaratory the Eyder was being dragged, and several bodies have been recovered but all who are missing are not yet so- couated for. Repairs of the damage done by the explosion in the town are proceeding but slowly, as there is a scarcity of wcleriaU and workmen. THF. UNITED STATES.

Business throughout the Union has been improving. The Georgia and Cheroke steamers have arrived in New York from California, with three million dollars in gold dust. The prospect of produce in the mines appears to be most gratifying. The cotton market at New York on the 8th was somewhat inactive. Cotton declined l-c.

Cholera has broken out in A'exandiia.\" We extract the following from the Madras Alheneeum of the 9ib of July :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd \"The course of Indian history during the past month has been uninterrupted. \"The departure of the Commander-in-Chief takei place about October next. The cause of Sir Charles's eaily resignation of bis high and important office, for which no other officer possesses superior, we may almost say equal, fitness, has given rise to volu- minous speculation, the latest, and what is generally believed to be the correct explanation of the mystery, referring it to an as. sumption of authority on his part, beyond the limits of his office. His Excellency conceives that his authority extends to the decision of all purely military questions, without reference to the bead of the Government, and to two or three casts that have coma before him bu reduced his theory to practice. One 01 these was the disbanding of the 66th Bombay Native Jofantry- ft measure which is laid to have been resolved on and promul- gated, without once consulting ihe opinion of ihe Gov.-General, who, while willing to defer to the superior military judgment and experience of the head of the army, could not allow his own precedence to be thus openly slighted without a protest. It is accordingly believed that the Gov. General addressed an official wigging to Sir Charles Napier, on bis undue assumption of authority, which led his Excellency to tender his resignation. It has been remarked, that it is highly to the (iov.-Geneiil's credit that he did not show his resentment by cancelling Sir Charles Napier's orders, but, putting aside all peisonal feeling, only considered the public service, which would have suffered from an open c'ashiog of authorities, and the consequent uncer- tainty which must in future have prevailed lIS to the vahdity of any unusual order. The Commander in Chief's proceedings have been confirmed, hut he retires.' With regard io our troublesome neighbours on the north- weat frontier, the Afreedees, the pastes can no longer be consi- dered secure. Of this a striking example has just been afforded in th very narrow escape of Lieut. Pollock and Mr. Brand Sapte, Assistant Commissioners, and Lieut. Miller, of the Guide Corps, who had commenred a journey on horseback through the pass from Peshawur to Kohat, but were fortunately stayed in time from proceeding at the certain loss of their lives. The officer commanding at Kohat, Captain Coke, having received intelligence that a plot had been formed by the people to waylay and murder the travellers, sent off a messenger at once to warn them of the impending danger, and thus, as was proved bey, nd a doubt by subsequent inquiries, saved them from a cruel death. Speedy measures will have to be adopted for the effectual punish- ment of these barbarians, and the news of another expedition into the hills for its infiicuon will not occasion surprise. In the Punjsub itself, the evidence of a happy but gradual emergence from the misery and confusion of anarchy to the rtgu- larity, security, and peaceful prosperity uf a well ordered and paternal Government, are daily becoming more apparent. Un- dertaking* of public utility, roads, bridges, canals, wcrksof irri- gation are in piogress, testifying 10 the desire of the new rulers to make up, if possible, for years of past neglect, and revive once more that former flourishing condition, of which the tokens everywhere strike the eye of the observing traveller.\" AFFGHANISTAN.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOur latest intelligence hence is derived from the Lahore Chronicle, and is briefly to the effect that the Cabu- lese. after having leceived several checks in their invasion of Bulkh and Khooloom, had again been blessed with the smiles 01 fortune. The troops of Bokhara had been defeated signally by Sirdar Mahomed Atram Khan, Dost Mahomed s eldest son, and had in consequence evacuated the provinces in question. NurAirL.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd-N i> political news from this quarter, of any interest, that is authentic. Reports go that the Ranee Chunda is sull at large, and busily engaged in intrigues against our Government. Judging from the well-known tact and ialei.1 of our present lesi dent at Katmuda, she must be thoroughly watched, and her in. tricate web peiiodically swept away to her particular annoyance. The Friend of India, a few weeks ago, first published a report that the Ranee bad escaped to England in the train of tbe Napaul Commander-in-Chief. But so B-eadily are the I-cfs of the fugi- t ve Seikhs over Indis turned to Nepaul, trial, considering their A titude for intrigue, it is impossible not to feel sure that a master- bond thence suggests their movements. BURBAM.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThere it a domeitic war io the neighbourhood of Ava, of the progress of which no distinct accounts reach us. One of the princes of the blood royal, a brother of the reigning monarch, lately left Ava, and without leave from the Lord of the White Elephant, retired to the Shan States, which are in the neighbourhood of our.Tenasserim provinces. As a number of people resorted thither to him, commands were issued for his return to the capital, which being disobeyed, recourse was had to arms. Newt received from Ava, on the 5ih June, at Rangoon, anoeuored the capture of the Prince, but no reliance is to be placed on it, it being very conflicting, as the precaution adopted by the Rangoon authorities have not been lelaxed.

Mr. Smith, ofDeanston, who was known extensively in agri- cultuial circles, being himself a celebrated agriculturist, was ound dead in his bed a few days since, at the house of his cousin, Mi-.

Fresh butter sold at Hereford, last week, at 5d. per lb., and at Taunton at 6d.-At Newport, it is double the latter price A sturgeon, weighing from 80 to lOOlbs. was on Friday, caught in the river Wye at Hoarwithy, a few miles below Hereford. The creature, when placed upon a table, presented the appearance of a huge pie. Mr. Theobald's stag-hounds, we hear, have been sold to a foreign nobleman. The most cheering accounts of the potatoe crop and the wheat harvest of this year, are received from Ireland. We trust anticipations may be fulfilled tenfold. The Pasha of Egypt having learned that in England it is the custom to give dinner parties to friends, has consequently ordered every pasha and beg to invite the members of his family and his relatives to dinner one day in each week. Owing to the low price of veal at present, which renders it unprofitable for dairymen to raise their calves, six perfectly healthy animals were sold in our market on Tuesday last for 6 \u00c2\u00a3 d. each.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdSalisbury Guardian.

A vessel arrived from Stettin has brought the large quantity of 225 puncheons of potatoe spirit, consigned, and also 135 casks of potatoe flour, the produce and manufacture ot Prussia. The Dutch vessel Burgemeister Hnedltofer, arrived from Hjerting, has brought 178 head of oxen, the produce of Holland. lliis is the largest individual arrival of horned cattle from abroad which has taken place during the present season. a r 1 Considerable sensation has been caused in the City by the finding of bills of indictment at the Old Bailey against some of the principal officers of the docks, for frauds on the revenue on which bills the parties have been held to bail. It ts understood that the prosecution is at the instance of the Customs authorities. One day last week, a hatter of Armagh, M' Mullan, walke a distance of 15 miles in three hours, one-half of the distance backwards. As a proof of altered times, this arduous feat was performed for the sake of a trifle afterwards collected. Upwards of forty miles of railway work were, it is said, let by the directors of the Great Northern Railway company, last week, for considerably under \u00c2\u00a35,000. An Essex paper, after referring to the hitherto mysterious absence of Mr. James Rickards from the town of Maiden, states that it is now accounted for by the discovery that he is an alleged defaulter in his accounts as collector to the Essex Provident Society. According to a report in the Atheneum, derived from Ger- man sources, an uniortunate tenor was recently compelled to appear in Lucia, the opera of Trapani, when suffering under the immediate agony of his mother's death. As he sang the last scene he stabbed himself to the heart. Mr. Edward Martindale of Stockdalewath, has three cows of the short horned breed, which have produced him six calves this season. One of them had two in the year 1848 and what is more remarkable, they were all heifer calves. Last month a South Lancashire beerhouse-keeper, whilst drunk and jealous, beat his wife. sold her to another man for a pint of ale, and then turned his wife and purchaser out of doors together. Mr. Cunningham, a midshipman of her Majesty's ship Arethusa, was killed last week, by falling from the mainmast, whilst lying in the port of Lisbon. A RATHER EXPENSIVE SPEECH.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAt the late Protectionist meeting, held in the amphitheatre, arrangements were made which the projectors of the meeting anticipated would have brought the proceedings to a termination before five o'clock, thus enabling the usual dramatic representation taking place in the evening. In this, however, they were mistaken. Hall- an hour was allotted to Mr. G. F. Young, but that gentleman, instead of confining himself to the period allowed him, ad- dressed the meeting for nearly an hour and a half; and although the other speakers kept within the prescribed limits of time, it was nearly half past MX o'clock before the meeting was brought to a close. The evening's performance was thus prevented taking place and as the engagement of the Amphitheatre is always accompanied by a stipulation that its use beyond five o'clock will subject the party occupying it to a fine of \u00c2\u00a340. in compensation for the loss likely to arise from non-performance, a demand was made for this sum, which was instantly paid. A representation has since been made to Mr. Young on the subject, but whether he has con- sented to bear the extra expense incurred by his prolixity we were unable to learn.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLiverpool Times. STAHTUNG RUMOUR WTH REFEIIENCE TO THE BIsHOP OF EXKTEK.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe statement we are about to make seems very improbable, but for the accuracy of our informant, 80 far as facts come from him, we are ready to *ouch. A gentleman was visiting last week in the North of England amongst highly respectable Roman Catholic families, when he met some leading Romish clergymen, who were speaking with the utmost confidence of the Bishop of Exeter being about to secede to the Roman Catholic church, and, on his exptessing very great doubts as to the probability of such au event, he was assured that the Rev. J. H. Newman, the well-known Oxford convert to Rome, and who has a ministerial charge in that neighbourhood, had that morning left for Torquay on a visit, by invitation, to the Bishop. Of course Mr. Newman may pay a visit to the Bishop, and the Bishop have no idea of going over to Rome still there is a startling signi- ficance about such a conjunction at this time.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBristol Paper. GOOD WATEK v. BEER.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBesides the immense benefits of soft water in processes of cleansing and of manufacture, the encouragement to temperance in the supply of so pleasant and wholesome beverage is not to be despised, and is what the Londoners have Jittle conception of. Strangers who come to the metropolis from localities where so salubrious a draught as pure and even moderately soft water is customaiy. are horrified in dunking the metropolitan water, with a feeling as if the draught were a mere solution of lime, giving as JlttJe gratification, or quenchment of thirst, as the parched throat of the dreamer of draughts of water feels after swallowing imaginary bucketfuls. Hence it is that the metropolitans, knowing nothing of the delights of water drinking, have a settled but mistaken idea that it is water in the abstract that is unfit for human drinking. Hence it is that brewers make hundreds of thousands for their heirs tothraw away.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Builder. STRAM FROM GLASGOW TO NEW YORK. The new Bcrew steam-ship City of Glasgow sailed from Glasgow on Friday, on her second trip to New York. The City carries a (ul cargo of light valuable goods, and all her berths are also taken up.

Guizot, says that Count Nesselrode has addressed a circular to the Ruslian representatives at Naples, Florence, and Rome, informing them that Austria, Prussia, and Russia, bad resolved upon placing at the disposal of those Governments such aid as they might require against revolutionary movements. Thus, ac- cording to the interpretation of this journal, the Northern Courts have formed an anti-revolutionary league, rendered necessary by the audacious and hypocritical enterprises of ihe English Government against the peace of the continent, which it is English policy to keep in a constant state of revolutionary agitation.\" We read in the Patrie A report has been in circula'ion that the cholera had made its appearance at the Hospital of Bicetre, but it is perfectly without foundation. From a report made by Dr. Emery, member of the Conseil de Salubrite, it appears that from the 24th to the 28th ult., fifteen persons had been attacked with symptoms resembling cholera, but that on the 1st the whole of them had been cured. There was nothing in these cases to lead to the supposition of the return of the epidemic disease which raged in Paris in previous years.\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Moniteur du, Soir states that the malady in ques- tion was influenza. The reception of the President of the Republic, at Chatelherhault, was by no means flattering, and ihe inhabi- tants of that locality are by no means favourably disposed to a prolongation of his powers. His supporters on his arrival raised a cry of Vive Napoleon,\" which was instantly drowned by crieslof Vive La Republique. raised by the assembled'popu- lation of the district, who continued cheering for the Republic until the President had taken bis departure and was out of hearing. The Patrit, the organ of the Elysle, denounces the scenes which took place at Chatelherhault, as disgraceful.\" A serious accident took place on Saturday night on the Lyons Railway, near Tonnerre. The train from Chalons was run into by an engine coming down the road, and the driver of which had fallen asleep. Almost all the carriages were upset, and 15 passengers injured so severely that they were obliged to be left at Tonnerre. The Moniteur states that this account has been much exaggerated several passengers received slight bruises only, and the train met with little delay. GERMANY. We find .the following in the Patrie We have announced that the Senate of Hamburgh had remonstrated with the Cabinet aJf^ Vienna against the occupation of that city by Austrian troops. Prince de Schwartzenburg has replied that his Government had only to consider the interests of the defence of the territory and of order, and that those interests called Ibr the maintenance of that occupation, and consequently be refused to accede to the demand made by the Senate of Hattifc irgh.\" A letter from Frankfort of the 1st in the Independance of Brussels, says It is believed Austria will contract a loan of from 60,000,000 to 100,000,000 florins. The Austrian funds will therefore probably advance considerably, as the consolidation of a great part of the floating debt is expected. A Berlin letter of the 3rd states that the Zollverein is about TU PROP\u00c2\u00b08E to Belgium a commercial treaty on a new basis.

The ordeis by letters from England are unusually large, but the scarcity of vessels rather limits business.

The Bosphorus arrived at Plymouth on Monday, from the Cape of good Hope, which she left on the 31st of May. The aspect of affairs seems to have taken no definite turn in favour of either party. It was expected that by the time of the departure of the next packet, some more decisive movement will have been made by Sir Harry Smith. The following is the summary of the Cape Mail Monthly Despatch CAPE TOWN, FRIDAY, MAY 30.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\"The aspect of the war has undergone little alteration since our last publication, and we regret to say that we have still no decisive success to re- cord. or in fact anything that would lead to the speedy termination of the present disastrous state of affairs. The system of patrols has been continued, the Amatola mountains have been repeatedly penetrated, and their fast Des\u00c3\u00b8es explored by the British troops, who have endured great fatigue and displayed all their usual enery and gallantry but the enemy, like the children of the mist, vanish on their approach, driving off their cattle. In fact, as Sir H. G. Smith observes, we have to deal with a foe who acknowledges neither front, flank, nor rear, and whose movements are too rapid and eccentric to be calculated upon. The number of plundering parties of Kaffirs within the colony have greatly increased, probably in consequence of the privations which they suffer in the bush. Fortunately the 74th regiment landed at Port Elizabeth and proceeded to Graham's Town, so that there will be a larger military force than heretofore within the colony, to second the efforts of the burghers and the faithful coloured inhabitants. The 300 men who arrived in the Dee, have joined Sir H. G. Smith at King William's Town. These reinforcements are, however, inadequate for the pur- pose, looking at the extended line of frontier along which operations must be carried on. A couple more regiments of infantry, one of light dragoons, and above all, some com- panies of the rifle brigade, with proportionate artillery, will probably be required before the hall-barbarous tribes in our vicinity can be sufficiently impressed with the power of Great Britain, for any lasting and satisfactory peace to be con- cluded. The following is a summary of the proceedings of the var- ious patrols during the month. On the 28th April, Colonel Mackinnon marched with 2,200 men, and two six-pounders,in the A matola mountains, by way of the Keiskamma Hock, while Major Wilmot proceeded with 700 men, into Stock. Tolo's and Seyolo's country, to harrass those chiefs and their people. Colonel Mackinnon returned on the 30th, with 400 head of cattie and a number of horses he had been attacked on his leturn by a very large- combined force of Gaikas and Hottentots, who made most determined efforts to retake the cattle they were, however beaten off, after a severe conflict, in which they are supposed to have suffered an unusually heavy loss that of the English column was four killed (including three privates of the 73d regiment), and eleven wounded. The Kaffirs had early intelligence of the march of the troops, and there was no Burgher force on the further side of the Amatolas o intercept their cattle, or it is probable that many more might have been taken. Umhala, on hearing the firing during the engagement, sent his great son, his nephew, and his counsellor and speaker \"Soubati,\" into King William's Town, to beg Sir H. Smith to put an end to the war. The following day Colonel Mackinnon again marched to. wards the Keiskamma Hock, by way of the camp, near Bailey's grave, burning the kraals of Sandilli's brother Klu Klu, devastating the country, and returned without having r met with any opposition from the Kaffirs, who witnessed his proceedings from the neighbouring heights- Major Wilmot successfully performed the service for which he was detached and returned to King William's Town on the 3rd of May, a few hours after colonel Mackinnon. While near Fort Wilt shire, he was smartly fired upon by a party of Kaffirs, who had taken possession of a ruined loop-holed tower, which commanded the road and fort; they were, however, dislodged without loss to the attacking party. On the 4th and 5th the fail of snow occurred, which put a stop to military operations for a day or two but on the 8th Colonel Mackinnon was again in motion with a strong patrol, proceeding to Toise's kraal, on the Kalusi, and from thence to the junction of the Doom and Thomas Rivers he returned to Toise's kraal on the 11th, while the cavalry under Lieu tenant-Colonel Napier swept the country round. On the 13th the patrol marched to Dohne's station large herds of cattle were seen on the other side of the Kei, but the Colonel's in- structions prevented his crossing that river-the cavalry and Cape Mounted Rifles, however, succeeded io capturing 300 head and the patrol returned on the 16th. \\flinr Wilmot, who marched on the same day as Colonel '\u00e2\ufffd\u00a0 \u00c2\u00bb1 sn nenetraled the Amatolas, by way of the Mackinnon, had ,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdrnp(i (0 King William's Town on the Kabouie Neck, and leturnel General Somerset had been 13th, with fifty head of cattle Gener^ .n on patrol in the Bimkwater, i.nE far to weak (about want of reinforcements, his \u00c2\u00b0rc \u00c2\u00ab\u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 and Hottentots about 900 men only) to act against the Ka his absence from the Kat river, and the Tambo\u00c2\u00b0k\u00c2\u00bbeB. ur hot 0j Fort Hare, the Kafflrs attacked a dwelling the P\u00c2\u00b0st> frontier post has arrived, Since writing the above, .n waKgons was bringing little further 'nte \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Kowie mouth, by a strong threatened on their way from the Kow^e n d body of Kaffirs; but, being e ]oRg range r,fles, they some first-rate shots, a1\"1\" e ox.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. The Paris papers of Friday state that although the rumours respecting a change of Ministry have been contradicted by the Patrie, they still find credit at the Bourse, and the opinion is very general that Louis Napoleon will propose a change of the Electoral Law immediately after the rejection of the next pro- posiiion for the revision of the Constitution. M. de Girardin, M. de Lamartine, and M.

'I he I rench Ambassador to the Frankfort Diet has returned to Paris to take the instructions of his Government with respect to some of the great measures before the Diet. Austria persists in the principle of her demand for admission with all her States, and will only consent to delay on the sub- ject, not to the abandonment of the demand. The Paris journals of Saturday and of Monday state that the rumours of a division in the Cabinet have now acquired a consistency which leaves no doubt as to their truth indeed the organs of the Ministry are themselves compelled to admit that there is some foundation for these rumours thus we read in the Patrie \"A good deal has been said of a Ministerial crisis, occa- sioned by a difference of opinion between the President and the Cabinet on an important point of general policy. If we are well informed, there only took place a serious conversa tion in the Council of Ministers on the levy of the 31st of May. Nevertheless, no determination on their future con- duct will be adopted unt 1 Tuesday next. It is on that day the President, who has not as yet manifested his intentions, will make known his decision.\" There have been some serious disturbances at Montleacon. We have received the Paris journals of yesterday. It is considered certain that MM. Leon Faucher and Car- lier will quit office, and that their resignations will probably be accompanied by that of M Buffet, of the office of Minister of Commerce, and that of General Randon, of that of Minister of War. M. Romieu, the author of the Era of the Caesars.\" who declares that military despotism is the best form of go. vernment, is spoken of as the successor of M. Cailier. General Santa Cruz, Minister Plenipotentiary of Bolivia, returned to Paris last evening, after six weeks' absence, em- ployed in visiting England and Belgium. Count Bathyany has taken a small apartment in the Champs Elys6es. and proposes to live in the strictest retirement. The Assemblte Nationale has the following brief remarks on the Ministerial crisis All the reports in circulation re- lative to Ministerial combinations should be received with great reserve. If we are well informed, the President is more undecided than ever, and the nearer the day approaches when he is to pronounce his final determination, the more he desires to postpone any decision on the law of May 31, and on the change of Ministry. It must nevertheless be admitted that a conviction is felt at the Elysee, that the Cabinet is much shaken, and that, under any circumstances, the opening of the Parliament cannot arrive without material modifications being made in it.\" The Journal des Debats. in a few words, con- firms the above account so far as to no decision having been come to. SPAIN. Madrid journals of the 6th and 7th have arrived. The Gaceia publishes a decree convoking the Cortes for the 5th November. American prisoners from Cuba, to the number of 126, have arrived at Vigo, to undergo their sentence of hard labour in the mints. The Heraldo states that a Ministerial crisis has arisen owing to the Minister of Marine. General Armero, having offered his resignation but it adds in a postscript that the General has, on the solicitation of the Marquis de Miraflores, Minister for Foreign Affairs, consented to retain his portfolio for the present. The cause of M. Armero s wish to retii^ is said to be his opposition to granting certain recompenses demanded by the Captain-General of Cuba to the persons who distin- guished themselves in resisting the invasion of the bands of Lop .1; the Minister of War and the majority of the other Ministers being of opinion that the tecompenses ought to be accorded. There is no other news of political importance in the Spanish journals. The English fleet arrived in the poit of Rosas on the 30th ult., and was to remain eight days. Admiral Parker and his family had frequently landed. PORTUGAL. Accounts have been received from Lisbon of the 9th. The Queen was confined of a still-born child on the 7th. The Duke of Terceira still continued a member of the Ca- bralist Election Committee. No fresh cases of yellow fever had occurred at Oporto for ten days. GERMANY. According to the Debats the German Diet has not taken in good part a note by which Lord Palmerston, in forwarding through Lord Cowley copies of Mr. Gladstone's letter to Lord Aberdeen, invited the Diet to join in a remonstrance to the King of Naples The Count de Thun, on the 2Uth of Sep tember, moved the Diet to reject the proposition ot the British Minister, and the Diet conformably agreed to a reply to the effect that the note of Lord Palmerston was unprecedented. and contrary to the international relations of Governments, and that, moreover, if the Diet should allow itself to interfere in the internal relations of the Neapolitan Government, it would be authorising other Governments to meddle with the affairs of the German Confederation. On the 3d inst. the Diet resolved to address to the Hano- verian Government a communication, calling on it to abstain from any further proceedings in the provincial affairs till the matter had been discussed by the Diet. In the same sitting, in consequence of the resolution of the 28th of August, a Commission was appointed to examine into the several Con- stitutions of the S ales of the Confederation, and to inquire whether they were compatible with the principles of the Con- stitution of the Confederation. This Commission is composed of the Envoys of Austria Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Hesse, and Mecklenburgh. f A Frankfort journal of the 11th states that more political arrests have been made at Hamburgh. The engineer of the English steamer the Elbe having been arrested, and his papers seized, there was found in them some information which led to several other arrests. The King of Prussia arrived at Pillnitz on the 7th, where the King of Saxony is at present. The Fosf Gazette, of Berlin, states that the Prussian Cham- bers are to meet on Nov. 20. A letter from Berlin states that the German Diet have authorised the different States of Germanv to abolish the censorship of the press, provided due provision be made by the law against the abuse of liberty. The Rostock Gazette, under date of Frankfort. 6th instant, says that, in its sitting of the 3d, the Germanic Diet had named a commission, composed of Austria, Prussia, Bavana, Saxony, and the Grand Duchies of Hesse and Mecklenburgh, charged to examine the constitutions of the different States, and to make propositions on the subject. ITALY. The Milan Gazette of the 7th inst. announces that the jour- nal It Tetoro had been suspended by order of the military com- mander of Lombardv, whilst the country continued in a state I of tiege, because its responsible editor, notwithstanding fIe- quent admonitions, had inserted articles on questions which he was not authorised to treat. On the 6th the Council of War of Milan sentenced Vasini Pasquale, a Piedmontese weaver, 29 years of age, to six months' imprisonment, for having clandestinely imported pro- hibited political works into Lombardy; Frezzi Giovanni, a Milanese porter, aged 34, to the same penalty, for having in his possession the barrel of a musket; Bonfico Carlo, a Milanese operative, aged 30, to two years' hard labour, com- muted by special favour into one year's confinement, for being the owner of a sword and Galleani Antonio, of San Colom- bano, in the province of Lodi, a physician, aged 44, for hold- ing seditious language, and possessing revolutionary writings. The Piedmontese Gazette of the 10th publishes the conven- tion entered into between the Holy See, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Austria, and the Dukes of Modena and Parma, for the construction of a railway line, to be denominated the Railroad of Central Italy, which is to connect Ileggio with Bologna, Modena, and Pistoria, or Prato from Reggio it is to branch out in two different directions, one branch leading to Piacenza, the other to Mantua, The execution is to be granted to one or more companies, with privileges to last not more than one hundred years, and the guarantee of a mini- mum of interest on the capital. The companies are to allow the contracting Governments to establish telegraphic wires along the line, and are to bind themselves to transport at least one waggon per train for the account of the post-office.

EXECUTION OF A PRIEST.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA letter from Hong Kong, ad- dressed to the Univers, gives the following de'ails of the exe- cution of M. Schoffler, a Missionary Priest:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd On the 4th of May, about noon, by order of the Grand Mandarin, elephants and horses were prepared, and two re- giments of satellites were under arme. The muskets were loaded, and every one expected that it was an expedition against the rebels which was being fitted out. or that an ar. tack was to have been made on the habTTts of some brigands. It was soon, however, understood that all these preparaiions had been ordered for the execution of M. Schoffler. The Mandarin, fearing that the Christians would endeavour to rescue their missionary by force, wished to intimidate them by this display of troops. When his intentions were known, all the town showed the greatest affliction. The gaolers, the prisoners, and ait tbo\"e who had had any connection with the missionary, expressed their sorrow and regret. M. Schoffler, on the contrary, was smiling with delight, and he prepared to walk to the place of execution with greater ease by dressing himself as lightly as possible. The Mandarin was apprehen- sive of a riot, and took up his position on the ramparts, sur rounded by his troops, all ready for action. The execution took place outside the town. The cortege of the martyr was arranged in the following manner:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBefore him marched a soldier, carrying a board affixed to a pole, on which was written, 'Notwithstanding the severe prohibition against the religion of Jesus, a European priest named Augustin has dared to come here clandestinely to pieach and seduce the people. When arrested, he confessed everything his crime is evident. Let Augustin have his head cut off, and into the river. Fourth year of Tu Du first of the 1 hud Moon.' Eight soldiers, with drawn sabres, marched by the side of M. Schoffler; one hundred men, armed with mus e s ,.r lances, formed the head ol the procession, and two ele- nhants formed the rear-guard. The martyr held up his chains 1 pii walking he walked quickly, as if hastening towaids his f fmnh and continually offered up thanksgivings.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. 0 FRANCE. The Assembly on Saturday adopted by a large majority the Bill for continuing for another year the law for the suppression of clubs. In the course of the discussion, M. Jules de Las- teyrie, who supported the bill, directed the attention of the government to the proceedings of the Bonapartist club, the Society of the 10th December,\" who were the sole getters up of petitions for the prolongation of the powers of the Pre- sident. M. Bac also accused the government of partiality in passing over without notice the illegal proceedings of the Bo- napartist clubs. The committee on the revision met on Saturday. M. Payer was in favour of a Republic, and opposed to the restoration of monarchy, but he was also in favour of the re-election of the President. M. Larabit proposed to consult the nation on one point, and on one point only-the re eligibility of the Presi- dent. M.Creton proposed that that a constituent assembly should be elected to decide between the republic and the mo- narch. M. Bouhicr de L'Ecluse would have, in addition, a Provisional President, whose powers should expire when the constituents should have decided the question between republic and monarchy. Petitions, already authenticated by from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 of signatures, have even now demanded the revi- sion as a boon from the members of the democratic legislature, and within the compass of the French Parliament those very numerous petitioners are not without a band of able and reso- lute supporters. It must, therefore, be apparent to every one that the struggle is still one upon the consequences of which it would be rather rash to venture a prediction. It is said that M.Thiers is about to proceed to Vienna, where he will meet the Duke de Nemours and the Duke de Bordeaux, and make another effort to bring about a fusion. Viscount Bocarme has been condemned to death. 1-1 is wife was acquitted, and arrived in Paris on Wednesday evening; she was accompanied by her eldest daughter. They have taken up their abode at an hotel in the Faubourg Poissonieie. On Saturday, M.

The Moniteur publishes the receipts of the customs duties for the last month, which amounted to 9,072,404f., being a decrease of l,229,547f.. as compared with the corresponding month of 1850, and of J,354.007f. with that of 1849. The total receipts of the first five months of 1851 amounted to 45,498.649F. 1850, 47,147.270f., and 1849, 49/>20,3l8f. SPAIN. Madrid journali of the 18th have arrived. In the sitting of the previous day, Senor Bcrmudex de Cas- tro, as had been expected, withdrew his motion, declaring want of confidence in the ministry but not until some very angry discussion had taken place between him and the Presi- dent of the Council (Bravo Murillo). A motion, declaring that the ministry merited the confidence and support of the Chamber,\" was then presented by several ministerial deputies. It bore eighteen signatures, but only nine of them were read by the president. Senor Perez Aloe demanded that the other nine names should be read also. Senor Olzago seconded the motion, and expressed surprise at the attempt to conceal nine names from the knowledge of the chamber. The request of the opposition was at last complied with. Senor Pastor was the first to mount the tribune to speak against the vote of con- fidence. but the matter was put off to the next day. It was not, however, brought on up to post hour on the 18th, the deputies being occupied in their bureaux in electing the com- mittee on the bill for the regulation of the debt. The majo- rity of the members chosen on that measure were o' the mi- nisterial party, and, consequently, favourable to it Senor De Muroy Vidacetta has been nominated Vice-President of the Senate, in the room of the Duke de Rivas, resigned.

But, after some discussion, the chamber proceeded to the order of the day. A Florence paper, of the 16th, states that the inquiry set on foot about the origin of the disturbance at the Church of Santa Croce, has proved that no arms of any sort were used on the occasion by the parties arrested. Among the persons who have been summoned to give explanations on the subject are the Marquess of Laiatico, Count Digny, Professor Zac- netti, and Signor Cempini, formerly minister of finance. BELGIUM. The remarkable trial for murder has ended, after seventeen days' proceedings, in the conviction of Count Bocarm6, and the acquittal of the Countess. The Frocureur du Roi charged the crime on both the prisoners, the counsel of the countess on the count, and the count on the countess. The President put eight questions to the jury, four respecting M. de Bocarm6, four (precisely the same), respecting the countess. The first of these four questions was relative to the principal fact, the other to the fact of the complicity. At nine o'clock the jury retired. Scarcely a quarter of an hour had elapsed when the bell rang. A shudder ran through the immense crowd assembled in the court, as so short a delibera- tion seemed to imply a condemnation of both the accused. The jury simply demanded information on some point. At half.past ten, the jury re entered the jury box. Amidst deep silence, and in somewhat a tremulous, yet firm voice, the foreman said\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" On my honour and my conscience, and in the presence of God and man, the.reply of the jury is\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn the first question (the principal fact concerning the accused Bo- carm\u00c3\u00a9 )-guilty.\" That implies also guilty on the;three other questions of complicity. \"On the 5th. 6th, 7th, and 8ih questions (concerning Madame Bocarm\u00c3\u00a9)-not guilty.\" The President then ordered the accused to be brought into court. The count was calm and collected. Madame de Bocarm6 had her veil down, but her step was firm. On hearing the verdict of goilty, a slight momentary flush passed over the count's face, but he evinced no other sign of emotion. On hearing not guilty on his wife, an expression of internal satis- faction animated his features. lie looked affectionately to wards his wife, who gave no visible signs of emotion. She left the dock with a firm step, without speaking to her husband. The Procureur du Roi having asked the prisoner if he had anything to say, he replied No, except that I am perfectly innocent.\" He tli-,n entered calmly into conversation with his counsel. At eleven o'clock the Court pronounced sentence 01 death upon Ilippolyte Visarte de Bocarm6, and decreed that the execution should take place in one of the public squares of Mons- The priorar--Iafi -tho courts under guard, with a firm step. LIERM AIN Y. A Pmssian paper of the 21st says II A cabinet council was held to day relative to the Danish question. The go- vernment is decidedly resolved to guarantee the rights of the Duchies. Russia is said to have agreed to the proposal that the Austrian and Prussian troops shail not quit Rendsburg until it is decided that the fortress shall in future be garri- soned by Holstein troops only.\" The Equestrian Order of the Principality of Osnabruck has presented to the German Diet a complaint against the go- vernment of Hanover, for an attempt to deprive it of its con- stitutional prerogatives. The following are the propositions of the government of Hanover respecting the German fleet :-It desires, first, that the German Diet shall immediately declare the German fleet on the North Sea to be the property of the Confederation se- condly, that a commission shall be formed by the Diet to re- port on the question whether the fleet shall be kept up or not. The Chamber of Deputies of W urtemberg, on the 20th, ap- proved by 51 votes to 34, of the expenses incurred by the go- vernment from 1849 to 1851 without the authorisation of the chambers. Before this resolution was come to, two proposi- tions of the opposition, for blaming the violation of the con. stitution by the ministry, liable for any loss sustained by the treasury, were rejected. The military authorities of Austria contrive to give as much offence in Germany, as the French in Rome. At Hamburgh, several citizens have been killed in a fray with the Austrian soldiers, begun by the insolence of the latter. In Hesse Cas- Bel, the government has been compelled to grant immunities to the Roman Catholic clergy, scarcely compatible with the institutions of a Protestant country, under the compulsion of Austrian bayonets. HOLLAND. A very important change, has been introduced into the working of the business of the Second Chamber. Hitherto the reporters had merely to bring in the report containing the view* expressed in the committee, instead of which they are now to give an independent judgment of their own. In regard to the project of law on m inisterial responsi- bility, nearly all the members were agreed upon the main points. Several, however, were of opinion, that the project should be conceived in more general terms, since cases might otherwise easily arise which were not included in the project, and, consequently, not amenable to it. A minister's neglect of the interest of the state, without exactly infringing the laws, was also noticed as a point emitted. A few Deputies required that there should be a collective and political responsibility; but this objection was overruled on the ground that it was impossible for a cabinet to stand any length of time without a majority in the chambers. NORWAY. The Storthing, in its sitting on the 13th instant, adopted almost unanimously the proposition of the committee on the constitution, to repeal the second section of the fundamental law.

ROIE,-The Roman correspondent of the Daily News' states, in his letter of the 10th instant, that two Roman soldiers were shot on that mornin^, ac- cording to the sentence of a French court-martial, for assaults on French soldiers. These executions had produced a deep sensation. Hie Conservatore,' of Florence, quotes a letter from Leghorn of the 9th, giving the particulars of a dom ciliary visit mentioned as having taken place at a villa near the Condotti, inhabited by the family of the late Lord Aldborough. Notwithstanding the precautious t3ken, a person attempted to escape over the garden wall, but was arrested, and was at once identified as a native of Lucca, who had formerly served in the police corps. The inmates of the villa being summoned to open the doors in the name of the law, they answered that the house was inhabited by English subjects, and conse- quently inviolable. A long parley ensued, after which the authorities, suspecting that advantage was taken of the delay to burn papers and ottierarticIE-s,or- dered the doors to be broken open, and a similar question had to be repeated up stairs, where they found a door secured with iron bars; two persons were arrested in the act of burn- ing a mass of papers. The police found, besides a voluminous correspondence in English, a complete set of printing materials, several clandesiine publi- cations printed on the premises, and a quantityof arms. The three sons of Lord Aldborough, and the individual who had attempted to escape, were ar- rested and secured in the Fortezza Vecchia. The articles ser/.ed were put into two chests, and sealed up in the presence of the British consul, Fourteen persons more, connected with this affair, have been since arrested.

Little news is to be gleaned from the three days' papers to hand by this arrival. The Monitor Republicano' asserts that the war in Yucatan is drawing to a close. The Indians every day diminish their efforts, and their courage declines. The only thing worthy of note is the defeat of the savages at Bacalar. They endeavoured to take the place by assault, and 600 of them penetrated to the Plaza. The garrison received them with such a fire that they were utterly routed, and the river was choked up with the dead bodies. The loss of the whites is insignificant. A terrible tornado visited the city of Louisville, Kentucky, on the 17di ult. A number of buildings were levelled, and other damage done to property. Cambridge, Massachusetts, had been visited by a fire, which destroyed a great amount of property.

{"ocr": "IRELAND, AMALGAMATION OF THE RAILWAY SYSTEM IN THE NORTH.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAn important communication has been received from Lord John Russell in reply to a state- ment recently submitted to him by a numerous body of peers and members of the House of Commons connected with this country, on the subject of completing and amalgamating the railway system in the north of Ire- land. Lord John states in his letter that while go- vernment are fully sensible of the advantages which would result from the extension of railways in Ireland upon a system which would be economical, and of the peculiar advantages to be expected from connecting the centres of population and commerce with the agricul- tural districts of the province of Ulster, they do not conceive themselves warranted in supporting any scheme based upon advances to be made from the public funds. But,\" his lordship continues, if it shall be made apparent to them that a scheme, similar to the one which is recommended in the memorial, is generally desired as the best means of providing railway com- munication in Ireland, or in the province of Ulster, her Majesty's government will be disposed to lend their assistance in obtaining legislative authority for estab- lishing such a system. They understand the principle of the proposed system to be, that the interested locali- ties should be responsible, and should guarantee such a security upon their rates as will induce private capi- talists to supply the neeesscry funds They are of opinion that such a measure should only be carried into effect upon a decided expression on the part of counties or districts of their willingness to be rated to the extent required for the construction and maintenance of the railway in which they may be interested. It appears also essential that a sinking fund should in all cases be provided for the redemption of the debt, and that no guarantee for promoting railways should, together with any other existing liabilities, be allowed to exceed a certain proportion upon the value assessed. THE CHARGE AGAINST MR. BLOOD SMITH.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThis gentleman, a magistrate of the county of Clare, charged with conspiring to procure the murder of his mother, was acquitted by the jury on Saturday last. By the evidence produced for the defence it appeared that, during the very time when it was alleged that Mr. Smith was con 'octing the conspiracy, he was actually engaged in proceedings to evict some of the persons who have sworn that he instigated them to commit the crime. The learned judge, in charging the jury, said that he never knew or heard of a charge supported by witnesses of so bad a charaoter. THE HARVEST.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe harvest reports continue fa- vourable, although some amount of injury has been inflicted on the grain crops by the late heavy rains. All parties are now agreed in considering the potatoes as almost qnite safe. FLAX IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAt the last meet- ing of the Royal Flax Improvement Society of Ireland the secretary reported that, on waiting upon the Chan- cellor of the Exchequer, accompanied by Mr. Tennent, M.P., to ascertain if he would bring before the house in the present session of parliament, the extension of the Land Improvement Act, referring to scutch-mills, &c., solicited by the society, the deputation was iju. ormed that he had decided against the request. -3 APPROACHING MARRIAGES IX HIGH LiFE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe understand that the preliminaries are arranged for the marriage of the Hon.

THE MILITARY RIOT IX EDINBURGH.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdPatrick Lawless, Thomas Dermody, George Anderson, Alex- ander M'Intyre, Thomas Tligginson, Charles Morgan, and. Martin Maloney, seven privates belonging to the 33rd Regiment, now in the Castle, were brought up on Monday and tried summarily before Mr. Sheriff Gor- don, charzed with assault, as also breach of the peace, on the 24th of June. Mr. Lothian, procurator-fiscal, prosecuted and Messrs. Craufurd aud Gifford acted as counsel for the prisoners. It was proved that on Tuesday evening', the 24th of June, one of a party of three soldiers in going up the High-street broke a pane of glass in a shop window with his sti3k that a police- man who went forward to challenge him for his con- duct was knocked down that another policeman who interfered shared the same fate that the picquet who came down from the Castle at tb^ instead of as- 81st.!Ilg tue police in the execution of their duty, com- mitted a violent assault upon them; that one of the soldiers threatened to run through a constable with a bayonet; that the soldiers generally useu their side- belts against the police, threw stones, and otherwise severely attacked them, until they were overpowered, and several taken into custody, amongst whom were the prisoners. The prisoner Dermody was proved to have drawn his bayonet, and the prisoners Lawless and Anderson were proved to have been particularly active in the use of their side-belts against the police. In exculpation it was stated that Callaghan, the man who broke the window, was given in charge to a cor- poral and two soldiers on the night in question, be- cause he was drunk; that the corporal told the police, on Callaghan being seized, that he would pay for the window, and that Calhglwn was under his charge that the police laid on with thpir batons before they were struck that they began the row that some of the soldiers who were struck did nothing that no stones were thrown, nor side-belts used. On Tuesday the Sheriff pronounced sentence of imprisonment for sixty days on Lawless, Dermody, and Anderson and imprisonment for thirty days on M'Intyre, Higginson, and Maloney.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdScotsman. FATHER GAVAZZI'S LAST ORATION AT AA'ILLIS'S ROOMS ON AVEDNESDAY LAST.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThere was an un- usual throng to hear the parting address of the gifted Italian, previous to his departure for the cities of the north of England and Scotland, which, in compliance with pressing requisitions, he is about to visit during the recess. He began by adverting to the Peace Con- gress, in whose proceedings, to which he had been bidden, he willingly recognised a development of the grand prinri; le, that, public opinion, freely elicited, should regulate the business of mankind. His com- plaint was that the the spoliated, and the victimised members of the human family were in those gatherings unrepresented. France, Prussia, the Ame- rican Union, had their delegates propounding smooth plausibilities; but plundered Mexico, devastated Algiers, trampled Hungary, hand-cuffed Ilesse-Cas- sel, bastinadoed Lombardy, violated Venice, tor- tured Sicily, gagged, manacled, and terror-stricken Rome, had entered no appearance at this pacific con- clave. The expense of a standing army, and its pressure on the pocket, appeared to be the feel- uppermost. Look at Switzerland !\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat mountain- home of freedom never encroached on its neighbour's nationality, nor will it suffer any infringement on its own. Roused from its peaceful industry as by an Aus- tropapal aggression, it started up 80,000 strong, and ejected the foreign element of discord, in defiance of the three great European powers, vigorously, man- fully, and unmistakeably. The result is peace, glory, self-respect, and repose. The Helvetic confederacy had no standing army; but in that unsopliicticated land every freeman carries a fire-lock, in virtue of which he continues free. Talk not to me of a truce with tyranny! I cannot prize the peace of the sepulchre or the ac- quiescence of the bondsman. Let the sleek and pam- pered heirarchy that participates in the proceeds of oppression, preach up a perpetuity of power to plunder and enslave; but, with the blessed Baptist, be it mine to confront the Herods of the hour, and aloud proclaim it unlawful to thee to take what is not thin e own but belongeth unto another.\" To wink at wickedness because worked out 011 a gigantic scale, v to distinguish a national from an individual wrong, is a casuistry I scorn. Be this outstretched arm withered and this tongue cleave paralysed to my palate, if ever through the life-long career that re- mains to me I pause or faulter in my allotted task- the advocacy of Italian right, the enforcement of her just demand, the recoverv of her swindled franchise, the rescue uf ner territory, and the full re- cognition of her independence (cheers), A testimony unsullied and unsolicited, has been just borne on our behalf; a calm dispasstonate voice has been beard in your land, and summoned our slanderers to judgment. If Mr. Gladstone has spoken, if the hoary hypocrites who would defame and stigmatise the virtue that re- sists their foul embrace, and loathes their effort at violation, stand abashed and confounded at the bar of opinion, thanks and blessing on this manly Englishman's interposition. While \"Young England\" in the person of a Baillie Cochrane, would act the pander to each dishonourable attempt, the indignant integrity of a British senate has levelled the blow of a Saxon cudgel on the plotters of our ruin. He anticipated for England another parlia- mentary session wasted like that which is near its close in hurling back on Rome further impertinence and ar- rogant assumptions; and, addressing his couutrymen, who were present in great force, touched upon a variety of national subjects, which he developed with calm judgment and effect, concluding amid cordial cheers. HINTS TO HATTERS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdHats are a great a nuisance; no man out of Bedlam disputes that. They are an absurd roofiing for the capital of the human column- the noblest member of the human body. In the past history of English costume, we can find no cover for men's heads so egregiously ridiculous as that which posterity will see to have been worn by the heroes of '51. In a crowd they are in the way of those behind us if we keep them on, and they probably get smashed if we take them off; we have to hold them gingerly, manoeuvre them, have two thoughts for the hat, and one thought for ourselves. They are a source of head- aches, and in windy weather they call our attention from all other thoughts, because our minds must then be concentrated on the hat. Wo must press it over our brows tightly enough to cause a deep red ring upon the forehead all that done, we must be on the alert for any puff of wind which may require us to carry up our hands for its preservation because the great surface of a column slenderly supported at its base, renders it very liable indeed to be blown over. The abandonment of Lats, without injury g- hatters, is a change now gradually taking place. You shake your head. Well, we will put by that sugges- tion for a few minutes, and consider what sort of sub- stitute for chimney pot hats we, in this country, may be expected reasonably to desire. The Greek cap is often pointed to as something picturesque. In as far as its shape accords with the wearer's head, and does not carioature the outline of the wearer's body, it is very well. It suits the costume and climate of the Greeks, but, I diffidently submit, not the English dress and drizzle. A cap of many colours would not match our sober broad-cloth dress, and a sober skull-cap, without any brim, would pour the rain that fell on it over our faces in wet weather. In England, certainly, the brim is an essential portion of a hat: we want eaves to the roofing of our heads not monstrous um- brella brims, like those of the hats seen in the Tunis department of our Exhibition, but a modera'e projec- tion. The Greeks would have put brims to their caps if they had lived under an English sky. Up the White Nile, the Keks are a race of people wearing skull-caps. They coat their hair with the Nile mud, letting it dry in the sun, so that they seem to go about entirely bald, with earthen skull-caps. If they lived in a rainy country, it would not need many showers to inform them that a mud-pie was unpleasant wearing. Every man to his taste but neither mud caps, nor Greek caps, would suit London weather. A sim- ple head-covering, a skull-cap with a brim, would an- swer the exigencies of our case in the simplest manner. Such a head-covering was introduced, not many years ago, under the name of \"wide-awake,\" by hatters. It was made of felt, and was meant for garden wear. Such bats have been long worn by our rustic popula- lation. Who would have supposed that hatters them- selves, introducing \"wide-awakes,\" began uncon- sciously to work the hat reform ? \u00c2\u00bb Our English ladies, without calling meetings, or creating any stir, have done what English gentlemen have talked about, have for their own parts done away with hats for their own equestrian wear. Ladies who ride with cylinders upon their hsads are now no longer to be seen. They wear the wide-awake;\" they are eman- cipated they appear in reasonable hats, and never will be seen in cylinders again. Omitting feathers, and such decorations as become the English woman, but do not become the man, hats of this form can be adapted to our male costume, and by this change of fashion there accrues no injury to hatters. The change will not be made by public meetings, or by the Anti- Hat Association. It is a change in progress, slowly, but surely, following the current of opinion. The time has arrived when any hattw may perceive tne point to which the publio tas'o is tending. The the Tial reform is in tbe hands of the hatters j if they will leave off making cylinders, and offer to the public hats resembling those now worn by Indies-inoditications of the wid'l-awake-tbey will be well baoked by the pub- lio.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdfjickcrii Household Words.\"", "word": "2", "description": "\u2026, Prussia, the Ame- rican Union, had their delegates propounding smooth plausibilities; but plundered Mexico, devastated Algiers, trampled Hungary, hand-cuffed Ilesse-Cas- sel, bastinadoed Lombardy, violated Venice, tor- tured Sicily, gagged, manacled, and terror-stricken Rome, had entered no appearance at this pacific con- clave.

The old remnants of the military glories of the empire, the flag unfurled, and borne in hands yet vigorous, though they had done their work, came to offer homage to the President. The sturdy veterans did not raise the cry of 'Vive la Republique,' their shout was Vive la Pl\u00c3\u00a9sident,\" Vive la Prince,' and then reaching the climax, out rushed the cry once so familiar to ;he soldier's ear, whether at a review or on the field of battle, Vive I'Empereur.'

SPAIN. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd All parties at Madrid are preparing for t, the approaching elections. The number of candi- dates for the deputation was never so great as on the present occasion. The moderado party appears to be unanimous and well organised their liberal oppo- nents appear more disposed to destroy one another than to do essential harm to the enemy. Lujan Cor- radi, San Miguel, Olozaga, and Kscosurd, were on Sunday elected candidates by the Progresista electors of the Prado. Upon a scrutiny between Corradi and San Miguel, who had polled most votes, Corradi made a speech and declared that it was useless to elect him as deputy as long as the constitution was a mere farce, the press gagged, and individual security unattainable. General San Miguel was, therefore, elected candidate. The cabinet has decided upon employing four steam frigates, of 500 horse power each, in the packet service between Cuba and the mother country.

Tl-SCA N Y.- The Austrian authorities are becoming more tyrannical daily. At Leghorn on the 15th inst five or six imprudent youths were bastinadoed for having worn yellow and black sashes about their persons in a manner considered disrespectful to (lie imperial Colours, some of them having, moreover trampled the Austrian flag under foot by having yellow and black shoe lllliflgs, Count de Crenville issued a very severe edict in consequence, reminding the people of the continued state ot siege, and threaten- ing all funire transgressors with military punishment.

The return of the Grand Duke was looked for about the 20th of this month, but a good deal of mystery and secrecy is observed with respect to the prepara- tions, and his arrival will be very likely private. His intentions as to the future form of the government are so anxiously waited for by some hot-headed pole- ticiaris, that they have resolved to bring the question to a crisis by refusing to pay the new taxes, as not having been imposed according to the regulations of the costitution, which is still supposed to exist, never having been destroyed BELGIUM. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd On Thursday se'nnight, the Royal yacht reached Osteud, where her Majesty and family were welcomed by the KUlg of the Belgians, who had arrived from Brusels the evening before.

The population of the American town, a most gregarious set of deserters, gamesters, and run- aways from justice, took it into their heads one even- ing to organise themselves as a distinct and indepen- dent community. They drew up a string of resolu- tions expressive of their firm resolve to obey thence- forward no other magistrate than a fellow called Tay- lor, a notorious drunkard and gamester, whom they appointed provisional president. Taylor entered upon his functions by opening a warm fire from rifles and revolvers on the inhabitants of the old town. The lat- ter assembled in considerable numbers and repelled the assailants. A gun was discovered by them among the ruins of the fort, and pointed on the American town, which it completely commanded. The United States Consul interfered, but only received kicks and cuff's from his countrymen for his pains. It was only when they saw themselves on the eve of being driven into the sea that the Americans would listen to reason.

Nine hundred thollS In:1 signatuirs, in round numbeis, have been counted at the foot of the petitions for revision, of \"hleh sixty thousand are ciosses, symbols of the unlettered wish.

Cardinal Fornari has been named Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of Studies, in the place of Car- dinal Yizzu'delli, deceased. Ever since the unexpected revelation of Cardinal Antonelii's plans for ousting tile French army from the dominions of his Holiness, a spirit of covert ill feeling has been manifestly increasing between the French and Papal governments, resulting in acts, on the part of General Gemeau, which cannot hut pain- fully impress upon the minds of the ecclesiastics the helpless nature of their present condition. With a view to carrying out the instructions he has recently received from Paris, the General has signified to the Roman Minister of War, Prince Orsini, his intention of occupying several positions in the city which are at present in possession of the Roman troops, such as the gendarmerie barracks at the Porta del Popolo, and the dragoon barracks, which are the Roiiinn bcacf- quarters, at the Piazza della Pilotta. It is also af- firmed that the General has applied for the whole of in, the extensive convent of Santi Apostoli, adjoining the Co!onna Palace, the residence of the French am- bassador. The fortress of Civita Castellana is now required t\" be given up to the sole occupation of the French troops, and will form their first strong position against the Au .nians 011 the road to La Marca and the Le- gations. NAPLES.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe whole population of Naples is in a state of alarm, owing to the innumerable arrests which are again taking place in every class of society. Se- veral gentlemen have been marched through the streets halldcuffed and tied together by a cord, be- tween files of soldiers.

SOUTH AMERICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe arrival of the Royal Mail steam vessel Avon has put us in possession of in- telligence from the various ports of the Pacific. The dates fiom Valparaiso are to the 26th April. We learn that an insurrection had broken out in the Chilian capital, but which had been suppressed after some bloodshed, and tranquillity appears to have been restored by the active measuies adopted on the part of the President of the Re- public. This mail brings details of the earthquake at Val- paraiso, news of w hich first reached England via New York. The 'Valparaiso Mercantile Reporter'gives the following account of this terrible calamity, in which 200 houses weie destroved \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Oil the 3nd of April, at 61 a m., Valparaiso was visited by one of those calamines so frequent in vol- callic countries The severest shcck ever felt since j the great earthquake of the year 1822, when Val- paraiso was almost totally destroyed, has created a panic not equalled by any former event- A severe trembling of the earth, of 15 seconds' duration, pro- longed by less violent after shocks to two minutes, i whichtwominutes appeared as so many hours to those whose I iyes and properties were endangered, has in so short a time destroyed several hundred dwel- lings, and has made a great number of persons house- less. C'onstitucion, we have ascertained, has not suffered. We have received further accounts from a vessd from the south, who reportstohavefetta. severe commotion in the sea, 40 miles off San An- tonio. This confirms us in our opinion that ihe mo- tion of the earthquake has been very irregular. The temperature during the. earthquake was hot and op- pressive, but no alteration took place in the thermo- rnetEr, whicl] stood at 62. The American frigite Raritun let go her lead immediately, and had great difficulty in hauling it in the convulsion at the bot- tom of the sea having caused it to sink three feet in the salld. During the eventful 15 seconds the hor ses rocked to and fro as so many vessels at sea.\" The Custom house buildings have suffered com- paiatively little, some slightly constructed outward ornaments have been demolished, and part of the roof carried along with them, the subsequent heavy raill however 011 the 4th inst, is supposed to have damaged a number of packages of goods, the extent of which has not however, yet been ascertained. A few houses situated on the hill known as the Main Top, a sadors resort, came tumbling dowlI with a crash. Along the beach, however, and the Almen- dral the damage caused has been considerable, the ground being less firm; upwards of two hundred houses are rendered uninhabitable and nearly as many families have bell consequently reduced to the ne- cessity of bivouacking, some in the streets, others in the door ways of their .tuinous dwellings. The prill- cipal public buildings which have suffered are the Custom-house, the Merced and Matnz Churches, the cuarlel of the national guard, the lIospital, and the church of St. Domingo- The scarcity of houses so much felt before the earthquake by the fast in- creasing population of our city, has now reached its climax. Commissioneis have been appointed to ex- amine the eddices and to condemn those which are m a dangerous condition. The town of Casa Blatica, situated about thirty miles from this on the Santiago road also suffered severely and a great number of houses were thrown down by the violence of the shock. The damage done in Santiago is similar to that in alparaiso, with the exception that as there are a greater number of public buildings In the capi- tal the pecuniary loss must be more severe. The principal public buildings more or less damaged are die Mint, a handsome building in ptrt occupied as the residence of the President, the Cathedral, the churches the San Francisco, of the Compania, the oid palace completely ruined, and a portion of the buildings occupied as Government offices. The village of Renca, situated in the subuibs of Santiago, has been partially destroyed and a singular pheno- menon was observed about three leagues from that city, where the ground opened in several places and considerable quantities of hot water were thrown up.'", "word": "2", "description": "\u2026 r.

AUSTRIA\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe old conservative party in Hun- gary, whose influence at court increases da Iy, are very anxious that Dr Bach, the minister of the in- terior, should be dismissed. It was reporied that Deak will be admitted into the ministry as the re- presentative ot Hungary in the cabinet, but without a portfolio; a position similar to that of Baron Kulmer, who represents Croatia Deak is a mall of gleat natural talents, and good business habits before the revolution he belonged to the opposition, but finding it impossible to agree with Kossuth and his party, he withdrew from politics altogether to the out-break, and is one of the few Magyars who did not com- promise themselves in the recent stuggle. His inactivity during the last eighteen months has roused the suspicions of the liberal party against him, and it is even asserted that he has been gained over by the court party. Olmuiz, the second fo tress in Austria in point of strength and importance, is to receive considerable alterations and new fortifications. Cracow, too, which is generally acknowledged to be a place of the highest importance, is to be fortified on a most exten- sive c.le. It is said that a treaty has been concluded between Austria and Kussia for garrisoning Cracow on the completion of the proposed fortification wilh a mixed garrison of Auslnan and Russian 'roops,just as Mayance is now occupied by Austrians and Prus- sians. The police have forbidden the publication of the (, Glornate del Trentlllo,\" and have seized the whole first impress on without assigning any cause All strangers have suddenly been ordered to quit Arad, and none will be permitted to remain therein future without a passport. Several Greek non-union priests have been arrested by the military for attempt- ing to hold a synod of the priests of this confession without the permission of the authorities The ministry had resolved on rewarding Ilaynau, Windischgiji.z, and Jellacliicli, for their services ir. suppressin. the Hungarian revolution, with a grant of several confiscated estates in Hungary. The an- nouncement of this determination produced so violent an opposition from the majority of the Hungarian nobles, that the ministry have been unwillingly com- pelled to change the nature of their reward. Each of the three generals has received, instead of the estate 400,000 florins in state obligations. HOME.- The King of Naples was expected in the, course of the week, and preparations for the girandole were going at the Castle of St. Angelo Some disturbances had been apprehended on the 30th April, the anniveisary of the French defeat before the wails of Rome, but the strictness of the police, and numerous arrests, had prevented anything of the kind from takmg place. The Roman correspondent of the Daily News,' in a lett-r dated May 2nd, says, one of the most in- teresting occurrences of last we?k, was the interview of the Rev. Dr. Townsend, canon of Durham, with the Pope. I mentioned in a previous letter that the rev doctor's object was to endeavour to induce his holiness to do away with the bickerings, animosities, and polemical discords which keep the various denomi- nations of Christians separale,and a: enm:ty, and, by Calling a general council to establish the basis of an universal creed. It was certainly a bold attempt for a protestant clergymen to convert the Pope himself, but the doctor was resolved to beard the lion in his den, and on Friday last he went to the encounter in full dress canonicals. After having knelt to kiss the Pope's hand, Dr. Townsend was invited by his Holi- ness to take a chair, and an animated conversation commenced in Lduu, a fit language for controversy, and one in which the disputants might be presumed to he a match for each other. The Pope was upon the whole very tolerant, as may be imagined from his having not only listened with calmness to Dr. Town- send's argument in favour of releasing the catholic clergy from their vow of celibacy, but also assured him that he entertained serious ideas of adopting such a plan in the early part of his reign, especially after having received pressing letters upon the subject from Germany, but that, in the present state of Italy, and indeed of the whole continent, any innovation on his part would be dangerous, even if he had the power to act freely, which he had not, being by no means the free agent that he was on his first accession to the throne. The same objection would prevent him from calling a general council, or attempting to unite the great and divided family of Christians, although he fully admitted the grandeur of the scheme, protested his own desire for peace and harmony, and wept at Dr. Townsend's enthusiastic picture of England re- cognising in Pio Nono the head of an universal church. After three quarters of an hour's discussion, the rev. canon took his leave, placing in the hands of his holiness a document contammg the principal heads of his argument, which appears to have made some impression on the pontiff s mind, judging from the fact of his having sent to the doctor's residence on Sunday last, only two days after the interview, re- questing to be made acquainted with the period of Dr. Townsend's return (he has just gone to Naples,) as he should then like to have some more conversa- tion with him NAPLES \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn the 211d inst., the French squadron was still anchored in the bay, as was that of Ame- rica, which was to leave in a few days. The church continue? to play a \\ery active part in the sup- pression of public opinion. Letters from Sicily to April 28th, state that arrests continued throughout the island. Thesamesysemofterror was observed there as at Naples, for the purpose of stifling political opinion.

Dear Sir,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdI beg leave to enclose you a letter from Major Dzwouk- owski, who has sailed from this with 105 of his Po- lish countrymen for Southampton on their way to Belgium.

The name of the vessel is the Felice, of Alalta. I ha\\e given him a letter for you.

MORE O'FF.RRALL. To R. Andrews, Esq GREECE-Accounts from Athens, of the 27th tilt., announce that Baron Gros had ceased his negotiations on the 24th, and that at four o'clock on the evening of the 25th the Piraeus was again submitted to a war blockade by Sir William Parker. At the same time orders were given for the blockade of all the other ports of Greece. On the 25th the Greek Chamber met with closed doors, when the Greek Minister explained that the renewal of hostilities was in con. sequence of the definitive rufusal of the Greek Government to admit in principle the claims of the English Cabinet, although the amount of the claims was nearly settled. In answer to a question as to the support to be expected from the two other pro tecting powers, the Minister of Foreign Affairs replied that he expected none, notwithstanding his pressing solicitations to that effect. A very stormy debate in ho'h houses ensued on a demand from the Ministry of <i bill of -ndetwnity; both houses refused the in- demnity, left all the responsibilty to the Ministers, and passed a formal resolution that the Government should act according to the interests of the country, and having in consideration the perils which menaced it. The Greek Government then opened fresh nego- tiations wnh Mr. Wyse, who gave in an ultimatum, which was accepted by the Government, and the Greek quarrel was finally put an end to on the 27th. The Minister of the Interior has issued a formal notice to that effect, and letters from Malta of the 2nd inst. sta e, that orders were given to lay down the buoys in the Great Harbour, in anticipation of the imme- diate return of the English squadron.

An army amour ting to 30,000 men is gradually collecting at Paderborn, and small bodies of troops are being posted at places from which they can easily support the former, if it should be necessary. A frightful tragedy has just been enacted on the Prusso-Polish borders. On the 1st inst., 10 Tsclier- kessen delivered themselves up to the district com- Wissary in Krussmtz, slating that they had deserted from the Russian garrison at Lowicz because they were not permitted to return to their ow n country after having voluntarily served in the recent campaign it, Hungary. They were all well-armed and mounted, and the district commissary, not knowing what to do with them, forwarded them to his superior officer, the landrath in Inowraclaw, together with a written re- clamation of the tugitives from the commander of the Caucasian troop in Lowicz. The landrath inquired of them what they wanted, and why they fled ? The unhappy men all declared that they wished to take service in Prussia, being disgusted with the brutal III-treatment they had met with from the Russian officers. They requested to be allowed to proceed to Bedin, but Fernow, the landrath, replied to them that that was impossible, and that they must deliver tip their arms and allow themselves to be reconveyed across the frontier, in obedience to the treaty between Russia and Prussia, which requires the immediate delivery to either of every deserter. They were then conducted to barracks, which they refused to enter, saying they could accept none but free quarters. They then declared themselves willing to return into Poland, but refused to give up their arms on any account. Tile civil authoritws then called in the aid of the military, and 30 dragoons were ordered up to take their arms by force. Seeing the dragoons ap- 11 proaching, the Tscherkessen spurred their horses round and fled, pursued by the dragoons. During this flight several shots were fired by both parties. A corpcral of dragoons was shot dead, and several Others wounded. Twe wounded and one unwounded Tscherkessen were also taken prisoners,and the bodies of two dead were brought into Inowraclaw in the afternoon. The remainder fled into two houses on the road side, about 2.000 yards from Mowrachw. Here they barricaded themselves in, and were formally surrounded. One house was set on fire, but the daring mell fled into the other. Infantry were then ordered up from another neighbouring village. Forty Inen arrived and opened a fire on the second house with rockets. It soon caught. Four of its courage- ous tenants rushed out of the door, firing their rifles, but were received with a shower of balls, which put an end to one, and wounded the other three the fifth Was burned to death in the house. An infantry pr:. vate fell a victim to their rifles during the time they occupied the second house. In this incredible affair three Tscherkessen were killed, and five dangerously Wounded; three of the latter cannot survive their wounds, so that only four will be delivered up to Russia. Two of the soldiers were killed, and four bounded. HESSE CASSEL.-G,meral Ilaynau, the newly ap- pointed Commander-in-chief at Cassel, has just is- sued the following announcement:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd After living for three years in the retirement of pri- vate life, and quietly observing from that position Since March, 1848, so many proceedings painful to the feelings of a true Hessian, I am quite unexpect- edly called by his Highness the Elector to the posi- tion of commander-in-chief in our fatherland during the continuance of the state of siege, and am endowed with extensive power to break the opposition to the royal ordinances of the sovereign which have been tendered necessary by the undutiful conduct of the Assembly in denying those means without which the administration of his government cannot be carried on, as well as by the usurpation and presumption of the Standing Committee\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand to restore the reign of law and order in the state. That I, an old man of 71 years, willingly obey the call of my sovereign to exchange the chosen quiet of my retired life for the tod and anxiety of an office which alike by the de- luded and the deluders is despised, may prove to e\"ery man not only that I am fully convinced of the legality and constitutional character of the measures of the government, but that 1 will respond to the con- fidence placed in me without fear of man, and with energy and zeal. Let those who are inclined to offer an active or passive opposition to the lawful authority learn Ihat although I am hoary with age, I am firmly confident, in the aid of Almighty God, I shall exer- cise the office entrusted to me with strict severity, and prove to all that I still know how to wield the sword of authority with decision and force. Lieut -Gen. VON IIAYNAU. Cassel, Oct. 1, 1850. Haynau inspected the troops on the 4th inst., and baranjjued them on the absolute power of the prince. The Burger guard was dissolved the same day while on parade, but refused to surrender arms. All the journals are suspended. The formal capitulation has taken place between General Haynau and the officers at Cassel, who, with the exception of four, unanimously regard their con- stitutional oath as binding. Upon the declaration of the officers that they could not reconcile his com- mands with the plain dictates of their duty, and that they had on that account sen.t a representative to Wdhetmshad, the general engaged that until the re- turn of that messenger he would not proceed in the execution of the exceptional measures. M Wilkens, judge-advocate of the garrison at Cassel, on receiving a notification of his appointment as a member of the new court martial, immediately addressed a letter to Haynau, declaring that he considered himself as bound by his oath of office to regard the laws as his inflexible rule, and that he could not reconcile the ap- pointment of the extraordinary court with any of the existing statutes, nor acknowledge the power of the Prince to dispense with the concurrent sanction of the Permanent Parliamentary Committee in making new laws.

TIIE Cill'r: or Coon IIOPE,-Oll Friday last t! e Prince of If*u!cs, Indiaman, landed her mails at Portsmouth. She brings news iioin the Cape to the 8iii of April, bit none of importance. Mailers were in a stale of great, uncertainly. The governor of St. Helena had gone in II.M.S. Sampson with troops to the Cape. Sir Harry Smith had jssued an order for a further levy of burghers, to be raised at a co,t of 2,0)01. Her Majesty's steamers Dee and Hermes weie still ply ng, taking troops and levies to the mouth of the Buffalo. Lady Smith was about te follow Sir Harry to Graiiam's Town. By a later arrival, the Tcviot, we learn that the screw mill steamer Sir Robert Peel, from the Cap, arrived at S' Vincent on the 2G:h ult., and i .it the same dav fur Plymouth; she had news on boa d from the Cape up to the 2nd ult. It arprars that s! e left the Cape two or three days before her time, v\\idi important and urgent despatches for the government. Those on board the Sti, Fccl refused to give any journals or mention the news they had from the Cape to parties on board the Te- viot, which was then Ivimr in St. Vincent harbour, although there was every probability that the Tevi d would reach Fngland first. The Sir Robert Peel did not stop to coal at St. Vincenl, her commander being anxious to reach Plymouth befoie the Tevint reached Southampton. When the screw mail steamer left St. Vincent, she had a tremendous head wind to encounter, arid it was hardly possible for her to make headway. It was expected that she could rot reach Plymouth for two days or longer after the Tevint ar- rived at Southampton. During the siay of the Sir Robert Pui and Tcviot at St. Vincent, persons on bo,nd the latter obtained, by much difficulty and the observance of much secresy, that the news t'ioiii the Cape was of gieat importance\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat Sir Harry Smith was just holding his own. lie could not ad- vance, and ivas merely senoing out scouring parties. He was anxiously waiting re-inforcements from Eng- land. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer, Singapore, with 300 troops, had arrived at the Cape, but her Majesty's steamer Vulcan had not arrived when the Sir Robert Peel left. A Kaffir chief, on whose alliance the governor relied, had gone over to the enemy. The boers were taking the field. In an engagement with the enemy 125 of the British troops, men and officers, had been slain. UNITED STATES.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe American mail steamer Arctic, Captain Luce, arrived at Liverpool on Sun- dav last with 160 passengers, 425,000 dollars in spe- cie orl freight, and the [sual mail. She met the Baltic when within three hours' sail of New York. The political news by this arrival is not important. The President, and a portion of his cabinet, have been engaged during the week in completing their totir of the State of New York, and have been re- cpived with enthusiasm. Twenty-five men arrested in Florida s Cuba con- spirators had arived at Baltimore, and during the previous month 1.500 suspicious men had been on the coast, but had dispersed. Letters from Ohio of the 18th April state that Bra- zil had declared the slave-trade piracy, but give no details. The bridge on the Louisville and Frankfort Rail- road, a short distance west of the latter place, gave way --is a train was passing over it, and fell with the cars a distance of twenty feet. Six dead bodies, shockingly mangled, were recoved from the ruins at the last accounts. The los of life is thought to be very great. Accounts had been recei red from New Orleans of the explosion of the steamer Echo, at Bayou Sara, by which several persons were killed, and wounded. The efftctof tbe explosion was terrific.

SUICIDE OF THE COMMANDER OF THE RIFLEMAN. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt is with unfeigned regret that we announce the death of Lieutenant Branch, late commander of the Rifleman, 4, screw-schooner at Brazils, and son of the most gallant and distinguished officer, the late Captain A. B. Branch, X.H., who died some time since of cholera, in Green. wich Hospital. The Rifleman was ordered to sea from Rio, and was proceeding at the rate of about eight knots, when the commander, who had been confined to his cabin from illness, in a fit of delirium rushed out, knocked down a corporal of marines who attempted to stop him, and jumped over the side of the vessel. The .Rifleman was immediately hove to, boats were lowered, but all in vain. Lieutenant R. H. Dalton, second lieu- tenant of the Rifleman, was aDDointed bv the Admiral to the vacancy. PAUPEK SCHOOLS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMr. Jelinger Symons has just published a report on the parochial union schools of Gloucester, Salop, Worcester, Hereford, Monmouth, and the principality of Wales. As one of her Majesty's inspectors of schools, Mr. Symons has had abundant opportunities of watching the effect of education on the children of the poor and he has arrived at the very rational conclusion, that high-flown education, which ill-supplies the moral or temporal necessities of the poor,\" is to be deprecated and he shows, in the most convincing manner, -1 the close connection between industry and morailty.\" His conclusions are thus recapitulated :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdI. That industrial training, according to the spirit of the Poor-law orders, and that kind of practical mind teaching and moral culture indispensable for the uplifting of pauper children into the ranks of independent industry, have no existence in three-fourths of the unions in my districts.-2. That this can never be attained whilst the children remain in the work- houses, without such inconvenience and expense as make it hopeless.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd3. That the domiciliation of pauper children in a workhouse, the contaminating intercourse, the comparative comforts, and the habitual bodily idleness in which three-fourths of the whole number live, must tend powerfully to a recurrence of pauperism, or to criminal means of future livelihood.-4. That the manifest remedy for these grave evils, is the establish- ment of district industrial schools, rendered partly self- supporting by spade husbandry, so that pauper children may be wholly withdrawn from workhouses--That the present extra expense of such establishments would be insignificant, and its future results a certain saving and that no objection to this course has been yet made which affords any justification of delaying its adoption.

Through- out Christendom, whatever advance has been made in knowledge, in freedom, in wealth, and in the arts of life, has been made in spite of her, and has everywhere been in inverse proportion to her power. I he loveliest and most fertile provinces of Europe have, under her rule, been sunk in poverty, in political servitude, and in in- tellectual torpor; while Protestant countries, once pro. verbial for sterility and barbarism, have beetl turned by skilland industry into gardens, and can boast of a long list of heroes and statesmen, philosophers and poets. Whoever, knowing what Italy and Scotland naturally .are, and what, four hundred years ag, they actually were, shall now compare the country round Rome with the country round Edinburgh, will be ahle to form some judgment as to the tendency of the Papal domination. The desci-nt of Spain, once the first among monarchies, to \u00c2\u00abhe lowest depths of degradation; the elevation of Holland, in spire of many natural disadvantages, to a posiuoii such as no commonwealth so small has ever reachf-d, teach the same lesson. Whoever passes, in \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2Germany, from a Roman Catholic to a Protestant principality in Switzerland, from a Roman Catholic to a Protestant canton in Ireland, from a Roman Catholic to a Protestant county finds that he has passed from a lower to a higher grade of civilization.

Did not complain of the outrage to any- one, as she was afraid of being sent back to the union. She left prisoner's service, he being too poor to keep her, and went into the service of Mrs. Pridgell at the Globe, who, finding her unwell last week, discovered she was infected with a loathsome disease, but which had only made its appearance upon her en the previous Saturday week.

I ORTUGAL.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA revolutionary movement is reported to have broken out in Portugal, headed by the Marquis Saldanha. Troops had been sent out 10 suppress it, and it Was believed that it would not be serious, although the Queen had deemed it advisable to send a special request that the British fleet should not remove from the Tagus. The ^'jTwes says, the sudden outbreak of a military insur- rection in Portugal, though not entirely unforeseen by those who, like ourselves, mistrusted the policy of Count Thomar'g Government, has, nevertheless, occurred sooner than had been expected, & under different circumstances \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The Duke of Saldanha, whose decided opposition to any insurrectionary movement was long regarded as the chief guarantee of the peace of the kingdom, has now placed bead of the armed opposition, and has suc- ceeded ia detaching a considerable portion of the army from its allegiance to the Queen's government. For some time past SiWa Cabral, who has remained since 1848 on terms of deadly hostility to Costa Cabral. the Count de Anomar, his brother, has been engaged in connecting to- er by-political ties the leaders of the Septembrist party, and of the Lartista opposition\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdSaldanha, Lavradio, and Atagalhaep, ,\u00c2\u00abrho carry with them the great bulk of the itovah-t party. The confidential agents of these ehief. and lactions have been fur some time pa.t in constant communi- cation with Silva Cabral, and the movement which has Ju-t taken place would seem to prove that a very powerful pollUcalllIld military combination has now been brought to maturity against the Couit and the Prime Minister. The troops at Mafra, Cintra, anut-eira had evidently been tarn. pei eri with. and joined on the firs-t summoni the standard of the Opposition under 8uchachiefas Saldanha,. whose name gives at once dignity and moderation to the movement. The fidelity of the garrison of Lisbon, which did not exceed 4,000 men, was doubtful, andjthe detachment of the Queen'a forces sent to occupy Saniarem was not expected to reach that important position before it had fallen into the pos- sesion of the enemy. Hitherto no appeal seems to have been made to popular sympathy, and we remain in the dark as to the avowed pretexts of the insurrection but we must suppose that it would not have been joined in the first instance by men of \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00b0 much weight and character if its objects had been subversive of the just rights ot the crown.' UNITED STATES.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe ship Arctic arrived at Liverpool on Monday, from New York, with Don Manuel Escando and the Hon. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Goodrich, Peter Parley,\" the former on a financial mission from Mexico to London, on board. Generals Scott and Cass had been nominated for the Presidency. Jenny Lind had arrived at Nashville, and was expected at New York, en route to London in May. Large numbers of passengers to the Crystal Palace were about to leave New York; few berths were vacant in the steam-ship Canada, from Boston, on the 9th, and the Baltic, from New York, on the 16th instant. It is stated that several leaders of the Irish Directory, in New York, were among the intended voyagers. The Chronicle correspondent, writing on politics, says:- A strong feeling was beginning to set in against the obnoxious Fugitive Slave Bill. The State of Ohio had ini- tiated the movement, and by a large majority its legislature had passed resolutions calling for a repeal or modification of the law. That portion of it which excluded suspected fugitive slaves from the privilege or right of being dealt with by juries was especially condemned. Massachusetts Was about to follow in the wake of Ohio, and a State Con- vention, without distinction of party, had been called for Boston on the 8th inst., to pronouuee against the bill.\" We have no fresh news from California, if we except the following tragical tale of Lynch law, at Nevada city, on January 24th, related in the New York Journal of Commerce: \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd \"A drunken Englishman, named Divine, murdered his wife under circumstances of unusual cruelty. During their whole residence in George-town, she had supported him and her children by her own industry. He asked her one morning for money to gamble with, but she told him to wait uutil he was sober. He rushed across, the room for a pistol, but she anticipated him, and threw it into a bucket of water. He then leaped into the street, snatched a rifle from the shoulder of a passer-by, returned and shot her through the heirt. It was Sunday, and, as usual, the places ofrelort were filled by miners, who invariably spend their holiday in town. The report of a rifle in the street was nothing unusual, but the tale of horror flew as only rumour can fly, and in live minutes the house was filled. In such a country as ourj, and under such circumstances as these, men act rather than speak. A neighbouring round tent' (our gambling- bouses are often turned into court-rooms on account of their size) was selected as the scene of trial. The prisoner was led in, and then, before a word was spoken another pariy brought in the body of the wife, just as she fell, with the dark blood oozing from her brenft. She was gently laid on a large table near her huiband. This sight stung the people into freniy. No one thought of wasting words on the trial. The prisoner was seized and hurried towards a little eminence overlooking the village, where a noose of a lariat swung significantly from a tree. Just at this moment a man of great influence with the people in that vicinity attempted to postpone their design uutil a coroner's inquest should be held upon the body, and a sum- mary trial, but still a trial, had, after their verdict. With much difficultv he succeeded, on condition that the inquest and trial should both be held on that day; and, ad the coroner was at Columa, four o'clock was given as the last moment. An express was sent to Columa,; and, to save time, a jury empanelled to act instantly npon his arrival. They sat together in the tent with the prisoner and the body. The mob waited outside, but were not unemployed. A deep pit was dug at the foot of the tree, and all the lolemu furniture of the grave prepared. As four o'clock pproached the silence of the mob was broken by deep uspers and hoarse murmurs. Rides, pistols, and bowie tves were freely displayed. They did not escape the otice of the jury, and they began, not unnaturally, to fear for their own safety. At last, when the sun was low in the west, the mob could wait no longer, but tore up the side of the tent, and rushed in, just in time to see the last juryman escaping by a baokwav They went at their taak without a word. At the head of the procession the murderer marched to his gallows, and the body of his wife was borne close bebiod him. The children, tnank heaven I were not there but even in that etern scene they were not forgotten. A Imall box, marked 'For the Orphans,' was nailed to the tree, and many an ounce was poured into it from the purser of those who followed the father to his death. The bo ty of the murdered woman was lowered into a wide pit, and, even while the wretched man g >zed upon it, and upon that empty but significant by his side, the cord suddenly tightened around his neck. aud be swayed in the air. The mob sat on the hill side and sternly watched him. At the end of half an hour he was cut down, and laid in the grave by the side of his wife. In five minutes Georgetown was as ttill as that lonely grave upon the hill. Not a man was to be seen in the streets; no one knew anything of that lawless mob. In the evening the coroner arrived, and, upon hear- ing the story, summoned his jury for moruiag. They met at sunrise upon the hill, and stood around the unfilled grave. Upon one of the slips was written, Murdered by \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Divine, her husband,' and upon the other, Died accord- ing to the will of God and justice of men Another in- stance occurred to.day in this city. Yesterday morning a Dr. Lennox, from Scotland, was shot while sitting in his otlice. This morning a man, who had often menaced his life, was seized on suspicion, and examined before the proper authorities. During the examination several circumstances were discovered which left scarcely a doubt of his guilt.

HoRitini.K MURDER IN PARIS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdGalgnctni s lvlcssrn- per gives an account of a most horrible and revolting murder which has recently been perpretrateo in Paris. The victim is a M. Desfontaines, a manufacturer of bronzes the Rue St. Honore. It appears that a. short time back he engaged a new man-servant at a register office. The young man had been with his master little more than a fortnight, when one morning he engaged two commissionaires at the cornet of the Rue Royal, to convey three trunks, which he said contained goods, to the Central Railway station, from his master's house. The trunks were accordingly removed from the house by the men, while the ser- vant told the consiegc that his master had left for the\\ railway station, and went away himself. As, how- ever, Mr. Desfontaines had said nothing to his neigh- bours about going upon a journey, their suspicions J were aroused by seeing the shop shut up, and they s communicated with the police. Shortly afterwards t transpired that a mutilated corpse had been found at the railway station at Cliateauroux, in a trunk which had been sent from Paris to an imaginary address, and which, on inquiry, was ascertained to be one of those entrusted to the charge of the com- missionairs by the man-servaut. The other two trunks had been taken by the apparent owner to Bourges. The murderer, it appeared, as the box was too small, had cut the body in pieces, depositing first the trunk, then the legs, and then the arms and head. It is sup, osed that M. Desfontaines had been murdered while he was asleep, as he was a very strong and courageous man, and that the murderer had then possessed himself of everything of value in the shop. Oil the shop being opened, an instrument. for splitting wood, stained with blood, was found, with which it was supposed the skull of the deceased, which was horribly smashed, had been heaten in. A bloody piece of linen, a wash-hand basin contain- ing water stained with blood, and other blood traces were also discovered, but nothing to indicate the cutting up of the body. By the last accounts, it ap- pears that the assassin has been arrested in Paris. TOTAL Loss OF THE \"TORONTO\" PACKET Sin?.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd This magnificent packet ship, nearly 1,000 tons bur- den, which has made some of the most rapid passages on record between London and New York, has been totally lost on the Mantanilla Reef, near the Bahama Islands, in Florida Gulf Stream, at the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico.

The wreck then sunk down on the rocks, and her decks, with the exceution of the quarter deck, were completely under water. The following morning the passengers were got into the boats, and the crew and master followed, with the intention of making for the Bahama Islands. Just, however, as the boats were leaving the wreck' a vessel, which proved to be the Vandalla, was perceived making for the wreck, and in a short time she came up and took the whole of them on board in safety. The Toronto soon after- wards entirely disappeared, and was a total loss. The ship and cargo were valued at \u00c2\u00a330,000.

SIPPI, OHIO, and MISSOURI RIVERS, exhibited, by Special Command, before Her Majesty the Queen, H.R.H. Prince Albert, and the Court and Royal Family at Windsor Castle, and at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, for a year and a half, where it was viewed by over Half a Million Persons. This magnificent Panorama of the Three Largest Rivers in North America pourtrays accurately the River, Forest, and Prairie Scenery of the Great West, passing through nine States of the American Union and twelve degrees of latitude, from the Rocky Mountains and Yel- low Stone Bluffs of the Missouri, and Cincinnati, the Queen City of the West, on the Ohio, to the City of New Orleans, on the Mississippi, near the Gulf of Mexico; being by far the Largest Painting ever executed by man. It shows life on the Great Western Waters; the thriving Cities and Towns; the early Settler's Hut, or Log Cabin; the manner of clearing the land for cultivation Indians Hunting Buffaloes; a Burning Forest; the immense Prairies of Grass; Cypress Swamps; the singular Steam Boats, Flat Boats, Rafts, and other Water Craft of the Mississippi; a Prairie on Fire; Indian Village by Moon- light, &c., all combining to form a most instructive and entertaining Exhibition. The scenery of the magnificent Rivers in question is given with striking fidelity, and we are presented with, not only the features of the country, but with abundant pictures of human life as found on the Great Western Waters.\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBath Chronicle. This Panorama is beautifully executed. No one can pay a visit to this excellent Exhibition without receiving fully as much instruction as amusement. It is a valuable means of conveying a knowledge of distant scenery far more forcibly than by lectures or books.\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBristol Times. The Press, metropolitan as well as provincial, have been unanimous in their com mendations of thisExhibition, and no one who visits it can fail to be impressed with the conviction of its excellence, and that the praise bestowed upon it has been richly deserved. The Panorama is a life-like illustration of a voyage through these Great Rivers of the Western Continent, and we sincerely advise our readers not to omit the opportunity of witnessing it.\" Bath Journal.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. The discussion on M. Ste. Beuve's motion for the adoption of the system of Free Trade by France, came on last week, when M. Thiers made a Ion, speech in opposition to it, urging that the system of Free Trade was not suited to France. M. Fould made, in the absence of the Minister of Commerce, the following declaration on the suhJect:- rue Government re- jected the principle of Free Trade as opposed to the security and independence of a great nation. The protective system should be firmly maintained in the interest of national industry. He did not mean, however, that it should be blind and immutable. The mere taking into consideration of M. Ste. Beuve's proposition would alarm the country. The most vulgar prudence, moreover, demonstrated its inopportunity, and it was for those two reasons the Cabinet requested the Assembly to reject it. On a division being taken, there appeared for taking the proposition into consideration, 199 against it, 428. The President of the Republic left Paris for Poi- tiers on Tuesday morning at half-past six o'clock, ac- companied by the Ministers of War, Foreign Affairs, and the Interior, h^ Aides-de-Camp, and Orderly Officers, and escorted by a troop of cavalry. In the evening a magnificent banquet was given in the grand saloon of the Palais de Justice, formerly the I abode of the Counts of Poitou. The President's health having been given by the Mayor of Poitiers, Louis Napoleon responded in a speech of which the following is the most important passage, as bearing upon the political condition of France :-Like you, I regard the future prospects of the country without apprehension, for its salvation mm.t ever proceed from the will of the people, freely expressed and re- ligiously respected. (Loud applause.) For that reason, I hail with all my heart the solemn moment when the powerful voice of the nation will prevail over all opposition, and reconcile all rivalry for it is painful to see revolutions shaking society, covering the-cotlntry with ruins, and always leaving erect the same passions, the same exigencies, and the same elements of discord.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe speech was received throughout with enthusiastic acclamations, and fol- lowed by cries of Vive Napoleon Vive la President The President returned to Paris at half-past ten in the evening of Wednesday. His I speech at Poitiers was favourably received at the Paris Bourse, where it produced a rise in the price ef Government securities. Eighteen Socialists have just been tried before the Assize Court of Paris, eight of whom were found guilty of having formed a secret society for the over- throw of the existing institutions. They were sen- tenced to various terms of imprisdxnent, from six months to two years, and to fines of from 100 to 200 francs. On Sunday M. Poitevin, accompanied by his wife, made a balloon ascent from the Champ de Mars in a carriage and two horses suspended from his gigantic balloon, the Globe. Two hundred soldiers were sta- tioned round the balloon to hold the cords, and on their releasing their hold the balloon rose majesti- cally amidst the enthusiastic shouts of the specta- tors. The aeronauts descended safely on the same evening near the Pare de Grignon, in the arondisse- ment of Versailles, and on the following morning they proceeded to Pans in the carriage in which they had m'lde their ascent. M. Poiteven was then informed that the authorities had forbidden for the future any balloon ascent with animals of any kind, or any pas- sengers exeept those going for scientific purposes. On hearing this M. Poitevin set off to the hotel of the Minister of the Interior with the very same carriage and horses which he had taken up, to represent to the Minister the disastrous consequences to which such an interdict would subject him, but without success. SPAIN. The vote of confidence in the Cabinet has passed the Chamber of Deputies, by a majority of 184 to 31. The Catalan Deputies have remonstrated with the Government relative to the Concordat, the publica- tion of which will, it is feared, create disturbances in the Catalonian provinces, where the people are deter- mined not to permit the restoration of the abuses of the Romish Church. Reports of an unfavourable nature are in circulation as to the causes by which \\1. Bravo Murillo is forced to press the passing of the Treasury Debt Bill through the Senate, the claims c which it is intended to represent are unliquidated, and from 30,000,000 to 40,000,000 of the items rest on unvouched documents. Names are mentioned in con- nection with the transaction which ought to be above suspicion, ftl. Bravo Murillo's own honour however is not brought into question. ITALY. The accounts from Rome represent the city as being in a state of uneasiness in consequence of an apprehension that disturbances were about to be caused by the Mazzinians. Several parcels of cigars have been discovered in the very magazines of the Government, sealed with the Government seal, and charged with fulminating powder contained in a small tin tuhe. In consequence of this discovery several arrests have been made. Signor Bonifazi, the bookseller has had his premises set on fire, and has received threatening letters menacing him and his family with death. The police have some hopes of discovering the murderer of Signor Evangelisti. MM. Ledru Rollin, Mazz-n: Ruge, and Darasz. have ad- dressed a manifest) .\"Aux population Komaines,\" exhorting them to unite for the overthrow of the Cur and the Emperor of Austria the former of whom is described as a living lie \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2\" the latter as a de- ceiver everywhere, a tyrant gVerywhere.\" At Milan, the provincial physician of the delegates of Milan, Dr. Vandoni, has been stabbed in the open street, in two places, and died in consequence of his wounds. The Chamber of Deputies at Turin has approved the commercial treaty with Switzerland by 110 votes to 4, and the additional convention to the treaty of navigation and commerce with France by a majority of 89 to 31. It is stated that the Piedmontese Government having put up bonds to the amount of 18,000 francs to public competition, received offers for double the amount. The Government 0f Tuscany has given to the Marquis Ferdinand Bartolemmei the option of placing himself under the Sltrveillance of the police at his country house, or leaving Tuscany altogether, for the space of six months, his presence at Florence being considered dangerous to the police. Three young Englishmen, sons of the late Lord Aldborough, and claiming to be his legitimate heirs (though a son of the late'Lord, by a previous mar- riage, enjoys one of the family titles) were arrested on the evening of the 10th, at the villa of their mother, near Leghorn, in the act of destroying incend- diary and treasonable papers, with concealed fire- arms in their possession, a printing press, the third number of a Republican journal and the new- fashioned infernal machine of walking-canes, con- taining a reservoir from which vitriolic acid may be ejected on the dresses of ladies seen with Austrian officers, or wearing Austrian colours. The police discovered papers, which, it is said, show that they were members of the conspiracy, which, under the pretext of regenerating the peninsula, seeks to plant the Red Republic in Italy. A correspondence im- plicatK/g 14 persons, who were at once arrested, was likewise found. Much of the correspondence wasin, English, and coming from London. Had they bjwF Tuscan or Austrian subjects, they would have been tried at the drumhead and shot within an hour. But the interference of Mr Macbeau induced the Com- mander-in-Chief to give them a fair chance of trial before a Court-martial, when they will be allowed the fullest privelege of defence. The trial, however, is to be secret, and nothing will transpire until the sentence of the Court-martial is laid before the Com- mander-in-Chief. The representatives of England intend to apply for a copy of-the act. of accusation, for free communication on the pjr or the prisoners with a legal adviser, and for an open trial, at which the British Consul, or a person delegated by him, may be present. GERMANY. The official organs of the Diet have published a /docur .t, the discovery of which, with the papers accoi ^nying it, is said to have been the cause of the nun ,ous arrests and domicillary visits which have recently taken place in all parts of Germany. It seems that the London Committee, having split into two in September iast, the minority declared itself to be the new central organ of the party, r passed re- solutions, which the other Central Coim. ^ee declare in the circular now issued to he \"illegal.\" Since this rupture London has been divided into two dis- u'.e'q for the purposes of the j rop^ganda, both in con- nection wi.'h the central power, the seat of which has been transferi^j (0 Cologne. The memorial warns all branch Committees to have nothing to do with certain agents of he opposit'on body. From all parts-of Germany reports arrive of judi- cial sentences pronounced against persons charged with participating in the agitations of 1848. This is according to the oidinary period required to bring a criminal process to maturity in Germany. A serious accident has happened to the Duke of Gotha. His Royal Highness while in the bath was looking into a pipe which was stopped, and the at- tendant unaware of this, endeavouring to clear the pipe with a stick lrem the other side, the Duke was struck in the eye by the stick, as it came through UNITED STATES. 0 Mr Corwin, the Secretary of the Treasury, in his report of December last, estimated that, by the 1st of July, there would be in the Treasury a balance of only 458,968 dollars 99 cents, and that by the 1st of July, 1852, there would be a deficiency of 865,996 dollars 19 cents. The New York Herald, attri- buting this estimate to a desire for the increase of the tariff, contends, that instead of there being only a small sum in the Treasury on the 1st of July next, there will be a surplus of probably 7,000,000 dollars, as the receipts to the present time have exceeded his estimates by 6,000,000 dollars and that on the 1st of July, 1852, instead of there being a deficiency, there will probably be a surplus of about 13,000,0o0 dollars. Barnum has acknowledged having made 500,000 dollars by the Jenny Lind concerts the Swedish Nigtingale herself has realised 350,000 dollars in the United States, the net proceeds of the 94 concerts being nearly 1,000,000 dollars. The steam ship North America, which had been announced to sail from New York for Ireland, was withdrawn on the very eve of her departure, in con- sequence of a sudden offer to purchase her. The few passengers who had engaged a passage for the ex- excursion to Galway, were offered tickets for the pacific, for the purpose of placing her on the route from San Francisco to Realejo. 0 A terrible fire has occurred in San Francisco, lay- ing in ashes property to the amount of from 12,000,000 dols. to 16,000,000 dols. Among the buildings destroyed are the Custom-house, s.nd seven hotels. The fire also spread to the shipping, burning a large numbei of vessels lying at the wharves. Every newspaper office in the city except that of the A'ta California was consumed by the flames. The utml s: consternation prevailed during the fire, and thousands were turned out of house and home, having lost their all. It is feared that a number oflives huve been lost. Business was not thought of, and San Francisco presented a heart-sickening picture. A great fire has also occurred at Stoc' t n, the loss of which was estimated at over 1,000,000 dollars. Large numbers of Chinese have latterly been arriving at San Francisco. MEXICO.

{"ocr": "AMONGST the different matters of interest which have occurred since our last, is one, which will be heard by all with regret, or at least with sympathy, for the cause by which the last days of a great man have been hastened. We allude to the DEATH OF LouIS PHILIPPE, ex-king of the French. This illustrious Prince had, as is general known, suffered from nervous debility ever since his abrupt depar- ture from his late seat of government, the sudden shock proving too great for a person of his advanced years. On Friday last, aggravated symp- toms appeared, so much so as to induce him to summon the immediate members of his family, believing that his dissolution was fast approaching, He expired on Monday about half-p<\u00c2\u00bbst eight in the morning. Louis Philippe and his family had been tor some time staying at his Villa adjoining the Star and Garter, at Richmond, where he expired, and not at Claremont, as announced in soia^of the papers. The following sketch from the Time^nl n o doubt, prove acceptable. Louis PHILIPPE, King of the French, was distin guished among all the men who have figured with equal prominence on the stage of history and in the government of mankind, by the absence of those tran- scendant powers of intellect, those inordinate passions, those imposing virtues, or those daring crimes which commonly mark the annals of human greatness. But for those perilous gifts of genius and empower he sub- stituted a singular compound of the minor qualities of human nature. Whether for good or evil, these constituted the large aggregate of his character and in forming a correct judgment of this remarkable man it would be equally dangerous to exalt him into a sage and a hero, or to degrade him into a selfish op- pressor. Good sense, thrift, caution, knowledge of the world, derived from experience rather than from intuition, patience, self-control, and keen self-interest were the plain materials of a character which was cast in no heroic mould. These qualities of the lesser order were dilated in his person to very unusual pro- portions, and applied to very unusual ends but they never lost the stamp of what must bo termed, for want of a more appropriate phrase, the vulgarity of their nature. The impulses of enthusiasm, the glow of imagination, the pursuit of a great scheme of action, the indulgence of large sympathies or desires in policy or in government, were unknown to his character and to his reign. On one or two occasions intense acqui- sitiveness, animated by an unusual excess of traditional pride, tempted him to deviate into a passion, and imitate the policy of the loftiest of his ancestors. Occasionally his aversions prevailed over his better judgment, and in the last few months of his reiga his temper became testy and his resolutions incautious under the growing effect of age. But these were ex- ceptions to the general spirit of his government, and the transaction to which we particularly allude was entangled in a web of minute contrivances and intri- gues which seemed partially to conceal from the aged Monarch himself the amount of his own rashness, and the consequences of his design. It would be inconsistent with the essential qualities which we ascribe to Louis Philippe's character, to suppose that at any period of his life he was excited by dreams of vast ambition, or enabled by constancy of purpose to look onwards from the hardships of exile and proscription to the recovery of the throne of France. For his own happiness\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand, we will add, for his greater success\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhis aspirations were con- fined within narrower limits. At one time, indeed, as in the curious transactions of 1811, ambition seemed to invite the Duke of Orleans to play a more active part in the Spanish war at another, Greece, and even Mexico, allured him by the phantom of a throne but these adventures were not seriously pursued, and he s (te down after the restoration of the Bourbons T^d-,\u00c2\u00b0r at least resigned, to he the first Prince of the blood in France, and one of the richest person- ages in Eu ope. Yet, even in those uncertain years, his vigorous mind was not inactive. He alone, of all the Princes of the House of Bourbon, had spent his life in a contest of policy with the principles of the French Revolution. He alone had attempted to as- sume whatever garb the spirit of the age imposed on him, and to profit by the lessons of his past experi- ence. A sterner and a prouder man would have died a hundied deaths, rather than condescend to humour the popular passions, which twice in his life un- crowned his nearest relatives, and finally turned upon himself. Louis Philippe was affected by no such scruples and no sooner did he find that terms were proffered to him by those who might then have driven him into a second exile, than he ascended the throne under the auspices of a popular revolution. From that instant his policy changed but though the cur- rent was turned, its movement was slow, and at first all but insensihle, {' Ma luttetewice contreV anarchie\" (to use his own expression) became the settled pur- pose of his reign. The dazzling career of a Napoleon, and the blind resistance of Charles X, were alike im- possible yet the same, or even greater results, were to be accomplished by a sedulous employment of slender but multifarious means and those results were supposed to have been accomplished so effectu- ally that not only had the Court and the Ministry the firmest reliance upon their success, but even the Re- publican party had postponed the execution of its designs until the King's demise. The Revolution of February was alike unforeseen by all parties, and this confidence was undoubtedly the cause of the extraor- dinary neglect of the decisive measures which might have prevented it. The military exploits of Louis Philippe were con- fined to one campaign under Dumouriez, when he had not completed his twentieth year and although he took a part in the actions of Jemmapes and Val- my, those incidents in his life were only recalled when it was politic to connect his name with the prowess of the Republican armies. But of courage on all oc- casions but the last and greatest of his life the King displayed no ordinary share. On that fatal morning, when he fled from the Tuileries, the King was no longer himself; he was unneryed, he was old, and he field from the revolution, leaving everything in the dust. There certainly the high spirit of the House of Bourbon utterly failed him. On all other occasions it had been at once his greatest art and his greatest trial to keep the pride of his Royal race from awaken- ing the hostile passions of the country. The same want of elevation pervaded his moral as well as his intellectual being. To him great princi- pies were matters of as little concern as great truths. Perhaps at the bottom the tuition of Madame de Genlis, the Jacobin Club, and the rough usage of his early life had left him sceptical of both. He was the greatest master of what must be termed the craft of Kings that the world had behe d for more than a cen- tury. and he adapted the influence of Royalty, aided by his own personal dexterity, to the manners of a captious and democratic age. In all parties, in all professions, in every walk of life, and every mood of passion, the King loved to practise his powers of ad- dress. Few men in his sphere were inaccessible to his persuasive ingenuity, and it may be said that he disarmed more enemies by his tongue than he would have done by the rigour of persecution. For this purpose the hospitality of the Tuileries was indiscri- minately offered to men of all parties, and the King considered no affront unpardonable but that of a total e'trangement from the Court, and no man irreclaim- able but those who refused to listen to him. In the pursuit of his objects by these means he displayed incredible patience, drollery, and cunning, Even in dealing with his bitterest enemies\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthose who were leagued against his throne, and who had attempted his life, he invariably observed an admira- ble clemency, which for the first time marked a great political revolution. We have seen that his whole policy was repugnant to the violent measures and the hazardous adventures of more enterprising minds but it is not the less creditable to his name that he' should have persevered through good and evil report in that steadfast adherence to the cause of peace which has prolonged a million of human lives, averted in- calculable miseries, and strengthened the confidence of nations in those ties which have, for the first time, grown to maturity between them. A peaceful reign of seventeen years, over the most warlike people of huropp. still panting with the fever of a revolution and minMul of the reverses which closed the last is a phenomenon without a parallel in political his- tory; and the merit of him who accomplished this great work of policy is hut the more conspicuous amid those apprehensions which have followed his sudden down-fall. The authority we enjoyed in his own family was unbounded, and that control which few absolute Monarchs have possessed over the Princes of their own race was complete in the hands of Louis Philippe. He owed it to his playful disposition, which even at the close of his life could lay aside his cares and dig- nity to join in the sports of a child. He owed it to I the singular judgment he had shown in the education of his sons, and not less to their invariable confidence in his indulgent solicitude for their welfare. After they had reached the prime of manhood and assumed the duties of married life, his sons continued to inha- hit the same palace and to form a part of the same domestic circle. Without any excessive display of paternal authority, the Royal family continued wholly dependent on the King's advice and pleasure, and the divided interests of a Court were unknown. Nor in this allusion to the domestic ties of his life must ths names of those be omitted who shed ovei it the steady light of conjugal love and sisterly friendship. The purity and piety of the Queen, to whom he was de- voted with the most undeviating fidelity and affection, seemed to plead against the imperfections of his cha- racter, while the clear judgment and decision of Madame Adelaide held as it were a lamp to his path. It is remarkable that the death of his sister was so speedily followed by the gieat catastrophe of his reign, and that the Queen alone endeavoured to pre- vent the closing and irretrievable fault of his abdi- cation. In the more ordinary transactions of life he has been accused of an excessive love of money, and it is true that he judged of the value of human actions and principles by too sordid a standard. But he ex- pended his private fortune with great munificence, the public revenues with prodigality and he was less prone to amass money than to devote it to the purchase of popularity and political power. When suddenly driven back into exile, he who had been accused of amassing wealth had barely the means of obtaining the necessaries of life, and it has recently been proved, by the publication of the accounts of the civil list, that his average personal expenses did not exceed X400 a year. Of all his personal tastes, t'.at of building was perhaps the strongest, and the resto- ration of the Palace and Museum of Versailles at his own cost, the embellishment of Paris, and the resto- ration of the antiquities of France are splendid monu- ments of his reign. Although the administration of the public finances was inordinately profuse, immense sums were expended in public edifices of every kind, which remain for the ornament and utility of the country. In Paris alone Louis Philippe terminated all the great buildings which Napoleon had begun. He inherited from the Regent Orleans a love of science and even a taste for medicine and he had acquired in his travels a fondness, not common in a French Prince, for marine amusements. But the customary entertainments of a Court, the chase, military exer- cises, and play were comparatively unknown in his day, and they were sacrificed to the exigences of pub- lie opinion in a democratic community, ever jealous of the pleasures of Princes. Perhaps in these minute details the character of the man may be traced even more consistently than in his potitical actions. He rose without moral great- ness, he reigned without the affection of his people, and he fell without the compassion of the world. The last hours of his reign were a prey to an undignified panic his determinations fluctuated between the ex- tremes of weakness and absurdity and in his selfish eagerness to preserve the unhonoured fragment of a life which no one seriously menaced, he recoiled from the necessary exercise of force, and left the Fiench nation exposed to all the horrors of anarchy. That great event dissipated in an hour the whole fabric of his life, and left him despoiled of all that wealth, ambition, power, and artifice could bestow on man. The deepest lesson of human mutability which this generation of men had witnessed was complete and death has mercifully drawn its veil over the last strug- gles of old age, enfeebled, uncertain, of the future abandoned by the creatures of his former bounty, and vanquished by the revolutionary powers of France which no living man has yet permanently subdued.", "word": "2", "description": "\u2026 transactions of 1811, ambition seemed to invite the Duke of Orleans to play a more active part in the Spanish war at another, Greece, and even Mexico, allured him by the phantom of a throne but these adventures were not seriously pursued, and he s (te down after the restoration of the Bourbons T^d-,\u00b0r at least resigned, to he the first Prince of the blood in France, and one of the richest person- ages in Eu\u2026", "keyword": "Mexico", "hint": null, "title": "[No title]", "site": "welshnewspapersonline", "publish": "30thAugust1850", "start_date": "1850", "county": null, "search_id": 52, "type_": "News", "tag": null, "download_url": "http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3053233/3053235/9/Mexico", "newspaper": "The Pembrokeshire Herald and General Advertiser", "end_date": "1851", "reprint": null, "download_page": "http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3053233/3053235/9/Mexico", "page": "2"},
{"ocr": "CHEMISTRY FOR THE KITCHEN. VEGETABLE FOOD. In our previous articles on chemistry of the kitchen, we have adverted to the important tact, (that Ins been ofIate years so satisfactorily proved bv the united inv('stira'ioll of the most eminent chemists,) of the close correspondence. not to siy absolute coincidence of the various classes of animal and vegetable food; the different kind of pulse, the seeds of plants of the pea tribe, or as they are also termed leguminous vegetables, offer an additional instance of this close similarity. These plants contain in their seeds a very considerable quantity of substance, that appears precisely identical with the curd, or more properly the casein of milk and it may be remembered, th it, in speak- ing of the chemistry of that substance, we advised the teedin;; of milch cows with a certain proportion of b?ans, in order to increase the qu mtity of curd, or cheese-forming material in the milk. 0 Food, taKen into the body, serves two perfectly distinct purposes 1.1 the animal economy. One portion of it is a most entirely devoted to that portion of that part of the blood which, consumed in breathing, produces the natural warmth of the system; of this nature are such substances as starch, sugar, tat, oils, &c.; in the proper sense of the word they are not nutritious, although absolutelv essen- tial to life they pass away in the breathing, or if in large excess, are stored up in the body in the form of fat; these kinds of food, from their abounding in carbon, which when consumed in respiration, is the source of the heat of the body, are frequently termed carbonaceous, or respiratory foods; and if employed alone, a pure food of this kind is quite inc ipable of supporting life. \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 As the heat of the body is the same, viz.98\u00c2\u00b0 to 100\u00c2\u00b0 in all Climates, and every condition of the weather, it necessarily follows that persons in cold climates, and in winter will require a greater amount of warmth-giving food, than in warn: climates. or in summer for in truth the body may be justly compared to a stove, which re- quires a larger amount of fuel in winter than in summer, that fuel being carbonaceous or respiratory food. The fact makes clear the positive necessity which exists tor the increased quantity of such food eaten in the polar regions. He who is well fed,\" observes Sir J. Ross, resists cold better than the man who is stinted, while starvation from cold but too soon follows a starvation in food. This explains the resisting power of the natives of these frozen climes, their consumption of food being enor- mous and often incredible.\" During the whole of our march.\" writes Sir John Franklin, \"we experienced that no quantity of clothing could keip us warm while we f isted, but, on those occasions on which we were enabled to go to bed on a full stomach, we always passed the night in a warm and comfortable manner.\" We are apt to express our loathing and disgust against the habits of the polar natives, who devour immense quantities of|oil and flesh yet, in truth, we ought rather to admire that flexibility of the constitution of the human animaJ, which enables him to vary his tastes, and to ac- quire a liking, and even a strong relish, for what is, in his condition a necessary of existence. Sir John states that, it would be very desirable indeed, if our men could acquire a taste for Greenland food, since all experience has shown that the large use of oil and fat meats, is the true secret of life in these frozen countries, and that the natives cannot subsist without it; becoming diseased, and dying on a more meagre diet.\" The second use of food is to furnish the nourishment to the flesh of animals. In fact, the materials of our muscles, blood-vessels, andall our complicated internal organs exist ready-formed in our food. The gluten of wheat flour, to which allusion has already been made in these arliclts, is identical, in its chemical composition, with the fibrine or basis of the flesh of animals. And a peculiar principle to which we shall have occasion to refer to again in this article, viz.:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd iegumine\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda large component of peas, beans, and lentils is, in its composition, almost the same as the curd of milk. These kinds of food are termed, from their flesh and strength-giving powers, nutritious foods, or from a substance which enters into their composition, but which is not found in the other class-nilrqqenous foods it will, perhaps, be more in accordance with the simple language we have always endeavoured to employ in these slight essays, it we speak of these two kinds of substances as the warmth-giving and strength-giving articles of diet it must be borne in mind, how<-ver, that these substances are not alone all that are required by mar; bone-making miterials, such as exist in the bran of wheat, &c., and green fresh vegetable matters, which are rich in saline substances, are both essential to prolong healthy existence. If we examine the various vegetables in use for food, we shall find, that in many instances the warmth-giving substances are in considerable excess. Potatoes and rice which form the staple diet of immense numbers of people', are in this list. They contain so little of these nutritious' substances that in order to obtain a sufficient supply for the nutrition of the body, an immense quantity must be eaten beyond all proportion of what would be necessary, if a slight addition could be made to the strength giving substances. The fact is, that the people living on such vegetables endeavour to add nutritious substances to their food. In Ireland, the warmth-giving starch of the potato is endea- voured to be improved by theaddition of flesh-giving curd contained in buttermilk. At Quito, in Mexico, the daily food of the inhabitants is potatoes and cheese. It is com- monly stated that rice is the food of whole nations in I ndia; but the fact wou'd not appear precisely so; and we may here quote M. Lequerri, who during a long residence in India paid great attention to the manners and customs of the inhabitants of Pondicherry. \"The food,\" says M. Lequerri, \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2' is almost entirely vegetable and rice in the staple; the inferior castes never eat meat, but all eat kari, an article prepared with meat, fish, and vegetables; which is mixed with rice, bo )-d with a very little water. It is requisite to have seen the Indians eat, to have any idea of the enor nous quantity of rice they will put into their stomachs. No European could cram so much at a time, and they very commonly allow that rice alone will not nourish them. It is owing to the small quantity of strength.giving substances in potatoes alone, that a labouring Irishman requires from twelve to fourteen pounds a day. An interesting and useful table has been given by Dr. Lyon Playfair, of the quantity of various kinds of foods which contains one pound of nitrogenous, or nutritious substances -and to each is added the cost of that quan- tity by which, it will at once be seen, that potatoes are amongst the dearest of all kinds of food for the working man, if their real value in use, and not the price by weight be taken into account. One pound of nitrogenous substance is contained in lbs. s. d. 25 Miik.

V table',hat Peas and beans furnish fond tho PnCe greatest quantity of strength-giving food the same may be stated of the other leguminous seeds, such as lentils and haricots, the latter being the runner 3 distinct Plant from the scarlet The value of leguminous seeds, or pulse, is not suffi- ciently known, or appreciated in this country with the exception of the common dried peas, no pulse is exten- sively used in a dry state; perhaps this may arise from prejudice, and also from the circumstance, that they arc- when dried, not so quickly and easily digested as grain, more especially it not well cooked. With those persons who can digest them, they form the best possible diet for supporting bodily exertion upon this effect of their use is well known in the case of the horse, and to their inlfuence, in hardening and increasing the strength of the muscular fibre, may be attributed the well-known fact that bean fed bacon is always tough: it may be remarked, in passing, that as the object in feeding bacon hogs is to increase the tat, and not harden the flesh, the kinds ot lood which abound in carbonaceous matters are most advantageous. During the recent scarcity ot potatoes, the seed of the dwarf white kidney bean, which are known as harricots, came into tolerably extensive use in this country. On the continent they form a constant and highly esteemed article of food. but with us they seem nearly to have gone out of use, with the scarcity of potatoes. Whether this was owing to the fact that they did not suit the English taste, or whether, as we believe, they were most impro- perly cooked, is not certain. We believed it to be owing to the latter cause, and performed a series of experiments on the best method of preparing them the usual plan was to put the dried beans into water, and boil them for about two hours, this had the effect of rendering the casein more fixed, and less capable of rapid digestion, than if they were soaked over-night in cold water. But, by re- peated experiments, we have found that by far the most advantageous method is to malt them-that is, to allow them to commence their growth, or germination this is best done by soaking them for about twelve hours in cold water, which is to be poured off at the end of that time, and the beans allowed to remain about thirty hours before being cooked when they require a much shorter time for boiling, become more mealy, are much sweeter to the taste, and form one of the most wholesome, readily digestible, nutritious, and economical kinds of food. This process acts by converting a portion of the starch of the bean, (of which it contains about thirty parts in every hundred,) into sugar, and by breaking up the whole tissue, makes the various parts much more soluble in the digestive fluid. We found that, treated in this manner, even the dried broad beans form a most pleasant food. If the beans are allowed to remain much more than thirty hours, after being soaked, growth goes on so quickly, that the young root pushet through the skin, which becomes clammy, and commences to decay, as it does not, like the growing part of the seed, possess vitality. Another leguminous plant is, under several assumed names, coming into very exten- sive use in this coutry. It is the lentil, the seeds of the plant known to botanists by the name ervum lens. They form a most valuable article of diet, containing a larger portion 01 flesh-making substances than any other kind of pulse, and, consequently, more nutritious when digested. 1 hey are used extensively in eastern countries, beinsr always employed by the Hindoos when engaged in any very laborious work, and on the continent are made into soups, employed as split peas are with us, and used in a variety of Ways. as t])ey possess the advantage of bein readily softened by mixing with water, so as to form soiids and potages. In this country, lentils have got into the hands of the quacks, and under the specious names of UHvaloni-j >> Ervalenta,Arabian Revalenta,\" &c., (which, it may be observed, are slight transpositions of the botanical name ot ervum lens), they are, when ground into flour putted off as a remedy for all the disorders that flesh is heir to. Oneempyric states that they hdve cured paralysis, aneurism, and epilepsy and these statements, strange to say, are authorised by the names of lords, ladies, arch- deacons, and a host of other influential simpletons. 1 hese nostrums are nothing more than simple flour of 1 vv'Jit;l1 may he obtained of any respectable corn- chandler, at something like one-twentieth of the price charged by the vendors of these well-advertised prepara- tions. Under these disguises, lentils have had a very large sale; and so far as their own merits are concerned the success is deserved. Their value is so great as an article of diet, that it is much to be desired that they should become a popular food. W.

ANTIQUITY OF ASCERTAINING CHARACTER FROM HANDWRITING.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd In the early part of the reign of Louis the Fourteenth, a Boulognese, named Primi, who pos- sessed a handsome face, and was am in of wit, and an adventurer, who had no objection to make his fortune by the best means that offered, came to France to see what good luck might befal him. During his journey from Lyons to Paris he made the acquaintance of one Claude Duval, a particularly clever enterprising person, who, on their arrival, presented him to the Abbe de la BauITiY, afterwards Archbishop of Embrun. This reverend per- sonage suddenly conceived the idea of playing off a novel and ingenious hoax, which has been une singuliere mystifica- twn. Finding in the boldness and finesse of Primi together with his dialect, made up of Italian and French, his. adroitness and peisonal address, if1l the qualities desirable for the execution of his project, he shut himself up with turn for six weeks, seeing Lobody else, excepting the Duke de Vendome, and the Grand Prior of France, his brother, to whom he presented Primi. AI three employed the whole of this time in teaching Primi the private hIstory 01 persons of the court-their intrigues, theIr friendships, their loves, their hatreds, &c. A\" soar. as they considered him sufficiently indoctrinated, the Abbe de la Baume spread it abroad that he knew an Italian from whom nothing in the past or future was hidden, the moment he set his eyes on the handwriting of any person concerning whom anything was >ought to be known. They took care that the first signature should be that of a person whose history was fully known to Primi, by their instructions. Lords and ladies, all the wealthy middle class, men and women, the court and city, hurried to Primi with autograph letters, and signatures in their band, and all came away dumbfounderedat his answers! From what he had told them of the past, they fully believed all he told them of the future. The Countess of Soissons, above all, took him under hcr patronage. From her he accidentally extracted all sorts of intrigues of the court, the whole ot which he most promptly turned to good account. From the wonderful things that Primi told her about herself, she described him to the King as a man of preternatural gifts, and begged his Majesty to allow Primi to examine hishandwriting. After some hesitation, the King sent a letter rpparently in his own hand, which the Countess immediately took to Primi. The Italian examined it carefully, any informed the Countess that this writing was that of an old miser, a usurer, a sort of old pawnbroker\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda fellow incapable of any good action. The lady stood confounded. She assured him that this once he had blundered most stupidly, but Primi persisted in assuring her that he had made no mistake. The countess took back the letter to the King, ar.d in courtly language conveyed to him Primi s interpretation of the character of his Majesty's handwriting. His Majesty was astonished, for the letter was, in fact, not his handwriting, but that of M. le President Rose, his private secretary, who so closely imitated the King's handwriting that Louis continually made him write letters which he wished to he supposed in his own hand. This fact Primi hnd previously learnt from one of his instructors, the Duke de Vendome, together with the private character of M. le Present Rose. The King was determined to fathom the mystery it was too deep and perplexing to be endured. The next morn- ing he ordered his chief valet de chambre to bring the Italian to him in his private cabinet. 1 nmi, said his Majesty, I have only two words to sav\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdyour secret \u00c2\u00bb_ for which I will give you a pension ot *000; it.not\u00c2\u00bb 'be gallows!\" It is hardly necessary to say which of the two was chosen by the Italian.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdDickon's tlotisehold llo\u00c2\u00bb\u00c2\u00abs. THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW.-A sad scene took place on board one of the boats on the Erie Canal. A man, woman, and child were on board the boat, endeavouring to escape to Canada. The crew of the boat in which they were learned that they were fugitives, and immediately devised a plan to trouble and terrify them, probably thereby finding amusement. On Monday night some of the human fiends, in prosecution of their plans, went to the berth of the man Harris, and, awaking informed him that his master was on board the boat, and that theywouid surrender him and family into his hands. Harris drew a dirk, with which he was armed for self defence, drove the scoundrels on deck, and by by his decisive manner and actionskeptthematbayuntitmorning. In the morning he was informed that his master had left the boat, and gone on to Syracuse, but would there meet him on the arrival of the boat. On Tuesday evening, about 5 o'clock, the boat cametLl a stopping-place at the first Lodi Lock, about a mile east of this city. As is often the case, a number 01 persons went aboard the boat. Harris supposed they came to take him, being so informed by some of the crew. In his desperation he seized his razor, and drawing it forcibly across his throat, jumped into the canal. His wife, with their child in her arms, leaped after him; all determined to die rather than again come under the slave- holder's power. Efforts were then made to rescue 'he drowning family. Harris and his wife were got out, but the child was drowned. DISTURBANCE AT ST. BARNABAS, PIMLICO.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn Sunday morning last, at the end of the service, a dis- turbance took place at St. Barnabas, Pimlico. Mr. W. Bennett had at the close of his sermon dwelt on the subject of private confession, and either from this cause, or in consequence of the ceremonial which followed the sermon, a cry of \"No Popery!\" was raised by some persons present, and responded to by the cries of Shame from another part ot the congregation. There was a .great crowd outside the Church, and the disorder became so great that it was not thought advisable to open the Church in the evening, when a mob of about 600 people had collected at the door, apparently bent upon mischief. THE \"Bishop of Northampton\" has issued a pastoral in which he \"hesitates not to say, that the present out- break of indignant feeling, the violent declamation, the furious onslaught, and the unscrupulous misrepresentation of the public press, against the Sovereign Pontiff and our- selves-the English Bishops, exhibit a little short of insanity He contends that the Pope has the fullest right to do what he has done, and that the law of England recognizes that right.. A carter at Liverpool, who always carried about with him the savings of many years of industry and self-denial, amounting to upwards of 100 guineas, was robbed by a fellow-lodger, who abstracted his trousers, containing the hoard, from under his pillow. The thief decamped in the night and when taken by the police \u00c2\u00a3 85 was found in his possession. The carter told the magistrate that he \"'never dare trust the banks; they were always a breaking, or summut.\" A, LUCIFER MATCHES.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAccording to Mr. Mayhew, in the Morning Chronicle, in one steam sawing mill visited by him the average number of splints made for Inciter matches istMOOOfrrossnfhoxesinayear.eachboxcor.taming 50 splints, altogether 1,123,200,000 matches.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE.-The Paris papers of Sunday do not con. tain any political intelligence. The Prefect of the Seine has received an answer from Lord Granville, accepting his invitation to a series cf f6tes. A steamer will arrive oil' Folkestone on Friday next, nnd transport the Coiii- missioners to Boulogne, where an express train will carry them to Paris. A grand dinner is to be given in hmiour of that distinguised body on Saturday. On M outlay the balls will commence, and the remainder of I the week, up to Friday n'/ain, is to be spent in visiting Paris and its environs, when they will be sent back in the same manner as they started. Accounts from Algiers to the 20th ult. announce further successes of the ex- peditionary column in Kabylia. The most important was on the 17th, when the KabilPtlleft one hundred men dead on the field of battle, among whom was a chief who had been one of the most inveterate enemies of the French. This victory was regarded as the successful winding-up of the operations, and the troops were returning to their garrisons after a short but brilliant campaign, in which there bad been altogether twenty-six combats, all to the advantage of the French army. The French Legislature, like our own, is looking for- ward to the briefer holiday conceded to it by that con- stitution which it declines to revise. For it is the busi- ness of the French Assembly to watch, Argus-like, with six hundred pair of eyes, the movements of the Executive power. Weeks, not months, are the measure of the Parliamentary vacation in a country where the so- vereignty is elective, and pheasant shooting is unknown. The little outbreak of peevishness which occurred last week is already forgotten. The ministers censured by the Assembly retain their places at the President's request and the thing blows over in an hour. A good illustration of the old remark, that by atttempting to make the Sovereign responsible as well as his advisers, you destroy, in effect, the responsibility of both. From a question and answer exchanged in the House of Com- mons last week, we learn that a protest, jointiy presented by Great Britain and France, against the annexation of the out-lying provinces of the Austrian Empire, has been set aside hy the Frankfort Diet, on the ground that the question is not one of European concern. Of course it is one thing to reject a protest of this kind, and another to disregard it. The value of a protest, however, depends less upon its intrinsic justice than on the attitude of the Power which makes it; and Austria has at present not much to apprehend from the pacific demeanour of England and France. SPAIN.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMazzini'a incendiary proclamations have been circulated in Madrid, recommending the Spanish democrats to be prepared to act at the first signal, as the time is ap- proaching for the overthrow of all the thrones in Europe. It was believed, however, that such incendiary publications would have but little effect amongst the population.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA telepraphic despatch announces that on the 26th ult., the bill for the settlement of the debt was adopted in the Senate, by a majority of o9 to 19. POUTUGAL.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Morning Post, at once the inconsis- tent organ of the Miguelites abroad and Lord Palmerston at home, in jts first character reports the meeting of a thou- sand Legitimists at Lisbon on the 10th ult., assembled under the presidency of the Count de Barbacena, to decide on the course to be pursued by the Legitimist party in the existing circumstances of Portugal; whether they should continue to abstain\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdas they have done since 1833\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdfrom taking any part in public business, or, following the example of the French Legitimists, assume that political position to which they are entitled by their rank, numbers, and property. They decided upon remaining neutral. They resolvod that the tuo journals, La Nacoa,\" published at Lisbon, and the \u00c2\u00ab' Portugal,\" at Oporto, should be considered their organs. ITALY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdSome misunderstandinif has arisen again at Rome between the French and Papal authorities. When first occupying Rome some of the French troops were quartered at the office-i of the Holy Inquisition some time after, however, they gave up the building to the Congrega- tion of the Holy Office, who got it repaired at a cost of 15,000f., and were enabled to occupy it but a few months ago. On the 16th the French commission for quartering the troops suddenly received information that the seventh battalion of foot chasseurs was coming on the followiug evening. Not knowing where to quarter thein at so short a notice, the commissioners immediately sent to the Holy Office, announcing in rather an imperious tone their inten- tion of taking possession of the buildings, and demanding the immediate removal of the offices of the Inquisition. At urgent request, three days were granted for removing archives, &c., and, failing to find another suitable residence, the Pope has been obliged to lodge the Inquisition in the Vatican. An attempt was made, on the llth ult., to assassinate Monsignor Tizzani, Bishop of Terni, by blowing up the houie he inhabited at Santa Maria Maggiore. Fortunately, the inceudiary missile exploded before it reached its des- tination. The friends of the prelate had been previously invited, by an anonymous handbill to attend his funeral. A story is going the round of the papers of a fast young man,\" who recently died at Pis., rejecting the good offices of sundry monks, who threatened him with the deVIl; and deceased exacting a promise from a friend that he would not leave his body uutil it was buried. The fne\" ? \"rj sican, accordingly watched over the body in t le urial ground. At dead of night, the devil\" stood by his sIde, draped in black and red, having enormous horns and a long tail. He was asked what he wanted; but as he gave no intelligible reply, and made advauces towards the body. the Corsican drew a psitol and shot the devil dead. He proved to be the convent bellman The Coraican was tned for the murder. He pleaded his belief that he ^as rea y a tacked by the devil, and was acquitted, lhe story we must confess wears a gieat air of fabrication. The Veteran Radeizsky has i.\"ued a proclamation from his head quarters at Monza, declaring the Lombardo Vene- tian Kingdom once more in a state of siege. Martin law, he says, is not disagreeable to good aud peaceable citizens, because- The result of the recent judicial investigations and several facts which have occurred recently have convinced me that the parties whose sole object is the overthrow ofsocial order, not content with the misfortunes they have already occasioned, have again secretly planned a scheme for trampling under loot all respect for religion and the laws, and for endangering the lives and properties of all honourable and peaceable citizens, and for preventing all return of confidence in the Government.\" TURIN, JULY 24.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe attention of Government has been attracted to the numerous military occupations which have been ordered by Austria along the Po and the Tessin. The object of Austria is to obtain from Piedmont similar commercial advantages to those which have recently been atTorded to England. It is impossible to foresee the issue of this demand on the part of Austria. THE RUSSIAN DEFEAT IN TUB CAUCASUS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLetters from Warsaw confirm the defeat of General Neisterow, at Sere- brickow, and the flight of the Russians on the plains of Tifli*. The loss of the army in men, ammunition, and horses is far greater than has been sustained for years; .e se expense have 1ieen'\u00c2\u00bb(\u00c2\u00bbain lost. Report adds that one of the commanders of the Hun- garian campaigns is to be commamler-in-chief of the Caucasian army.-Staal, Courant, July 24. AMERICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe United States' mail steam-ship, Hermann, arrived at Cowes, Monday, has brought letters and papers from New York to the 12th ult. The vessel has 300,000 dollars on board. At Washington the court- martial on General Talcott had found him guilty of the charges. The finding has been approved by the Presi- dent and he has been dismissed from the service, without any reservation. Captain Frazier, of the revenue service now stationed in California, has been dismissed by the President for tyrannical conduct and violation of the Act of Congress abolishing flogging. According to dates from the city of Mexico to the 24th ult,, the Mexican Government had issued a decree prohibiting all labour and scientific examinations of the Tehuantepec route, and ordering all Americans concerned to leave there- public. Troops had been sent out to enforce this decree. The steamer United States, bouud for Tehuantepec, had been refused a clearance at New Orleans by the Mexican Consul.-A terrible storm had raged on the Texas coast for several days. The steamer Maria Burt was totally lost; many houses in Texas were blown down, and the young cotton crop is partially destroyed. INDIA, riie Timet has received letters and papers in anticipation of the overland mail which left Bombay ou the 25th ult. The following is from the letter of a correspon- dent:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" The season of rain and inaction has now fairly set in, and Indian official absenteeism is at its height. Three of the four Presidencies are at present deseited by their Governors, and by all who are able to follow their example, for the more agreeable climates of the Hill and above the Ghaut stations. The western frontier of the Punjab re- mains tranquil the adjacent hill tribes are said to be fully employed in fighting among themselves. It is reported in Peshawur that another battle had taken place at Balkh, in which the troops of Dhost Mahomed were victorious Dhost Mahomed's sons were said to have divided the country into four parts, each taking possession of one. The tranquillity of the Punjab has induced the Governor-General to direct the release of72 political prisoners who had been sentenced to various terms of imprisonment as rebels. An event, however, occurred at Umritsir, on the 10th of June, which might have been attended with serious conse- quences. A drunken European soldier who had been placed in confinement for desertion, managed to get po'-sussion of a sword, and with it cut down Jewan Singh, the comman- der of a Sikh regiment forming part of the garrison. The death of their commander naturally occasioned much excite- ment at the time in Jewan Singh's regiment, but the mur- derer having been imprisoned to stand his trial, all was quiet asrain by the following morning. Jewan Singh was a very distinguished Sikh officer, who had doue good service to the British Government both before and since annexation, for which the Government had rewarded him by trebling his pay and presenting him with a sword aud dress of honour. The Bengal military authorities have called on all the regiments of that army for returns of the expenses, debts, and assets of their several messes. When these returns have been received, a committee Is to ba formed for the purpose of drawing up a code of mess regulations for the Bengal army. The object of the proposed reform is, of course, to discourage the extravagance complained of in Sir C. Napier's general order. Indian railway operations continue to a Ivance rapidly; 28 miles of the Calcutta line, and about the same extent of that at Bombay, are now in the hands of the contractors, a i. a n.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdr(, is little doubt that next year will see the first sec- tionsof | The suppression of the State allowance t, the temple of Juggcmauth, and some cases which have been decided in accordance with the recently passed Toleration Act (No. 21 of 1850), having given rise to an anti-missionary movement among the orthodox Hindoos at Calcutta. A great meeting of orthodox Hindoos has been held at Calcutta, for the pur pose of substituting a milder form of expiation. It was stated at the meeting that there were 50 Christian converts at Calcutta, who would return to the Hindoo creed as soon as the milder form of penance was assented to. There is little doubt that it will be so eventually. All things con- sidered, the number of converts to Christianity made in Bengal and Western India is astonishingly small. In the Bombay Presidency there are about 50 missionaries of va- riom denominations, yet a conversion Is very seldom heard of. This result is very discouraging when contrasted with the rapid, extended, and permanent success obtained by the Jesuit missionaries of the European Power that preceded us in Western India. The principal news from Bombay is of shipwreck. On the llth of June the Atiet Rohoman, a ship having on board 350 pilgri,ns returning from Mecca, was wrecked on the island of Kennery, while attempting to make the harbour in thick weather. Nearly 200 of her crew perished. On the same day the bark Charlotte struck on a reef at Jingoora, to the south of Bombay Harbour, and became a total wreck, her crew, with two exceptions, saving themselves on rafts. The Charles Forbe-, of Bombay, was also lost on the 28th of April in the Straits of M-dacca. Colonel Ogilvie, the Judge-Advocate-General of the Bombay army, died at Poonnh on the 18th ult. Colonel Ogilvie had served in India for half a century, and no officer had ever a higher character, or was more universally liked and respected. Dr. Carr, the Bishop of Bombay, has inti- mated his intention of resigning his diocese. By the Jatcxt accounts from Hong Kong, the progress of the rebellion in the southern provinces of China appeari still to be un- checked, but there is great difficulty in obtaining authentic intelligence from the disturbed districts. The latest Mauritius papers received exult in the flourish- ing condition and progress of that colony. The Australian papers are filled with the details of elec- tions. which seem to be as ardently contested as they are in England. There is little moral doubt remaining that the murderer of Lieutenant Johnstone, of the 3rd Madras Light Cavalry (who, it will be remembered, was sh 't through lhe back in broad day, while seated with his wile at; table in his own house,) was a ci-devant Havildar in that regiment, who had been reduced to the ranks by Lieutenant Johnstone.

{"ocr": "ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO. liiEvear upon which we have now entered, will com- plete the first half of the nineteenth century, the most eventful since the apostolic age: and the present seems a fitting moment for easting back a hasty glance at the corresponding point in the pteceding century. in order to gain some notion of the magnitude of the changes that have taken place in the intervening years, and of the accelerated rate of the social movement. How did we stand as a country, a nation, in relation to Christendom and the world i hundred years ago ? In the year 1750, the British thtone was filled by the second monarch of the House of Hanover. Four years before, the battle of Cnlloden luti given the death-blow to the cause and hopes of the Pretender. The- other reigning European sovereigns were, Louis XV., the emperor Francis [. and Maria Theresa, Pope Benedict XIV., Philip V., of Spain, Elizabeth, empress of Russia, and Frederick the Great. These names, will. however, scarcely recall the reldtive positions of the several powers of Europe. The treaty of Aix-le-Chapelle (174i!) had introduced a hollow and precarious peace and temporary settlement, which soon gave way before the ambitious projects and military successes of Frederick the Great. England was then but a second-rate power, too feeble to cope with the great potentates of the continent. A hundred years ago. the king of Great Britain could not number above twelve or thirteen millions ot subjects, including- the population of all the colonies and settlements in the Western Hemisphere. The American colonies containett not more three millions; and the French, then masters of Canada and Louisiana, laid claim to the valley of the Mississippi, and projected the expulsion of the British cotonistsfromthecontinent. In India, too, they appeared virtual masters of the Deccan, and threatened the destruction of the British settlements in Bengal. When, in 1757, the great Earl of Chatham was called to the helm of an almost foundering State, the critical position of our national affairs had thrown a deep gloom over the public mind. At one time, England and Prussia had to withstand the powerful confedeiacy of France, Austria, Russia, Sweden, and Saxony on the continent, while the maritime powers of Holland and Portugal were our formidable commercial rivals; Spain still enjoyed the rich monopoly of her nine vice-royalties in the new world of Columbus, and Portugal held Brazil. But France was the ascendant power. Paris was the literary metropolis of Europe, and ltome the recognised centre of Christendom The English language was scarcely spoken or understood by any hut natives of the British isles and their American descendants. Nothing would at that time h ve appeared more improbable, than that the power of this insulated nation shonld, within a century, become politically and morally paramount that its chain of colonies should girdle the globe, that its merchants should be inheritors of the Mogul empire, lords of the Indies and of Guinea; and that the Anglo-Saxon race and language, naturalized in the Western Hemisphere, should spread from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and displace alike the French on the North, and the Spanish in the basin of the Gulf of Mexico! In territorial extent, the British empire, inferior only to that of Russia, is almost three times as vast as that of Imperial Rome while adding that giant Republic which has grown up out of its American colonies within the last seventy years, we have an area of more than seven millions of square miles with an aggregate population of at least a hundred and eighty millions of souls, under the dominant influence, not indeed of one government, but of one nation, originally confined to a small island in the German ocean, and which was scarcely able to maintain a footing in India, in America, in Africa, or on the European continent itself, a hundred years ago. A hundred years ago, the state of our geographical knowledge was as limited as our political influence. Cook had not then navigated the South Seas Polynesia and Australia were names unknown to geography; no Hum- boldt had then climbed the Andes; the valley of the Mississippi had not been explored; no European traveller had ascended the Nile beyond the first cataract; the Niger was wholly veiled in mystery; and the Brahma- pootra was unknown, even by name, among the rivers of India. The languages and dialects of the Eastern world were as little known as the physical aspect and phenomina of the countries. No Sir William Jones had arisen to set the example of1 Oriental scholarship as a polite accom- plishment the Sanscrit had as yet attracted no attention from western philologists; the Holy Scriptures had been translated into few vernacular dialects, except those of Western Europe; no Carey or Morrison, no Martin or Judson had girded themselves to the task of mastering those languages which had been hitherto defied, like an impenetrable rampart, all attempts to gain access to the mind of India or China. A hundred years ago, there were neither Protestant Missionary Societies nor Protestant Missions, save only those which had been formed for the propagation of the gospel in the American colonies, the Danish missions in Southern India, and the Moravian missions iin Greenland and South Africa. In fact, the obstacles to success in almost every part of the world, arising from the ascendancy and intolerance of the Papal, Mohammedan, and Pagan powers, added to the deficiency of our knowledge and the poverty of our knowledge and the poverty of our resources, would have proved little short of insurmountable. A hundred years ago, the moral aspect of society was as dark and discouraging, both at home and abroad, as the political prospect was gloomy. The state of courtly and clerical morals is betrayed in the too accurate portraitures of manners in the contemporary writings of Fielding, Smollett, and Richardson. The prevalence of popular ignorance and irreligion of the grossest kind, is shown by the reception given to the early labours of Wesley and Whitefieid. In the eloquent language of Robert Hall, the creed established by law had no sort of influence in forming the sentiments of the people; the pulpit had completely vanquished the desk; piety and puritanism were confounded in one common reproach; an almost pagan darkness in the c ncerns of salvation prevailed and the English people became the most irreligious upon earth. Such was the state of things when Whitefieid and Wesley made their appearance.\" The first Methodist society was formed in 1730. Twenty-eight years after- wards. tile number of preachers in England, (according to to the Minutes of Conference.) was only 76; and of members, 22,642. In 1750, tfieeefore the Methodists must have formed a very inconsiderable body. The state of the Nonconformist Churches at that time, presented little to relieve the dreariness of the picture. At the beginning of the century, according to Neal, there were 2,354 Churches of the three denominations in England of these, the majority were Presbyterian. Sixty years afterwards, they were computed at 1,509. Meantime, the Arianism of Whiston and Emlyn had begun to infect the pulpits and academies of the Presbyterirn body, and a death-like formalism had spread over the community. Dr. Doddridge died in 1750; and in the following year, Dr. J. Taylor openly broached the Socinian tenets in his Scripture doctrine of the Atonement.\" The want of an earnest evangelical ministry among the orthodox dissenters is the subject of lamentation and complaint in the publi- cations of the day. It would not be easy to fix upon a period since the Reformation, when the religious life of the country was reduced to a lower ebb than about the middle of the last century. Deism\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe deism of Hume -was extending itself among the learned and professional classes, and practical irifidnlity was everywhere prevalent among the lower orders. Yet, we sometimes hear the present age spoken of as peculiarly an age of abounding infidelity! \"Say not thou, what is the cause that the former days were better than these; for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.\" But we must hasten to conclude this retrospect with a few miscellaneous references. In February and March, 1750, two slight shocks of an earthquake were felt in London; and the apprehensions which they excited. were further increased by the prediction of a fanatic, a soldier, that another shock would speedily ensue, which would lay all London and Westminster in ruins. Great numbers fled to the fields in consternation, and could hardly be persuaded to return when the time fixed for the accom- plishment of the prediction was past. At the time, the total population of the metropolitan parishes within the Bills of Mortality was but 674,356. The (population of England and Wales was under six millions and a half. That of all Lancashire was under 300,000. In 1750. the National Debt was but seventy millions. Yet, it may be mentio ied, whether the burden of taxation did not press as heavily then as now, and whether the vast increase of the Dt bt has n t been c mpei sited by the prodigious I augmentation of the wealth and resources of the country. What would have been thought, a hundred years ago, or sinking a capital of hundreds of millions in the construc- tion 01 railways In 1750, Westminster Bridge, commenced in 1738, was first opened prior to which, old London Bridge retained its undisputed honours. Years later, barges attended the Fleet river with the tide to Holborn Bridge; Blackfriars Bridge was not begun till 1760, and was finished in 1770. At that time, Clie,pside itself was not paved with flag- stones, and the footway was defended by posts, while almost every shop had its projecting sign, It would be easy to multiply similar curious indications of the very different aspect which the metropolis itself presented a hundred years ago. Since then, what prodigious events have rapidly suc- ceeded each other The American Revolution, followed at no distant interval, by the French of 1789 thirty years of European wars the European Revolution of 1830; the conquest of India the colonization of Australia and New Zealand the formation of the Bible Society and the several Missionary Societies the extraordinary pro- gress in geographical discovery the development of the wonderful powers of steam the discoveries in chemistry which have rendered it almost a new science ;\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdbut, above all, the prodigious expansion of the wealth and monetary power, the commercial enterprise and manufacturing industry, the territorial empire, and the moral supremacy, the religious institutions and voluntary munificence and zeal, of Protestant England;\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin a waid, the glorious phenomenon of the British empire. It is not in the spirit of vnin-glorious boasting that we use this language, but with a devout sense of the high national responsibility attaching to both rulers and people.

FRIGHTFUL ACCIDENT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn Friday morning, a melan- choly accident occurred in the city to Mr. Francis Field, a cashier in the Balk of Logland. The unfortunate gen- tleman was on his way to the Bank, and while crossing Prince's-atreet, towards Threadneedle-street, he was knocked down by the horses attached to a heavily-laden waggon, and before the driver could stop the vehicle the near wheels passed over his right leg, and afterwards acrossbistoins. Several of the loot passengers who wit- nessed the accident ran to him and raised him up, but he was found to be most fearfully injured. No hopes are given of Lis recovery. ABOLITION OF THE TITHE OFFICE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe have just heard apiece of new which the Ilublic will, no doubt, receive with pleasure-the Tithe Office, at Somerset House, Is to be abolished. Ten clerks were discharged last month, and 10 more will be in the course of the present. This arises from, we are informed, there being no more business now to'do, the tithes thouphout England being nearly wholly commuted. We regret th it among the individuals discharged, aud to be discharged, are several who have served the government at very moderate salaries from 14 to 20 years, and are to be dismissed without any pension, with only a gratuity of one yeai's salary, many of tbeqj l>eiog advanced io yw8.

One afternoon, as I was tending my doll Ophelia, who was sick in hcd, I heard a brisk dis- cussion among these girls, which, I may almost say, deci- ded my fate for life. The first words that caught my attention came from an animated, romantic girl of sixteen, scolding because the heroine of a novel she had just read was left umnamedat the end of the story. What surprise was expressed at this catastrophe!\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwhat indignation! One of my sisters did not seem to sympathise with this burst of disapprobation, and then came the pithy question, What! would you be willing to die an old maid?\" Mary said very quietly, Yes and sister Ellen added, 00 would Iti Vnil Then such looks of amazement and incredolity. can't mean what you say,\" cried one. n\u00c2\u00b0 know you too well to think you a hypocrite, .s,a.u' an\u00c2\u00b0~ tlier.

Never did a bevy of fifty-year-old spinsters litter so much scandal in one afternoon as was poured fourth by these young creatures. Two or three friends of my mother, whom 1 had always cherished in my innocent alfections, because they talked so pleasantly and were so kind to me now appeared like new personages. Miss Z. was so ugly, she never could have had an offer!\" \"Miss Y. dressed so shabby, and wore green spectacles to look literary.\" And Miss X. was for ever talking about Sunday-school and society-meetings, and so on. Y ou may be sure that the next time these ladies come to our house, I scanned very closely the face of Miss Z., a face that I had always loved before; but now I saw that it was exceedingly plain. I looked hard at Miss Y's drab- coloured bonnet and shawl, perceived that they were old- fashioned and ordinary, and that her green spectacles looked pedantic. \\Vhen ?lIiss X\" besi(le whom I h;\u00c2\u00a1\u00c3\u00b9 alw -ys squeezed in upon the sofa,encouraged by her kindly sniiic and delighted wit 1 her conversation\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhow uninter- esting she had become They were all old mauls!

Many a judicious mother's morning exhortation has been blown to the moon bv some slight remark from a dinner guest, who did not after all mean to give his real opinion, or whose opinion was not worth having. And now, I assure you, my education went on rapidly. It is perfectly marvellous in how many ways, and by what different sorts of people, a young girl is taught that it is a terrible thing to be an old maid. Fools show their folly more than in their hackneyed jests upon this topic but what shall we say of the wise folks who sin almost as often in the same wav? what shall we say if the refinement of him who is gentlemanly in thought and expression on all subjects hut this of the humanity and chivalry of him who assails the defenceless?\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdof the justice of him who taxes a class with the faults of individuals, and wounds with that meanest of weapons\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda sneer ?-or of the Chris- tianity of him who indirectly censures and ridicules one of the arrangements of Providence ? I learned my lesson thoroughly, for it came to me in some shape every week. I read it in every novel and newspaper, and heard it from every lip. The very man who spoke truth and sense on the subject, sometimes neu- tralised it by an idle jest in some moment of levity, and the jest drove out the truth from my young heart. At eighteen, I lived only tor the ignoble purpose-I cannot bear to say-of getting married but what could have been the ruling wish of one who bad been taught by society to dread celrbacy worse than death? I daresay I betrayed it in the ball room, in the street, everywhere. I dare say I was duly laughed at. At last, quaking on the verge of six-and-twenty, I had an oiler ;-a most absurd one. I was six years older tnan my lover, had ten times as much sense, probably, except on one point. I knew that he was \"rather wild,\" as the gentle phrase goes. In short, I neither loved nor res- pected him; but I was willing to marry him, because then I should be Mrs. Somebody, and should not be an old maid. Mv parents said No,\" positively. Of course I thought them unreasonable and cruel, and made myself very mise- rable. Still, it was something to have had \"an offer\" of any kind, and my lips were hermetically seated, I had several confidants, who took care that all my acquaintance should know the comfortable fact that I had refused Mr. S I went on with increasing uncisiness a few years longer, S-. I went on with increasing uncisiness a few years longer, not seeking how to be useful, or trying to find out for what good purpose I was made. Neither was I looking for a companion who could sympathise with my better aspira- tions and elevate my whole character, for I had no right 'n views of marriage. I was simply gazing about in anxious suspense upon every unmarried man ot my acquaintance, for one who would lift me out of that disrml valley of Hu- miliation into which I found myself descending. Had I met Apollyon himself there with the question 011 his lips. I believe [ should have said Yes. At thirty-six I wore more pink ribands than ever, was seen everywhere that a respectable woman could go, won- dered why girls went into company so young, found I was growing sharp-faced and sharp-spoken, and was becoming old-maidish in the worst sense ot the word, because I was an old maid against my will. I forgot that voluntary ce- libacy never affects the temper. My sisters, be it remembered, were older than T. They too, were single. Hut they had lived more domestic lives than I, had read fewer works of fiction, had been cultiva- ting their cwn natures, and seeking to make everybody around them happy. And everybody reverenced them, and lov .d to 'oak upon their open pleasant countenances \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd I mean everybody worth pleasing\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand they were very happy.

After protracted negociation with men of different parties, and many abortive attempts to form a Ministrv of known political materials, the President has at length been compelled to construct a Ministry consisting almost wholly of persons hitherto insigni- ficant in the political world. It was not till an hour after midnight on Sunday that the arrangements were Completed, and on Monday morning a series of Presi- <Jential decrees announced the formation of a new Ministry. It will be observed; that in the whole Administra- tion there are only three .ambers of the National Assembly, and it is a singtilarvfact that they all voted for the Electoral Law of May 31st, the proposed abo- lition of which was the cause of the resignation of Louis Napoleon's last Ministers. It is said* \"that on quitting the President they expressed themselves perfectly in accord with all the points of his Mes- sage, and declared their conviction that his re-election was the surest means of saving the country from anarchy. M. de Thorigny avowed his Legitimist tendencies, but did not consider that the country was as yet, if ever it should be, fit for that form ofgoven- ment. ..0 r' The reception given to the new ministry by tne public press is not of the most favourable kind. The Dcbats affects the utmost astonishment, and observes that the situation\" is exactly the same as before that, notwithstanding the appointment of a Ministry, France \"still remains in a complete Ministerial drisis.\" The Constitutionnel remarks that although there is no Ministry, there are at leasit Ministers. The Ordre likewise professes to be amazed at the list, and attacks the Ministry with all its might. The Re- J publican journals, for the most part, treat the new Ministers as being tools of the president, ignorant of the sort of work to which they will be applied. The Presse claims confidence for the new Ministers. The general feeling is one of surprise, almost of derision, and opposition. The funds have fallen in conse- quence of the open contempt with which the organs of the majority treat the new Administration. It is, however, acknowledged that so far as the personal character of the Ministry is concerned, it offers a guarantee against revolutionary disorders, as well as against a coup d'etat. M. de Maupas, the new Pre feet of Police, has issued a proclamation, declaring that under the salutary influence of the law and the protecting segis of the President of the Republic, whose policy is invariably that of order, the tranqui- lity of Paris is assured. With regard to the alleged letter of the Prince de Joinville, it is now stated that such a document did exist, the Orleans family having made up their minds to action, previous to the resignation of the Ministers; but that when this event became known, the publica- tion of the Prince's intentions was countermanded. La Revolution having a short time since asserted that M. Carlier had purchased large estates with ill- gotten gains, an action of libel was brought by M. Carlier against that journal, the editor and manager of which has been condemned by default to eighteen months' imprisonment, and 8,000 francs fine. The French journals are filled with comments, not of a very complimentary nature, on the reception given to Kossuth in England. It is hinted that the ex Governor of Hungary is merely playing a part, with a view of condescending to the prejudices of the English people on forms of Government. The ceremony of inaugurating the equestrian statue of William the Conqueror took place at Falaise, on Sunday. There was an immense crowd both of French and English. M. Guizot made a long speech on the occasion, in which he dilated on the superiority of the victories of peace over those of wai, and espe- cially eulogized the Crystal Palace. In order to raise the character, morally and politi- cally, of dramatic literature, prizes have been offered by the Government, two of 5,000 francs, for the pro- duction of pieces combining good principles with literary merit. SPAIN. By intelligence from Madrid, of October 24, we learn that the Duke and Duchess of Montpensier were expected in the early part of November, to be present at the Queen's accouchement, which, it is anticipated, will take place at that period. The deputies were rapidly arriving in Madrid for the opening of the Cortes on the 5th of November, j The Committee on the Bill for establishing a new tariff has almost terminated its labours, and the bill is to be one of the first presented to the Chambers. No royal speech is to be delivered on the opening of the Cortes, The steamer Isabel had arrived at Cadiz with a cargo of Cuban prisoners. ITALY. The Pope's health has lately caused great uneasi- ness, and a Triduo in honour of the Apo^tbs Peter and Paul had been ordered. Prince Castelcicala is to be replaced in London by Prince Carini, the Neapolitan Minister of Madrid. Other changes have been made in the diplomatic staff of the kingdom of Naples. M. Ramirez is sent to Turin to endeavour to ameliorate the relations be- tween the Sardinian and Neapolitan Cabinets, which o\\ing to the political persecutions at Naples, and the unmeasured censures published on them \u00c2\u00a1,t Genoa and Turin, have lately been in an unpleasant state, Various representations have been made to the Cabi- net on the propriety of an amnesty being immediate- ly given, but the answer is that nothing can be done until the process of the 15th of May be terminated, and the calumnies directed against the Throne res- pecting that event be publicly exposed. In the mean time a Commission has been appointed to inquire j into the causes of the arrest of several political pri- soners in the provinces, and to select such names as are fit objects for the Royal clemency. The indul- gence lately shown to M. Peorio has been stopped by a new officer appointed to the command of the prison of L chia; M. Peorio still remains in the infirmary, but his chains have been replaced. M. Rostand, the senior partner of a firm at Marseilles, whose steamers conveyed ammunition and guns from Marseilles and Malta to Sicily during the late Sicilian revolution, having arrived in a steamer with his lady aud five children, intending to visit Naples, has not been per- mitted to land. A letter from Naples states that the Duke of Leuchtenberg is charged with an important mission. He is said to have informed the King of Naples, that in the event of fresh commotions in 1852, Russia would occupy Turkey, station corps of observation in Hungary and on the frontiers of Italy, and that, independently of her own forces, she relied on the c)- operation of the Sclavonian population of Hungary and of the Turkish Empire, The Duke also comma-1 nicated to the King a plan of the Emperor, by which he was to be placed in possession of the Pontifical dominions, in case of new arrangements. Russia is very anxious to extend the territory of her ally. It is also said that most important and secret communica- tions have been made to the King of Naples by M. Hubner, the Austrian Ambassador in Paris. Accounts from Upper Italy represent the inunda- tions of the Adige as having caused immense ravages. A whole province has been swept away by the des- tructive torrent, which had burst its dykes. The Corriere Mercantile of Genoa publishes the following on the subject of the Italian Committee:\" \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe cannot expect great impartiality from the journals devoted to Mazziui when they speak of the situation of their party. A letter of M, Joseph Ser- tori throws great light on that situation. It proves j that while the Mazzinians pretend to dictate to 25,000,000 men disposed to obey, their committee, composed of five persons, cannot agree among them- selves. It proves that Aurlio Sclicetti withdrew from the committee in consequence of serious diffetences o opinion, and not from personal motives, as inaccu-j rately asserted in the last proclamation of Mazzini. The Italian emigration in Paris, and Messrs. Manin and Montinnelli at their head, have taken part with the two secedeis. The Lombard emigration recog- nizes, in a great measure, different leaders, and never- theless the Mazzinians menance the Constitutionalists and laugh at them, saving* are s0^e unite'i party.\" This letter likewise shows the vanity of the revolutionary systems, reduced to discuss the most elementary principles. It proves that Mazsini, as well as the schismatic Sertori, merely rely on a series of abstract suppositions, namely\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdFive simultaneous insurrections in the different parts of Italy five in- surrectionary Governments subsequently united it) one a revolution against the Piedmontese system a dissolution or transformation of the Pieamontes. army; the formation of an Italian ai my the elec- tion of a Constituent Assembly, &c. All those thing- are to be achieved under the eyes of the A ustrians- that is, of an army of 120,000 mm which may be still augmented if necessary. If this be not a proof, .ve know not were to find one. We only wish to argue in the general interest of Italy, and we wib leither set nor follow the example of menaces am intolerance. i GERMANY. The plan of a central police of the Bund has been \"formularized\" and sent to the different Govein- ments, that they may give their respective represen- tatives special instructions on the subjac*. A note has been addressed by Lord Palmerston c/> \u00c2\u00bbhe Bri- tish Minister to the Germanic Confederation, in which, after replying to certain arguments founded on the occupation of Frankfort by Austrian and Prussian trodps in 1834, his Lordship adds:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The Government of Her Majesty has nothing at present to add on the subject of the military occupa- tion of Frankfort in 1834, and as the Germanic diet has not replied to the protestation which the British Cabinet recently made against the incorporation of territdry into the confederation, which was not inclu- ded by the Treaty of Vienna, 1815, in Which Great Britain took part, Her Majesty's Government does. not think proper to say anything more at present on the subject. The Government of Baden has issued an order for- bidding 17 citizens of Frankfort from entering the Baden territory upon any pretext some of the parties so proscribed formerly took an active part in the movement against the constituted authorities in Germany, others were members of the Constitutional Assembly at Frankfort' A new treaty for the international guarrante% of literary property was signed on the 21st inst., by the 9 Plenipotentiaries of two Governments of France and Hanover. An attempt has been made to assassinate the ex- j Burgomaster of Frankfort, M. Von Heyden. The motive was private revenge. AUSTRIA. The Emperor appears to have been infinitely bet- ter received in Galicia than in the Lombardo-Vene- tian kingdom. He has been much annoyed, however by the peasants presenting petitions and lodging cim} laints against the great landed proprietors. At! Lamberg, about 300 equipages accompanied the im- perial carriage to the Cathedral. After having heard high mass, the Monarch received all the different au- thorities of the city, with the sole exception of the representatives of the law faculty, which is suspected of being anything but loyal. By way of a demon- stration of disaffection, a large Austrian flag on the Sandberg, near Lcmberg, was removed during the night, and a broom, painted black and yellow, and ornamented with a well developed zopf (pigtail), as an emblem of re-action, was planted in its stead. In consequence of the discovery of a democratic conspiracy numerous arrests have been effected at Lemberg, Cracow, and other places. A Cabinet order dated from Cracow orders a reduction in the army, by delivering furloughs to a great number of men. The proposed saving in the war budget is 15 millions. The Landwher and the Hungarian and Italian Regiments are also to be reduced, as well as other branches of the army. Fifteen of the band of Passatore, the famous Italian brigand, were executed on the 14th, at Milan. Another was also condemned to death, but the penalty was commuted to twelve years' hard work in irons, in consideration of his having made revelations. Six others were condemned to different periods of imprisonment, with hard labour in irons. A letter from Vienna states that Kossuth's recep- tion in England, and the loud expression of anti-Aus- trian sentiments, has excited the greatest indignation in the Government and the Court, as well as in a great part of the army. The large powder magazine at Gneixendorf, near Krems, has been blown up. Its contents at the mo- ment were only ten hundred weight of powder, more than eight hundred weight having been removed to Vienna, on the previous day. A major, a Lieutenant, an auditor of artillery, the inspector of the magazine, and the two sentries on duty, were killed by the ex- plosion.

The Parliamentary i -e reunion or club, composed of the members of the majority, which now meets in the Rue des Pyra- mire-, assembled on Friday night to consider the proposition of M. Victor Lefranc for the revision of the electoral law of the 31st o' May. The proposi- tion, which in the Commission of Initiative had been rejected by a majority of 20 to 6, was unanimously repudiated by the Parliamentary Oub and it found no better reception in the reunion of Moderate Legitimit.ists in the Rue de Rivoli. According to the returns from the departments, the number of electors has been reduced by the new law from 9,618,000 to 6,711,000. The reduction prin cipally affects the towns. The usual religious ceremony in commemoration of the transfer of the remains of the Emperor Napoleon to France was celebrated in the Chapel of the Invalides on Sunday. The ceremony differed in no respect from that of previous years. SPAIN. M. Seijas Lozano has been appointed Minister of Finance, in the place of M. Bravo Murillo. He was to present his budget on the 14th, including the usual allocation of 14,000,000 reals to the Bank. The railroad from Madrid to Aranjuez was in- augurated on the 12th. A grand banquet was given on the occasion by the banket of Salamanca, for which an ox was roasted whole. A report has been circulated at Vittoria, that troops were to be marched to the frontiers of the three Basque provinces, preparatory to an abrogation or modification of the feuros. The emigrated Carlists are preparing an invasion of Catalonia in the spring. Count de Montemolen ha granted brevets to all his officers in foreign countries, signed by him as King of Spain and the Indies. The emigrant chieftains who maintain an active cor- respondence with him are, Cabrera, Elio, Gomez, Arrayo, Yturmande, Zavala, El Etudiante, the Cure d'Allo, Masal, and Mones. The British fleet, anchored in the roads of Barce- lona, had been compelled by a heavy gale of wind to sail away to avoid being cast ashore. So sudden was the movement, that several officers were left behind, and had to join their ships by the steam frigate Scourge, which fortunately was in port. The fleet sailed in the direction of Sardinia. ITALY. We learn from Rome, under date of the 10th, that the first hattalion of French Chasseurs is about to return to France. According to a letter in the Debats, the presence of the French army in Rome is regarded as so indispensable for the maintenance of security, that foreigners who take apartments or houses have a clause inserted, that in the event of the French army leaving Rome, their engagement shall be considered null and void. The agent of M. de Rothschild having solicited from Cardinal Antonelli the execution of certain promises in favour of the Jews, which he had formerly obtained from the Court of Rome, the Cardinal answered, that the Pontifical Government being essentially ecclesiastical, could not act as other Governments had done in the Jewish question. SWITZERLAND. The National Council is engaged in the discussion of a new electoral law, which divides the Confede- ration into 49 electoral districts, and fixes the number of Deputies at 120. The Couucil of State had adopted, by 24 votes to 16, a resolution inviting the Federal Council to renew the negociations for putting an end to the military capitulations with the Crown of Naples but the latter Council decided, by 24 votes to 16, to maintain the enrolments. GERMANY. The mseting of the Dresden Conference is finally fixed for the 23rd. They are to be held in the Bruhl Palace. The representatives of the German Powers at the Conference have been named. Austria sends Count Buol Schauenstein, Prussia Count Avenslehen, Bavaria M. Von der Pfordten, Wurtemberg M. Von Neurath, and Hesse Cassel M. Hassenpflug. M. Von Manteuffel and Prince Schwarzenberg are to be present during the early part of the proceedings. The smaller Powers are said to be highly dissatisfied with the prospect of the Conference, which they apprehend will end in Austria and.,Prussia obtaining an absolute preponderance over thorn. It is affirmed that England and France have for- mally protested against the incorporation of the whole of the Austrian provinces in the new German Federation, The Austrian and Bavarian Commissioners had arrived at Cassel on the 17t!i the troops of the two Powers twere on the point of entering the town. Genereal Peucker, the Prussian Commissioner, and Count Leiningen have paid their respects to the Elector at Welhelmsbad. Some difficulty has been created at Frankfort by the refusal of the Bavarian troops to evacuate the city, and to make room for the Austrians. Three editors of the Deutsche Zeitung have been expelled from Frankfort at twenty-four hours notice. The States of Central Germany are disarming. PRUSSIA. Addresses have been sent to Baron Manteuffel from various parts of the provinces, thanking him for the preparation of peace. He has latterly been suf- fering from illness. x. The disbanding of the Landwehr of the second class has been accomplished throughout the provinces, without difficulty. The reduction of the Landwehr of the first class has likewise been decreed. General Thumen is to be the Prussian Commis sioner for Holstein. a AUSTRIA. An imperial decree of the 12th inst. orders the disbanding of a portion of the army, agreeably to the Olmutz treaty. General Radetzky has received the Emperor's permission to return to Italy. DENMARK. The King of Denmark intends, it is said, to divorce the Countess Rasmussen, and to marry the Princess Lotfisa of Hesse. General Von der Horst has been appointed by the Stattholderate as General Willisen's successor. He is expected to take active measures of hostility against the Danes. Many of the Prussian Officers serving in the Holstein army, have left, and returned to Prussia. TURKEY. 1 he rebels at Aleppo have been completely defeated by Kerim Pasha, and, from the strength of the garrison of Aleppo, nothing more is to be feared. UNITED STATES. The latest dates from New York are to the 7th. The President's Message has arrived. It is, as usual, a lengthy document. After a dissertation on the right of nations to choose their own Governments, and a profession of principles of peace and neutrality in his foreign policy, the President passes on to his domestic policy, on which, likewise he has a prosy chapter. The formation of the Nicaragua Canal, is the first subject of real interest mentioned in the document. The negociations with Portugal are spoken of as likely to terminate in an amicable ar- rangement. The relations between the United States and the South American States, and St. Domingo, are briefly referred to. On the question of the Tariff, the President says :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd All experience has demonstrated the wisaom and policy of raising a large portion of revenue for the support of Government from duties on goods im- ported. The power to lay these duties in unquestion- able, and its chief object, of course, is to replenish the Treasury. But if, in doing this, an incidental advantage may be by encouraging the industry of our own citizens, it is our duty to avail ourselves of that advantage. A duty laid upon an article which cannot be pro- duced in this country-such as tea or coffee-adds to the cost of the article, and is chiefly or wholly paid by the consumers. But a duty laid upon an article which may he produced here, stimulates the skill and industry of our own country to produce the same article, which is brought into the market in competition with the foreign article, and the im- porter is compelled to reduce his price to that at which the domestic article can be sold, thereby throwing a part of his duty upon the producer of the foreign article. The continuance of this process creates the skill and invites the capital, which finally enables us to produce the aiticle much cheaper than it could have been procured from abroad, thereby benefitting both the producer and the consumer at home. The consequence of this is, that the artisan and the agriculturist are brought together, each affords a ready market for the produce of the other, the whole country becomes prosperous, and the ability to produce every necessary of life renders us inde- pendent in war as well as in peace. A high tariff can never be permanent. It will canse dissatisfaction and will be changed. It excludes competition, and thereby invites the investment of capital in manufactures to such excess, that when changed it brings distress, bankruptcy, and ruin upon all who have been misled by its faithless protection. What the manufacturer wants is uniformity and per- manency, that he may feel a confidence that he is not to be ruined by sudden changes. But to make a tariff uniform and permanent, it is not only necessary that the law should not be alteted, but that the duty should not fluctuate. To effect this, all duties should be specific, wherever the nature of the article is such as to admit of it. Ad valorem duties fluctuate with the price, and offer strong temptations to fraud and perjury. Specific duties, on the contrary, are equal and uni- form in all ports and at all times, and offer a strong inducement to the importer to bring the best article, as he pays no more duty upon that than upon one of inferior quality. I therefore strongly recommend a modification of the present tariff, which has pros- trated some of our most important and necessary manufactures, and that specific duties be imposed sufficient to raise the requisite revenue, making such discrimination in favour of the industrial pursuits of our couutry as to encourage home production without excluding foreign competition. It is also important that an unfortunate provision in the present tariff, which imposes a much higher duty on the raw material that enters into our manufactures than upon the un- manufactured article should be, remedied. The Message proceeds to advert to the various branches of domestic industry, to the approaching seventh census, to the means of internal communica- tion to the land laws, the position of Mexico and Texas, the public services, and departments of the Administration, in reference to all of which improve- ments are reported, or suggestions made for further improvement. In reference to the laws past last ses- sion, and the consequent excitement in some parts of the Union, the president expresses a confident, hope\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd That the American people bound together by kin- dred blood and common traditions, still cherish a paramount regard for the Union of their fathers, and that they are ready to rebuke any attempt to under- mine its integrity, to disturb the compromises on which it is based, or to resist the laws which have been enacted under its authority. Little business has been done in either House of Congress. The House of Representatives had ad- journed. In the Senate the President's Message was referred to the committees and ordered to be printed. Great uneasiness was felt at Washington, as to the policy likely to be pursued by South Carolina, and Mississippi, and other Southern States, which con- tinue to pursue an attitude of hostility towards the North. It is in contemplation to send the line of-battle ship Peasylvania with American contributions to the Great London Exhibition of 1851. SOUTH AMERICA. Accounts from Buenos Ayres, to the 12th of Octo- ber, state that the difficulty between the Argentine Confederation and Brazil was discussed in the House of Representatives, on the occasion of passing a reply to the annual Message of President Rosas, during which the conduct of the Brazilian Government was spoken of in no measured terms. CHINA. The accounts of the state of the Celestial Empire are contradictory. According to one account, the force sent by Government against the rebels had been defeated, and one or two Mandarins had been killed. Another account speaks of the Imperial troops get- ting the upper hand. At all events there is a great interruption to trade.

At the conclusion of the last grand round, when the signal for closing the garden had been issued, when the Grilop Infernal had been abandoned bv its palpitating, prespirmg, and maddened, yet exnausted votaries, a scene took place beneath the tent which puts to shame the traditions left us of the bold licentious-festivals of many of the heathen gods.

There was room for 3,000 spectators in the stands, which were well filled, and the neighbouring hills were crowded with spectators. There were only two races in which French and native horses were pitted against each other, and in each of these the former were victorious. DENMARK. I I The National Diet of Denmark has been opened by the King in person, who, in his slwcch, stated,\" that the Go- vernment is exerting its utmost endeavours to have the boun- daries of the Monarchy and the succession of the Crown definitely and securely fixed and that in these endeavours it has been met in the most friendly manner by all foreign Powers, who continue to be on the best terms of amity with the Danish nation,\" SPAIN. The Queen's Government have published in the Madrid G%zette decrees ordaining changes in the administration of the island of Cuba. They create a. Colonial Council to despatch all affairs relative to the Colonial possessions, with the exception of such as are at present. specially directed by the Ministers of Finance, War, and Marine. The President of the Council is to despatch Colonial affairs; and the Cap- tains-General of each of the colonies are to conduct the affairs of each coiouv under the control of the Council of Ministers, aided Ly special Councils. Tile ordinances profess the obieot oi increasing the rapidity of Governmental action, and neutralising the effects of geographical distance. The doubts which have lately been expressed respecting the re-assernbling of the Cortes are set at rest by a 10yal decree, in which the Cortes is decreed to meet again on the 5th of November. In a month's time, therefore, the business of the session will be resumed, and there is abundance of work for the legislature for the winter. The budget, the rail- road question, the law of the press, some measure of tariff reform, the re-organisation of the bank of San Fernando, and many other questions of UL?xj:'hmce,wiU have to be disposed of. INDIA AND CHINA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdTIIE OVERLAND MAIL. The Times express from Marseilles brings us the following i letters and accounts by the overland mail: \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The following is the letter of our correspondent at Bombay, dated September 17 tho Cashmere and the frontier continue tranquil. The troops in the tiuniab, natives as '-veil as Europeans, arc suffering most severely from fever. This is especially the ease* with those at the new frontier posts. By the setting in of the cold weather a continuous chain of these posts wiil nave been built, and the arrangements for the defence of the frontier will be complete. Dost Maiioined has succeeded in settling the disputes of the Khybcrries, who have been fighting aniougst themselves. Tae Amser still perseveres in his ag- gressive policy towards the adjacent native powers. The Kail and Sirdars of Kandahar have placed themselves under the protection of the Shall of Persia, and it is stated that 12,009 Persian troops ate at present in ileerat. The Balkh State prisoners are at Cabui, and are treated by the Ameer 'with the utmost humanity and consideration. The conquest of Balkh had greatly enriched Dost Mahomed, and added much to the ??<?t; of the A??.<ni arms. They h?-e become so self-confident as to desire to be led against the British at Peshawar, and the Ameer was lately much abused in his Durbar for opposing such a proceeding. Were Dost Mahomed 15 years younger he might achieve as great a name as any of hi/predecessors. Thenumber of military adventurers in the countries beyond the Indus is so great that a riell or suc- cessful leader may always in a few months collect as large an army as he pleases round his standard, and there is now no Power between the Indus and the Araxes that could hope to offer a successful opposition to a well-organised Affghan invasion. According to a recent return the present strength of the army of the Bengal Presidency is 167,299 fighting men, ex- clusive of all contingent and police corps; of this force men and 129 guns are in tae Punjab, and 23,40S men and gulls in the adjacent Sirhind division. Mr. Lang, the barrister, has been sentenced to two months' imprisonment in the common gaol of Calcutta, for a libel on the military character of Colonel Mactier, of the Bengal Armv. The operation of the present law relating to seamen is much complained of at Calcutta and Bombay. The Calcutta gaol is at present said to contain upwards of 10:) British sea- men, and hands cannot be shipped under \u00c2\u00a3 S a month. 11 completed the payment of half the Nizam's debt to the East India Company on the 15th of Aug. The fright that the Governor-General's threats of immedi- ately seizing his territories gave to the Nizam and his Arab mercenaries has doubtless much assisted Sooraj-ool-Moolk in the transaction; he has, however, certainly shown more vigour and tact than any of his predecessors in the Ministry. He is said, moreover, to have purchased the good offices of the Hyderabad correspondents of some of the leading Indian papers, and there is certainly a great difference in the views thty have latterly promulgated regarding Hyderabad affairs. Another outbreak-if the running-a-muck of 17 Mopiah fanatics can be so callcrl-to\u00c3\u00bck place atlvolatoor, in Malabar, on the 22ud of August, the fourth similar occurrence in nearly the same locality. These Moplahs belong to a new sect which has been founded of late years by the preaching of* mad Mussulman saint; their peculiar tenet is the ex- traordinarv virtue they attach to the act of killing an idola- ter, together yiili dying in the cause of religion, they believe insures them M immediate and peculiar reward in the next world. When a party of these fanatics meet toge- ther and resolve on taking their places amongst the sain.s, some idolater has to die within a mile 01 the place where the plan is made, aId as more cclat follows the death of a great man, some rich and high caste Hindoo is generally selected; on the present occasion, 14 of these fanatics, having devoted themselves to death, proceeded to the house of a wealthy Brahmin, whom they murdered, setting fire to his house. They then killed another Brahmin, and cut down and left for dead the head man of the village, and are stated to have sub- spquently killed two more that day. Next morning they went to another village, three miles off, where they are said to have killed the head man and seven others. Thev then stormed a high citsto Brahmin's house, well situated for de- fence. and there ensconced themselves. The outbreak com- menced on Friday, the 22nd, but no steps seem to have been taken to prevent father mischief till the 21th, though there was a stro1\\ detachment of the 30th Native Infantry. under Major Wilkinson, at Malea-Pooran, only seven miles distant. On the 21th. Major Wilkinson sent 70 of the ;mth, under Ensign Turner,'to dispose of the 11 Moplahs this detach- ment. on their arrival continued nring at the house from 2 to \u00e2\ufffd\u00a21, without effect. The Moplahs then rushed out and charged the Sepoys, who became panic struck and lied, many of them throwing away their muskets. They lost two men and a drummer. This was an exact repetition of the behaviour of the detachment of the 43rd Native Infantry in the similar instance of 1S-19, except that on that occasion the officer, I Lieutenant Wvse, (commanding the detachment of the -13rd,) lost his life. On this Major Wilkinson asked for the aid of the detachment (50 strong) of Her Majesty's U-llh, and ano- ther company of the 3:Jth, stationed at Calicut, about 4D miles distant; these troops arrived at Ivolatour on the :27tl1 of August, where they were joined by Ensign Turner's detach- ment, the whole amounting to 220 men. The Moplahs, who had increased to 17, came out to meet the troops the 94th detachment then advanced and delivered a volley without any defect; but their second discharge tilled teven of the enemy. The Moplahs then charged, and were met with a fire from the Sepoys (drawn up on the left flank of the Eu- ropeans), which staggered them, and before they could re- cover themselves the 94th had reloaded and fired. The sur- viving Mopiahs then, knife in hand, dashed in among the troops, who in a few minutes disposed of them, but not before they had killed four of the 94th and a Subadar of the 39th. The Adjutant-General of the Madras army has forwarded to officers commanding regiments a series of questions rela- tive to retirements effected by purchase, and the operation of retiring funds generally. Amongst other things, it is asked, Whether the purchase of retirement is found by ex- perience to involve individual officers in pecuniary difficulties to such an extent as to occasion their appearance before Courts of Requests r' The system of purchase adopted in the Company's regiments differs materially from that in force in the Royal army; in the latter it is always voluntary, in the former it is, practically speaking, compulsory, and the money paid tor an omcer s reiiremeui vy uiosa ueiow 1l till is all but invariably borrowed, and that at an usurious inteiest. The sums paid for the retirement of officers vary. In the Bombay Regiment of Artillery a senior captain or junior major would get from \u00c2\u00a3 :?,500 to \u00c2\u00a3 4,500 for retiring on the pension of his rank; the maximum paid to a colonel in the same regiment is \u00c2\u00a3 7,500. In the line the amount paid is less; in the cavalry about the same. The sums paid are made up by contributions according to a fixed scale from all otliccrg below the purtv retiring. If any one of these was to refuse to contribute his quota, he would be sent to Coventry, for either stopping promotion in his regiment, or for benefit- ing by a retirement purchased with his brother officers' money, without contributing his own share. The money borrowed of the banks for the purchase of steps is one of the principal causes of the pecuniary embarrassments ol Indian officers. The principle of purchasing retirements is a good one; but much more is generally paid than the retirements are worth. There appears to be little prospect of the murderer of Captain Mylne being given up by the Arab tribes, with whom he has taken refuge, and it will probably be found convenient to pocket the atfront of an outrage which could not be avenged without so considerable an expenditure of blood and treasure as a laed expedition in Arabia would in vol ve. Recent accounts from the Australian diggings report fa- vourably of their progress. Large quantities of gold have been found. There weic alieady .1,000 diggers, notwith- standing the inclemency of the season, which was mid-winter.

Having thus arrived at the mouth of the Oxus, which is said to be navigable for six hundred miles, Russia may convey her troops tiirotgli Turkistan and across Afghanistan;\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd by which route or through Khorassan, she i must find her way to Herat. Meanwhile, report states that a body of Russian troups has landed on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, and, in concert with the Persians, is now marching by the latter route upon the inheritance of Syed Khan. Of the progress of these events, the British Government cannot remain a passive spectator. They nearly concern our Indian empire, and must lead to the adoption of measures for the protection of its western frontier. The great question Is, how are the high-spirited Affghans to be dealt with, and the encroachments of Russia to be repelled. An Ambassador from Persia has within the last fortnight, arrived in London, whose mission may probably rcLtto to the present state of alius in Central Asia. CHINA. I How KOXG, Aug. 24.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe mail steamer arrived here on the 7th instant, bringing dales from England to the 21th of June. There is little of interest to report this month. We have to mention the death of Dr. Gutziaff, so well known through- out the world as a Chinese scholar and missionary. In 1831 he became interpreter to the British Superintcndency, and later received the appointment of Chinese Secretary to the British Plenipotentiary and Superintendent of Trade in this Seu, the Governor-General of Canton, is absent in the disturbed provinces. On the departure of last mail the tea market at Canton was fairly opened, and prices equal to Is. 7d. to Is. 8d. have been paid for the finest. About 105 chops have been settled. The quantity of Congou that has come down this year I from the country is nearly one-fiftu less than the previous Season. We have no later accounts from Snanghai than to the 23rd I of last month. The tea market was at that time quiet; and in silk there was little doing. Iti imports the business dune at Canton has been considc- rable, but at low prices. I AMERICA. By the arrival in the Mersey of the British and Narth American Royal mail steam ship Africa, A. Ryrie, com- mander. u-,i Sinday we receivrd advices and letters from New York to the 8th inst. The Africa made the run in 10 days 10 hours mean time. She brought 7G passengers, and i.12,277 sterling, and 4-37,712 dollars in specie on freight. The steam ship Empire City had arrived at New York from Havannah, with advices to the 2d inst., and 350,000 dollars in specie on freight. 42 Americans were sent to Spain in the brig llipa the day before the Empire City sailed. There were 13 remaining in the hospital, being all iii-it remained on the island of Cuba of the Lopez ex- j pedaion. Wo have advices from Jamaica to the 29th ult., which state that the cholera was prevailing iti that island; 11 deaths had occurred during the weeii ending the 29th. A smart shock of earthquake had been felt in Port of Spain, but no damage was dune. Antigua, St. Vincent, Grenada, i and Dominica papers furnish no news of interest. j Fiom Canada we have accounts to tiie 6th inst. The Ministry had resigned, aud Lord Elgin had been endeavour- ing to form a new Cabinet, but had not succeeded up to the ( date of our latest advices. The Governor-General, who was staying at Druinmondsviile, had sent for Mr. Morin, Speaker j of the Legislative Assembly, to form a Cabinet. In a speech made by Lord Elgin at Montreal, on his way from B iston, he referred to the possibility of his soon being released from the cares of the Governor-Generalship of British North America. His reception in the city from which his Govern- ment was driven by ?ioiencs in 18W is reported to have been on the whole respectfn!; though accounts published 4n the Ur\u00c2\u00bb;>pr Canada papers this morning state that he was greeted with hisses and groans on cuming out of the cathe- dral on Sunday. Mr. Archibald, an English contractor, has addressed a letter to Lord Elgin, offering to construct the Halifax and Quebec Railroad on candition of receiving the amount formerly offered by these proviuces\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd80,000 dollars p. year from Nova Scotia, a like sum from New Brunswick, and 120,000 dollars a year from Canada. He also oilers to construct the European and North American line on the debentures offered by New Brunswick, taking the risk of selling the balance of the shares. 34,030 emigrants had ar- rived a: Quebec this season on the 20th inst., being an in- crease of G,464 over last year's emigration to a correspond- ing date. To the same date !E7 vessels had arrived at Quebec, with an aggregate tonnage of 384,256 tons being I an increase of 73 vessels and a tonnage of 31,171 tons over the arrivals of last year to the same date. The news from California does not possess much interest. Tiie election seems to have absorbed everything. Law and order were entirely disregarded two men convicted of high- way robbery had been taken by force from the authorities and executed. The accounts from the mines continued to be very satis- factory. One vein in Miraposa, worked by a steam machine, was realizing from 609 dollars to 1,500 uollars daily. A company of four men, working a quartz mine at Mount j Ophir, were taking out on an average 3,000 dollars a fort- night; and the Canon Creek Mining Comply were realizing upwards of 5,000 per day. A very large and destructive fire had occurred at Marysvillc, California, supposed to be the work of an incendiary, by which upwards of SO buildings had been destroyed. The loss is estimated at upwards of ) 509,000 dollars. j The clipper ship Flying Cloud had made the run from New York to San Francisco in S9 days, the quickest ever accomplished. Intelligence from the city of Mexico to the 1st inst., states that disturbances had broken out in several parts of northern Mexico, and that Government had sent 3,000 men to defend Tehuantepec.

Baring, Brothers, and Co. The interest is to be at the rate of 41 per cent., the sub- scription ju ice is to be 9:3, and the instalments are to ovei- six months. On these terms the loan would yield 41.

The 'Times,' in its City article of Wednesday, speaking of this loan, which it appears has been favourably received in the market, says,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" It is understood that the railway in question has long be nearly ifnished, that the iron and rolling stock are on the ground, and that little remains except to by down the rails; so that it would uppear I probable that the undertaking is in a great measure used as a pretext, in order to obtain in a popular way supplies for exigencies which have resulted from the reeent war,\" On the subject of the loan Mr. Cobden has addressed the following letter to the Secretary of the Peace Congress :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" Another outrage is to be of- ferred to the moral sense of the civilised world.

EXTRAORDINARY RECOVERY OF LOST MONEY. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Last week a gentleman resident in the neighbour- hood of Haddington visited that town for the an- nual colleciion of his accounts. Having received about five hundred pounds, he entered a shop there, and, upon examining his money, he missed the sum of one hundred pounds. He immediately re raced his steps, arid chanced to encounter a group of chil dren in the street engaged in the examination of what seemed to be pictures; but which, upon a more narrow inspec ion, he found to be his missing notes, each of twenty pounds value.

A FARMER NOT AFRAID OF FREE TRADE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The important farm of Cessfcrd, in the county of Uoxbnrgh, was let last week to Mr. Bell, March- cleugh, at an advance of 150/. per annum, the present rent being 1,400l, Mr. Bell belongs to that industrious, enterprising, and consequently success- ful class of farmers for which Roxburghshire is so much famed. Tins class is well supported by the Duke of Roxburgh, who gives all his tenants r.ine- teen-year leases, founded upon the most liberal sys- tem of (arming; and as he does not encourage the bietdmg of vermin in the shape of game upon his estates, his tenantry have little to complain of.

Seven fine fishing smacks, whose crews numbered in the aggregate 37 men and boys, which left Hull prior lo Christmas day, in 1849, and which should have returned a fortnight aso, have not since been heard of. It is supposed that the vessel perished during the gales of ihe 27th and 28th of December. Various causes of this fearfu) toss of life and property are stated, but the most probable is that they foundered on the Le- mon-oar Sand, in consequence of the floating light d ifunt; from her moorings. The topmast of one (the Jlur:lJ) was picked up off Lows I off, and brought into Hull on Friday last. It will be seen that a public meeting is called to consider the best way of provid- ing thirteen widows and twenty-five children, such relief as their afflicted case may require Surely the benevolence of Hull will be equal to the occasion,- Hull Advertiser. RAILWAY ACCIDENT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA serious and very nearly fatal accident occurred on the East Lancashire Rail- way on Thursday se'nnight. On the train which leaves Bury for Manchester at 6 20 p.m. reaching Open Shaw Fold, it came in collision with a coal train on a siding, in consequence of the points which bad been moved to allow the coal train to shunt not havillg heen reversed. The passengers were very se- verely shaken and bruised, The last carriage but one.aso ondc)ass, was turned round and thrown across the line, and was in jeopardy of being thrown over the embankment. Mr Taylor, of Chapel Fold, was veiy much stunned and so severely cut under one of his eyes that it was feared his sight would be lost; Mr It. Owen, tailor and diaper, Manchester, had one eye and his face much bruised, besides sustaining other injuries; and a lady had one arm much injured. The parties were taken back to Bury, where a surgeon was called in and dressed their wounds, and another train was then provided to take them forwaid to Manchester. FLATTERING TESTIMONIAL.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA splendid service of silver plate, weighing between 200 and 300 oz., and other articles, have been presented to XJaptain G. Babot by the inhabitants of Jersey, as a testi- monial of their approval of his public conduct during the period of22 years that he has been employed in the command of steam-ships trading to and from the port of Southampton and the Channel Islands. The inscription on the plate, which is all of British manu facture, is to the following effect Tljis salver, together with a tea and coffee service of plate, and a yold watch, was presented to Captain George Babot by the inhabitants of Jer,ey, in token of their high estimation of his nautical ability, his unremitting zeal in the discharge of his duties, and his unvarying attention 10 the comforts of his passengers and the interests of the public while in co:nmand of the steamers Ariadne, Atalanta, and Dispatch, A.D. 1849.\" The several arti'les presented to Captain Babot on this occasion comprised a superb silver plateau, a tea and coffee service complete, and also a gold watch with cable chain and key, the Sroduce of a subscription made by the inhabitants of ersey; a smaller plateau contributed by Southamp- ton and a telescope by the inhabitants of Guernsey and were presented to him in the Chamber of Com- merce at Jersey, in the presence of the most respect- able inhabitants, in a highly flattering manner. HALVING THE CENTURY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdJust now our table is cracking and groaning under a heap of letters on both sides of the controversy aoout the completion of the first ball of the century. One correspondent illus- trates his view by proposing that we should drink thehaff of a hundred barrels of stout in as many years, and informs us that half the hundred barrels will have been drunk so soon, but only so soon, as the last pot of the fiftieth barrel shall have bean swal- lowed. Our only objection to this mode of deter- mining the question is, that he has not sent us the means of trying his experiment. We may apply similar observations to the propositions of those who ask us to smoke so rcany bundles of cigars, eat so much cheese, and wear out so many suits of clothes in half a century. The quantities of these articles are represented as given quantities, but all we can say is, that we have not received any of them. As to the .natter in dispute, we need only remark, that if the year 1800 was the first year of the century, 1801 Was the second year, 1849 the fiftieth, and the present year of grace, 1850, is the fifty-lirst. If not, then otherwise. To us the question would seem perfectly clear, but for the following communication, wh-eb, being brief, we publish in cxtenso Mr. Punch, My cousin Bridget, to my knowledge, was born on January 1, 1800. If we are now beginning the se- cond half of the century she must just have entered her fifty-first year.

I'KEACUING TO PENITENTS BY A ROMAN HCLE- SJAsTlc.-The preaching of the lialianecolesiast.es is at all events very energetic, accompanied with a violent tone of VOice occasionallv, and much gesticu- lation iu the present instance the earnest endeavours of the priest to touch the hearts of his proselytes caused 111m to become himstlf so excited, that more than once or twice he was compelled to cease alto- gether from sheer exhaustion. Once in particular when he stopped thus suddenly, and while lie stood overpowered and panting (or breath, his face stream- ing with perspiration, the singers, ever at an instant ready to pertonn their auxiliary service, poured forth a strain of melody so sudden and vivid at the critical juncture that it had the effect of inspiration. By these mea:;s the congregation \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd wrought upon by the mutual co-operation of the preacher and the singers, in a manner that probably was arranged previously, and having the appearance of being unpremeditated, Was the more effective, what with the deep impies- sion produced by eloquent preaching on one hand, and the excitement of their more delicate sympathies by the music on the other-were affected mentally to such a violent pitch, that by the time the pioces- sion arrived at the thirteenth picture, and tlie homily was concluded, their sighs and sobbing and groan became loud and general. And now the black cross being elevated in front of the sculptured lepresenta- tion of our Lord's crucifixion, and lie preacher continuing to impress on their minds mo:e fervently than ever the appeal nd misericordium, describing in the most graphic terms imaginable the sufferings of our Savioui- on the cross in minute and terrible detail while the ghastly figure, the drooping head, livid countenance, deathlike expression of features deformed by large drops of blood that trickled from the crown ot thorns upon the bosom, were displayed with con- summate artistic skill before the eyes of the spectators, a sensation ro profound was inflicted on the palpable sensss of penitents, debilitated as they were by fasting and a continuous state of nervous excitement for some previous days, that while the greater part made mani- fest their poignant grief by sobbing, groaning, and blubbering, some actually bellowed aloud for very agony. The whole room in fact was brought to a slate of uproar, which was not a little increased by one young man especially, who fell into a fit of screaming hysterics, and, in addition to his loud cries that might have alarmed the iieighbourhood, strug- gled so violently, that four strong priests with all their united strength could hardly hold him. The old priest, who had concluded I.is last homily, and having created the intense state of spiritual distur- bance above related, might well be pronounced \".functus officio,\" now immediately took his depar- ture, and piesently, a moderate degree of tranquillity being restoied, the melancholy ceremonial was brought to a termination by the performance of the !as: and most beautiful melody of all, the \"Staled Mater dolorosa,\" which was sung with exquisite pathos.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Sir George Head's Tour in Home. THE SOVEREIGNS CF EUROPE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe 'Genera Gazette of Leipsic shows that the number of Ellro- pean Sovereigns, including the Em peror of Brazil, who belongs to an European dynasty, and the two Princes of Holienzollern, and exclusive of tile semi- sovereign Prince of Monaco, at present amounts to 48, of whom 33 belong to Germany, and 3 are women. Theetdestot these crowned heads is the King ol Hanover, who is 78] years of age: of the others, 7 ate between 60 and 70, 14 between 50 and 60, 8 between 40 and 50, 9 between 30 and 40, and 5 between 20 and 30. Three have not yet attained their 20th year, viz the Emperor of Austria, the Queen of Spain, and the Prince of Waldeck (who IS only 13), The average age is 46 yeitrs and 6J 1 4 months. The sovereign who has reigned the longest time is the Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe, who has been seated on his throne, such as it is, for nearly 63 years; he is the only one whose accession dates from the last century. Three princes, the Duke of Parma, the King of Holland, and the King of Sardinia, only acceded last yerr, and, on the whole, 17 princes have only assumed the reins of government within the last ten years. Six soveieigns are celibatarians, and have always been so, viz., the Pope (compulsorily), the Emperor of Austria, the Duke of Brunswick, the Princes of Reuss Schleiz and Waldeck, and the Landgrave of 11 esse-Homberg. Four are widowers. One, the King of Denmark, has been twice divorced, and another, the Elector of Hesse, contracted a mor- ganatic marriage; a third, the Sultan of Turkey, lives in a state of polygamy. Of the 35 wives or husbands of reigning sovereigns, the eldest is the Duchess or Saxe-Weiiner, ()4: and tl.e youngest the Qu\u00c2\u00abi> of Bavaria, aged 26. Of the married sovereigns, 13 are without issue, and the other 28 have male heirs presumptive; of the latter, 6 are married. PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTION TO THE EXHIBITION OF 1351.-The executive committee have received or- ders from the royal commissioners appointed for the promotion of this exhibition, to publish a communi- cation, in which, after stating in detail the reasons for -inti annulling the contract entered into with the Messrs. Munday, they observeThis determination neces- sarily throws the whole burden of the exhibition upon voluntary contributions. The experiment is of a na- tional character, and the commissioners feel that it ought to rest for its support upon national sympathies and upon SOell liberal contributions as those sympa- thies may dictate. The amount of the funds which the public may place at the disposal of the commis- sioners must determine the extent of accommodation which can be provided for the exhibitors, and the terms on which admission can be given to the articles to be exhibited, and upon which also the public can be admitted to inspect them. The commissioners wish it to be undeistood that they are invested with unrestricted power over the application of the funds; that it is their intention to invite competition in re- spect of all branches of expenditure to which compe- tition can advantageous y be applied and that they will proceed, without delay, to establish regulations for insuring an effectual control over the expenditure, and a saMsfactory audit of the accounts. The com- missioners feel that in thus abandoning a contract, which, regarded in a pecuniary point of view alone, is undoubtedly advantageous to the public, and rest- ing the success of t.ie proposed experiment entirely upon public sympathy, they have adopted a course in harmony with the general feelings of the com- munity. It now rests with the public to determine, by the amount of their coinributions, the character of the proposed exhibition, and the extent of benefit to industry In all its branches which will result from it. It is desirahle that subscriptions for this great pur- pose be immediately commenced throughout the United Klrlgdom, and the result ascertained with the least possible delay. In the meantime the commis- sioners will be actively engaged in preparing the vari- ous measures, upon which it will be their duty to come to a final decision as soon as they are enabled definitely to ascertain the extent of the pecuniary means which will be placed at their disposal.\" A circular bus since been despatched to all the principal country towns, recommending the immediuteappomt- ment of local committees, &c. DISTRESSING CASE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd After the disposal of the usual business at Guildhall on Saturday week, a shabbily-attired woman stepped forward, and, ad- dressing Alderman Carden, said, that she was unfor- tunately in great distress and without shelter. She was authoress of Ada the Betrayed,' 'Jane Bright- well, Brentwell, and other works, but was now in the greatest distress. She was a widow, and had a daughter eighteen years of age, who was married, and living in India with her husband. Her mother was a sister of Lord de Clifford, and she had a brother living in India. She bad a work, of which she had done seven quires, and if she could get shelter in a workhouse, or anywhere, she could complete the work, and get sixty guineas for it. Iler brother, at the present time, was sheriff of Calcutta, and she had several friends in London, but she had r.ot commu- nicated with them for many years, and could not apply to them now. The applicant, who addressed the Court in a deep voice, with a strong theatrical emphasis, stated that her name was Sarah Jones, and that she had written under the name of Anna Maria Jones. She admitted, however, that herself and mother had been disposed to insanity. She said the chief cause of her present distress was a distraint for rent, and having been turned out from her abode at this inclement season. She felt Jieiself much de- graded at appearing in the streets in such attire, but had no objection to go to the workhouse for the sake of shelter. Alderman Carden asked her if she would go to the City Union if he gave her a recommenda- tion ? Having willingly assented, she was sent rhither in charge of an officer. [\" The ancestor of the noble house of Clifford, William Count of Arques and Toulouse, nearly related to the Con- queror himself, came over with William First. 'Sharpe's Peerage.'] FATAL ACCIDENT FROM FIREARMS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn Mon- day se'nnight a distiessing accident, resulting from theincaunoususe of firearms, occurred at Walsall. A youth, about fifteen or sixteen years of age, son of Mr. Swanwick, relieving officer, was on a visit with n relation, of that place, and in the morning- went out with two or three young companions to shoot birds. On their return home two of them put the:r unloaded guns in the corner of a room, and shortly afterwards the third put his gun w:th the others, bui unhappily this one was loaded. The young men were soon after | laying with the servant maid, and Swanwick, laying hold of one of the guns, and under tllP Impression that they were all unloaded, presented it at her, and said he would shoot her Thinking to frighten her, he pulled the trigger and fired, when in an instant the poor girl dropped dead at his feet. It appealed that he had taken up.the leaded gun An inquest on the body of the unfortunate deceased, before the county coro- ner, has since been held, and a verdict of \"Acci- dental Death\" returned. The family of Mr Swan- wick IS, as may be conceived, placed in great distiess by (he melancholy occurrence. THE LEVESON-STKECT MURDERS\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBricks and mortar are no more exempt from vicissitude and change than are individuals. In time are effected revolutious in the destinies of nations and of per- sons it is equally true, that in a brief period a material chsnge may be made in the character and use of a house. Ten months since, No. 20, Leve- son-street, was the scene of a s ries of the most baibaious and unprovoked murders enrolled on the recolds of cflme III this country. Never was there a de\u00c3\u00a8d committed which startled the public more, and never was public execration more prominently exhibited than towards the culprit who sc.ffeied the extreme penalty of the law for the murder of Mrs Ilenrichson and her family. Notwithstanding the excitement which that dreadful tragedy occasioned, and which more recently was renewed on the trial of it is now almost forgotten justice having been satisifed, the public mind seem to have consiglled the deed and its perpetrator to oblivion. From that oblivion we could not rescue it, wele It not that our attention has recently been called to the fact, that the house in which Mrs. Ilenriehson, her children and seivant, were murdered, is now con- verted into a !:eer-ii juse, and that morbid curiosity is likely to make the speculation a proiftable one. Titepartour of the house in which the servant and one of the children were slaughtered, is converted into a bar and lap ioom, the entrance to which is through the hall in which Mrs. Ilenriehson herself met her doom; and we presume every party in- dulging in a glass of fourpenny, is entitled to have pointed out to him the precise spot on which the murdeis took place, ifie spots of blood, &c whilst the privilege of descending to where the villain con- summated his butchery by cutting the youngest child's throat, i., limited to those who luxuriate in the higher priced and more palatable description o! malt liquor. However this may be, .lie lircl)t-iefor IS likely for some time to reap a good harvest. It is said that some time previous to the murders taking place, Captain Ilenriehson was anxious to let the house, but could not find a tenant willing to pay the rent for which he was liable, with the ex- ception of a person wllo wallted to convert it into a beerhouse. An arrangement was entered into be- tween Captain Ilenriehson and this party, subject to the approbation of the owner of the house, who refused to permit the house being transformed into a beer shop, and the negotiation terminated, Captain Ilenriehson retaining possession of the house. If this statement be correct, we have another instance of a party refusing from choice what they are after- wards compelled to accept from necessity.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLiver- pool Times. SHOCKING MURDER IN CORSICA.-The follow- ingaiedetaits relative to a melancholy catastrophe which has just taken place in Corsica. Bazani, a re- fugee, was ordered to quit the French territory in twenty four hours but M. Pietri, to whom he had been recommended, interfered in his behalf, and by giving his guarantee for his good conduct, he had the order cancelled. In September last, M. Pietri, who was about to I, ave home, recommended DaziuII to the attention of his daughter, Madame Malaspina, who kept his house, and be was for several months treated completely ES one of the family. Bazani be came enamoured of her, and he had the effrontery to avow his feelings to her. At this outrage on her cha- racter as a wife and a mother, Madame Malaspina reproached him with his ingratitude in entertaining the idea of dishonouring a family from whom he had received suca warm hospitality. Bazani, however, would not be repulsed, and renewed his declaration in warmer terms. Madame Malaspina then became enraged, spat in his face, and went and informed her fatherandhusbandofwhathadoccurred. M. Pietri and M. Malaspina decided on sending him away, furnishing him with the expenses of his journey. Bazani left the place, but returned on the following day, and managed to get into the room of Madame Malaspina, where he concealed himself. Madame Malaspina not making her appearance at the usual dinner hour, the servants went up to call her, but not finding her in her own room, went through the ad- joining ones, which were also empty. On coming to that which had been occupied by Bazani, they found the door fastened on the inside, and, on breaking it open, saw the bodies of Madame Malaspina and Bazani both dead. It ts supposed that the assassin had seized the lady on her entering her room and dragged her into his own, where he committed the savage murder, by discharging a pistol at her head, and stabbing her in several places with a poignard, afterwards using the same weapons against himself. The body of Madame Malaspina was on the bed, arid the assassin lying beside her, with the rings which he had taken from his victim on his fingers. Madame Malaspina was the grand niece of General Paoli.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Gulignunis 'Messenger. THE LEPEROS OF MEXICO.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA Knife-Duel at Glluna,rato.- The leperos, we need hardly explain, are the pest of Mexico\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdragged, dirty, often dis- gustmg with disease or deformity, born idlers, beg- gars, and thieves\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin the latter capacity so especially skilful, that Mr. Wise inclines to the belief that a man, standing open mouthed in a crowd of them, could hardly escape having the gold picked from his molars They reaped a rich harvest at the time of the American invasion. It was a case of nos amis les ennemis.\" The conquerors were preyed upon by the conquered. Iron bars were unavailing against the cunning rogues. One evening some expert praciitioner contrived to entice a valuable pair of Pistols. clothing, and other articles, from my table in the centre of a large apartment, by Introducing a pole and hook through the iron grille of the window; and the same night my friend Molinero was robbed of his bed-clothes, while sleeping, by the same enterprising method.\" By a strange tolerance, these leperos are admitted everywhere; and in the splendid coffee and gambling houses of the large cities they are found rubbing their filthy rags against officers' embroideries and the fine broadcloth of wealthy burgesses. The lepero's chief pastimes are thieving, sleeping, and gambling for copper coins. By way of variety, he occasionally gets up a mortal combat. We think the following the best acconnt of a knife-duel we ever read A lepero was purchasing a bit of chocolate it fell in the dirt, when another, probably thinking it a lawful prize, seized it and took a large bite where- upon the lawful owner swung a mass of heavy steel spurs attached to his wrist, jingling with some force on the offender's head. In a second down dropped the spurs, and serapas (a kind of blanket), were wound round the left arms. With low deep curses and Hashing eyes, their knives gleamed in the light; the spectators cleared a ring, and to work they, went.

Blood spurted from an ugly wound in the spur- vender's throat; but at the same moment his short weapon sealed the doom of his antagonist, and he lay upon the ground, as lifeless as the bloody steel that struck him. I glanced at the wounds after the affair had terminated, and found that the klllfe had been plunged twice directly in the region of the heart. There was no effort or attempt made by the beholders to arrest th parties and the survivor caught up his spurs, a bystander quickly folded a handtome ker- chief to his neck, and, threading the crowd, he was soon out of sight. The corpse was laid upon a liquor-stand, with a delf platter upon the breast. Wises Wanderings. From astatement put forth by the trustees of the fund for the reln-l of the distressed clergy in Ireland, it appears that, while the fund is nearly exhausted, the sufferings of the clergy, during the presenf sea- son, are likely to be at least as iiitei,se as thereto which tile, were exposed last year. The appeal is supported by the publication of several cases of ex- treme distress. A prelate once asked on old woman how many sacraments there were ? To which question she re- plied by saying there were but two. But (replied the bishop) there is marriage; what prevents your regarding so holy, delightful, and happy a state, as one of the sacraments V' Ah ah Sir (said the old woman,) if it is so very good, what is the leason you have never partaken of it?\" A WINDSOR CONVERSATION FROM MADAME D'ARBLAY'S DIARY. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd A general silence was just threaiening us when Madame la Fete suddenly, in her broken English, exclaimed she had been having a great dispute whether Mrs. Delany was born in this century or the last: the Colonel (Goldsworth), S)rprispdoutoftusg)umness,ca))edout,\"Inthe last century, ma'am What do you mean by that ? Would you make the good lady to be a hundred years old ?\" She explained herself so extrenily ill, that not a creature was brought over to her opinion though it was afterwards proved that she was right, and that the year 1700, in which Mis. Delanv was born, belonged to the ast century. Mr. Fisher and Mr. Blomberg both said that the year 1700 must be the first of the present century. Madame la Fete delared that she had made it clearly beloog to the last, and Mr. Turbulent was as well convinced of it as herself. \"1700 belong to 1600,\" cried the Col., indignantly. \"Why, then, I suppose Friday be- longs to Thursday, and Wednesday to Tuesday! n I y Bless us here's such a set of new doctrines, a man won't know soon whether he's alive now, or was alive the last age?\" Madame la Fete now attempted a fuller explanation, but was so confused in her terms and so much at a loss (or words, that though per- fectly right, the Colonel looked at her as if he thought her half mail. \"0 dear, yes, ma'am! yes,\" cried lie, bowing with much submission, J daresay it's all very right\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdonly it's a little new\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat's a11\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd1700 makes 1600.

Madame D'Arblay's Diary, vol. iii, p, 192. OLD ROTHSCHILD\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAxieties of a .Million are.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd It was not an unvaried sunshine with this gentleman. There were periods when this gigantic capital seemed likely to be scattered to the four quarters of the globe. He had also other sources of apprehension. Threats of murder were not unfrequent. On one occasion he was waited on by a stranger, who informed him that a plot had been formed to take his life that the loans which he had made Austria, and his connexion with governmellts adverse to the liberties of Europe marked him for assassination and that the mode by which he was to lose his life was arranged. But though Rothschild smiled outwardly at those and simdar threats, they said who knew him best, that his mind wxs always troubled by these remem- brances, and that they haunted him at moments when he would willingly have forgotten them. Occa- sionally his fears took a ludicrous form. Two tall moustachioed men were once shown into his count- ing-house. Mr. Rothschild bowed the visitors bowed; and their hands wandered first in one pocket and then in another. Totheauxiouseyeof the millionaire, they assumed the form of persons searching for deadly weapons. No time seemed al. towedforthounh) a ledger, without a moment's warn- ing was bulled at the intruders and in a paroxysm of fear he called for assistance to drive out two cus- tomers, wlfo were only feeling in their pockets for letters of introduction. There is no doubt that he dreaded assassination greatly. \"You must be a happy man, Mr Rothschild,\" said a gentleman who was sharing the hospitality of his splendid home, as he glanced at the superb apartments of the mansion. \"Ilappy \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd I happy!\" was the reply. \"hat! happy, when just its you are going to dire, vou have a letter placed in your hand, saying, Ifyou do not send 500/ I will blow your bralls out?' IlappN, I I happy!\" And that the fact that he frequently slept with loaded pistols by Ins side is an indirect evidence of a constant excitement on the subject.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Characters of the Slock Exchange. INCIDENTS ON A RETREAT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA good dinner was prepared for us, a delicious leg of mutton being par- ticularly acceptable. There was no want of good wine and bread; and thus, on the edge of the wildest tumult, we enjoyed ourselves in the greatest tranquil- lity like a man sitting on the rock on which a light- house stands, who looks out upon the raging billows ows of the stormy sea, and sees, here and there, a ship abandoned to its fury. But a truly pathetic family- scene awaited us in this hospitable mansion. The son, a handsome young man, carried away by the general feelings of the day, had already served for some time with the national troops in Pans, and had distinguised himself there. But when the Prussians entered the country, and the emigrants arrived, in proud reliance on certain victory, the parents, confi- dent also, implored their son to give up his situation, which must now be odious to him, und return home and fight for the good cause. The son, against his inclination, from respect for his parents, comes back just at the moment when the Prussians, Austrians, and emigrants are retreating: lie hastens, in a state of desperation, through the crowd to his father's house. What is he to do now ? and how are they to receive him ? Joy tillis them at seeing him again, grief at losing him the moment afterwmds: distrac- tion also from the fear of losing both house and home in such a slorm. Attached, as most young men were, to the new order of things, he is compelled to join a party wh:ch he abhors, and no sooner has he done this than he sees he party overwhelmed in ruin. Having run away from Paris, he knows very well that he is already inscribed iu the list of traitors, and condemned to death and no-v, n an instant, he is to be banished from his country, and driven from his father's house. The paients, who would have loaded him with caresses, are themselves obliged to drive him forth, and he, shedding tears of joy at see- ing them again, knows not how to tear himself away; their embraces are reproaches and the parting,which takes place before our eyes, is terrible. All this oc- curred in the entrance-hall, just before the door of our room. Scarcely had it become quiet again, and the paients retired weeping, when another scene, almcst more wonderful and striking, occurred, in which we were ourselves interested, and which caused u; some embarrassment, but over which, although touching enough, we could not in the end help smil- ing. Several of the country people, men, women nnd children, rushed into our room, and threw them- selves, yelling and screaming, at my feet. With the burning eloquence with which their grief and afflic- tion inspired them, they complained that the soldiers were driving away their cattle; they appeared like farmers on some large estate. If I should only look out of the window, I should see them that instant driven past,-tbe Prussians had seized them,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand they begged me to help them, and order them to be restored. On this I went to the window, to consider what I should do, when the dexterous hussar placed \"mse)f behind me and said: \"I beg your pardon, but I have given you out as the brother-in-law of the King of Prussia, as a means of getting a hearty re- ception and good treatment. The peasants, indeed, ought not to have come in but only refer the good people to me, with some kind words, and make it appear that you are convinced by my proposals.\" What was to be done ? Surprised and displeased, I collected myself, and seemed to reflect for a mo- ment. Is then, I said to myself, cunning and deceit allowable in war? Whoever permits himself to be served by rogues is in danger of being led astray by them. A useless and shameful piece of scandal is here to be avoided and like the physician who, in desperate cases, still holds out hope, and writes his prescriptions, I dismissed the good people, more in the way of pantomine than otherwise then whispered to myself, to quiet my conscience, if the true heir to the throne at Sivry was unable to promise the horse to the people demanding it, that surely the spurious brother-in law of the King may well be excused for seeking to rid himself of these unfortunates with some well-turned excuse. -Goethe's Campaign in France in 1792.", "word": "6", "description": "\u2026 stabbing her in several places with a poignard, afterwards using the same weapons against himself.

It is clear that a purely Man- chester cabinet, however it might represent the wishes of the people, could not work in harmony with the present electoral system. At the same time no government can expect to stand that does not to a large extent, win their support, and the Manchester men should now come boldly forward and ad- the people's rights in a manner that will give a trium- phant retort to the taunts of their opponents-that they are not i.!r<je-heartfd enough for the wants of the time, and dis- tin^uished. rather for the keen close sight of the tradesman than for the wide far sight of the statesman. The conduct of the Thelites enables us to form no judgment of what they will settle down to. With political principles that micht ?o on, they have religious whims that wish to go brick.

Al- though this useful work has reached its twelfth number, the novelty of its plan is still startling. Public questions are debated with a boldness, a tact, and in a style of literary ex- cellence equal to the quarterlies. And the striking fact of the publication is that the pro and con of each question handled is done in an equally skilful manner. In the Edi- tor's own department there are some valuable instructions for young debaters, and indeed for all who seek to methodise and -:se knowledge, and to discipline their minds.

Its fame, however, assures us that we may safely introduce it to the principality., In form and getting up it bears a close rosemblance to Chambers's Journal.

But it di.fers from Chambers in that it has with each part a steel engraved portrait, of some noted man. That in the present number-is a likeness of-Thomas Carlyle, and there is also a pen and ink portrait\" of the celebrated writer. An inter- esting series of sketches of papers by George Gilfillan on The French Revolutionists,\" appears also to be in progress. That on Napoleon\" in the present number, can be fairly commended as being full of original thought and novel views.

On Monday afternoon week Charles Dickens, the author of Copperfield,\" presided at the annual dinner of the subscribers to the General Theatri- cal Fund. On the same night his infant daughter, Dora, died suddenly; which event rendered necessary the postponement of the acting (at Devonshire-house, in presence of the Queen) of Sir Bulwer Lytton's new play, written for the purpose of acquiring a pecuniary foundation for a new benevolent literary institution. Wordsworth, too, had a Dora, who died not long before himself, and concerning whom the Rev. Dr. Wordsworth, in his memoir of his uncle, just published, has the following anecdote On or about this dav, Mrs. Wordsworth, with a view of letting him know what the opinion of his medical officer was concerning his case, said gently to him, William, you are going to Dora.' He made no reply at the time, and the words seemed to have passed unheeded; indeed, it was not certain that they had been even heard. More than twenty-four hours afterwards one of his nieces came into the room, and was drawing aside the curtain of his chamber, and then, as if awaking from a quiet sleep, he said, Is that Dora ?' I THE MEETING OF THE HtJSBAXDS. At Colchester, a singular circumstance occurred lately at the funeral of a woman who died of dropsy, at the hospital. Twelve years ago, she was wedded to one Joseph Manning, a carpenter at Marks Tey, but soon after quitted the bridal hearth and set out upon her adventures in the world. A period elapsed, and the tidings reached the deserted one that she was re-married to a mason named Coates, with whom she was living comfortably at Kelvedon. There Manning found her, but her second love being stronger than her first, he failed to coax ner back to his own fare-side, and they met no more, nor did Tumour ever bring him the history of her whereabout. Wandering, however, a few days since in Col- chests r, on an idle excursion, he beheld a funeral cortege issue from the hospital gate. He followed it listlessly to the churchyard of St. Mary-at-the-Walls, and when the corpse had been lowered to the arms of its mother earth, he care- lessly scanned the inscription on the coffin lid, and, lo it was his own wife. The two husbands of one wife had been present at her funeral. one of them unconsciously; and No. 1 having tendered his thanks to No. 2 for burying her so respectably, they adjourned together to a neighbouring inn, and joined in praising alternately the good qualities of the deceased, and of the fare before them.-Essex Herald. PENS TURNED QCAKER. His friends at the vice-regal court were greatly distressed at this untoward event. The earl wrote off to the admiral to inform him of his s?n's danger, stating the bare facts just as they had come to his knowledge. The family were thunder- struck. The father especially was seriously annoyed; he thought the boy's conduct not only mad, but what was far worse in that libertine age\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdridiculous. The world was beginning to laugh at him and his family: he could bear- it no longer. He wrote in peremptory terms, calling him to London. Wil- liam obeyed without a word of expostulation. At the first interview between father and son nothing was said on the subject which both had so much at heart. The admiral scru- tinised the youth with searching eyes, and as he observed no change in his costume, nor in his manner any of that formal stiffness which he thought the only distinction of the abhorred sect, he felt reassured. His son was still dressed like a gen- tleman; he wore lace and ruflfes, plume and rapier; the graceful curls of the cavalier still fell in natural clusters about his neck and shoulders-he began to hope that his noble cor- respondent had erred in his friendly haste; but a few days served to dissipate this illusion. He was first struck with the circumstance that his son omitted to uncover in the presence of his elders and superiors; and with somewhat of indignation and impatience in his tone, demanded an interview and an explanation. William frankly owned that he was now a Quaker. The admiral laughed at the idea, and treating it as a passing fancy, tried to reason him out of it. But hemistook his strength. The boy was the better theologian, and the more thorough master of all the weapons of controversy. He then fell back on his own leading motives. A Quaker! Why the Quakers abjured worldly titles-and he expected to be made a peer. Had the boy turned Independent, Anabaptist \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdanything but Quaker\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhe might have reconciled it to his conscience. But he had made himself one of a sect remark- able only for absurdities which would close on him every door in tuumjr uiiu-ifs. men tilere was tnat question ot tne nat. Was he to believe that his own son would refuse to uncover in his presence ? The thing was quite rebellious and unna. tural. And to crown all\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhow would he behave himself at court ? Would he wear his hat in the royal presence ? Wil- liam paused. He asked an hour to consider his answer, and withdrew to his own chamber. This enraged the admiral more than ever. What; a son of his could hesitate at such a question Why this was a question of breeding, not of con- science. Every child uncovered to his father-every subject to his sovereign.

After a time spent in solitude and prayer, the young man re- turned to his father with the result of his meditation-a re- fusal. The indignant admiral turned him out of doors.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Hepicorth Dixon's Biography of Penn. A POPE CHARGED \"WITH WITCHCRAFT. It is not necessary to enter into a detailed history of the quarrel between the French monarch, Philippe le Bel, and the Pope, Boniface. VII. It originated in the determination of the King to check in his own dominions the power and insolence of the Church, and the ambitious pretensions of the see of Rome. In 1303, Philippe's ministers and agents, having collected pretended evidence in Italy, boldly accused Boniface of heresy and sorcery, and the King e?Icd a council at Paris to hear witnesses and pronounce judgment. The Pope resisted, and refused to acknowledge a council not called by himself; but the insults and outrages to which he was ex- posed proved too much for him, and lie died the same year, in the midst of these vindictive proceedings. His enemies spread abroad a report, that in his last moments he had confessed his league with the demon, and that his death was attended with \"so much thunder and tempest, with dragons flying in the air and vomiting lfames, and such lightning and other prodigies, that the people of Rome believed that the whole city was going to be swallowed up in the abyss.\" His suc- cessor, Benedict XI., undertook to defend his memory but he died in the first year ofhis pontificate (in 1304), it was said by poison, and the holy see remained vacant during eleven months. In the middle of June, 1305, a Frenchman, the Archbishop of Bordeaux, was elected to the papal chair under the ti.tle of Clement V. It was understood that Clement was raiise,d to the papacy in a great measure by the King's in- that he should allow of the proceedings against Boniface, which were to make his memory infamous. Preparations were again made to carry on the trial of Boniface, but the King's necessities compelled him to seek other boons of the supreme Pontiff, in consideration of which he agreed to drop the prosecution, and at last, in 1312, Boniface was declared in the Council of Vienna innocent of all the offences with which he had been charged. Whatever may have been Boniface's faults, to screen the reputation of a Pope was to save the character of the Church. If we may place any faith at all in the witnesses who are adduced against him, Boniface was at bottom a free-thinker, who concealed under the mitre the spirit of mockery which afterwards shone forth in his countryman Rabelais, and that in moments of relaxation, especially among those with whom he was familiar, he was in the habit of speaking in bold-even in cynical-language, of things which the Church regarded as sacred. Persons were brought forward who deposed to having heard expressions from the lips of the Pope, which, if not invented or exaggera- ted, savour ot inttdelily, and even of atheism, Other persons deposed that it was commonly reported in Italy, that Boni- face had communication with demons, to whom he offered his worship, whom he bound to his service by neeromancy, and by whose agencies he acted. They said further, that he had been heard to hold ennversations with spirits in the night; that he had a certain idol.\" in which a diabolical spirit\"- was enclosed, whom he was in the habit of consulting while others said that he had a demon enclosed in a ring' which he wore on his finger. The witnesses in general spoke of these reports only as things which they had heard but one, a friar, brother Bernard. Je Sorano, deposed, that when Boni- face was a cardinal, and held the office of notary to Nicholas III. he lay with the papal army before the castle of Pnriano, and he (brother Bernard) was sent to receive the surrender of the castle. He returned with, the Cardinal to Viterbo, where he was lodged in the palace. Late one night, as he and the Cardinal's chamberlain were looking out of the window ofthe room he occupied, they saw Benedict of Gaeta (which was Bouiface's name before liA was made Pope,) enter a garden adjoining the palace, alone, and in a mysterious manner He madjUlcucle oiuhe ground with a sword, and placed himself m the middle, having wjthhim a cock, and a fife in an earthen pot Cin quadarn ollr terr(l). Having seated himself in the middle of the circle, he killed the .c and. threw its blood in the fire, from which smoke immediately issued white Benedict read in ,a ,certain-boijk, tq conjure demons. Pre- sently brother Bernard heard a great noise (rumorem mag- num), and was much terrified. Then he could 14,istingui.s the voice of some one saying, \"Give us the share,\" upon which Benedict took the cook, threw it out of the garden, and walked awav without tittering- a word. Though he met several persons on his way;lie spoke to nobody, put proceeded im- mediately to a chamber near that of brother Bernard, and shut himself tip. Bernard declared that, though he knew there was nobody iu the room with the Cardinal, he not only heard him all night talking, but he could distinctly perceive a strange voice answering him. This voice, of course, was that of a demon.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Wright's Narratives of Sorcery and Magic, WORDSWORTH'S ACCOUNT OF HIS BOYHOOD.

I My father,\" says Admiral Lord St. Vincent, had a very large family, with very limited means. He gave me, at start- ing in life, \u00c2\u00a320, and that was all he ever gave me. After I had been a considerable time at the station, I drew for E20 more, but the bill came back protested. I was mortified at this rebuke, and made a promise, which I have ever kept, that I would never draw another bill without a certainty of its being paid. 1 immediately changed my mode of living, quitted my mess, lived alone, and took up with the ship's allowance, which I found amply sufficient; washed and mended my old clothes, and made a pair of trousers out of the ticking of my bed and having by these means, saved as much money as redeemed my honour, I took up my bill, and from that time to this I have lived within my means.\" I THE STORY OF A LIFE. I am not a little diverted by taking on somewhat about the irksome monotony and confinement of a fortnight's spell at the desk and figure work, and seeming to thyself like a piece of machinery in consequence. I have really been so unfeeling as to have a hearty laugh at the whole affair. Why, man, I took my seat on the identical stool I now occupy at the desk, to the wood of which I have well nigh grown, in the third month of the year 1810 and there l. have sat for three-and- thirty blessed years, beside the odd eight months, without one month's respite in all that time. I believe I once had a fortnight; and once in about two years, or better, I get a week but all my absences put together would not make the odd eight months. I often wonder that my health has stood this sedentary probation as it nas, and mat my mental ia- culties have survived three-and-thirty years of putting down figures in three rows, casting them up, and carrying them for- ward ad infinitum. Nor is this all; for during that time, I x, r d a(l itt think I have put forward some half-dozen volumes of verse; to say nothing of scores and scores of odd bits of verse con- tributed to annuals, periodicals, albums, and what not; and a correspondence implying a hundred times the writing of all these put together where is the wonder that, ,on the verge of sixty, I am somewhat of a premature old man,, with odds and ends of infirmities and ailments about me, which at times are a trial to the spirits and a weariness to the flesh ? But all the grumbling in the world would not mend the mat- ter, or help me, so I rub and drive on as well as I can.-Ber- newel Barton. SOME OF THE SOCIAL STATISTICS OF LONDON. I In the midst of the 10,000 acres of bricks and mortar that according to the latest computation, compose the modern Babylon, there is a beautiful supply of everything that can be required by its inhabitants. There are 796 board and lodging houses, and for those who dine and breakfast abroad there is a choice of 330 dining-rooms and 883 coffee-shops besides, for the more affluent, who do not patronise the clubs, 398 hotels and taverns. There are 126 brewers and 66 dis- tillers, and the channels through which their productions flow are amazingly numerous, including 4,340 publicans, 802 beer-shop-keepers, 88 ale and porter agents, and 770 wine- merchants, besides 20 makers of British wines. For the more intellectual wants there are 858 private academies, 132 district and parochial schools, 62 British and Foreign, 17 National, and 50 collegiate institutions for granting degrees. Literature is disseminated by 452 printers, 780 publishers, and booksellers, and 285 newsvendors. To those who are curious in names it may be worth while to observe that the not uncommon patronymic of Smith\" is borne by no less than 1,412 shopkeepers alone. The annual consumption is estimated at 190,000 bullocks, 776,000 sheep, 250,000 lambs, 270.000 pigs, 120,000 tons of fish, 11,000 tons of butter, 13,000 tons of cheese, 12,000,000 quarters of wheat, besides vast quantities of flour imported, 10,000,000 gallons of milk, 65,000 pipes of wine, 2,000,000 gallons of spirits, 2,000,000 barrels of ale and porter, and 3,000,000 tons of coal.-Adams's Pocket London Guide. I PULQUE HOW MADE. We passed through the centre of a district in which the maguey, or large American aloe, is extensively cultivated for the manufacture of pulque. Pulque is the common drink of all Mexicans, and answers to our beer, though more intoxica- t,\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdrr All u-Vin nnw I7pt accustomed to the smell and taste like it much. and it is even said to become necessary to people after they have used it for many years. When the republic was first established, many old Spaniards threatened with expulsion petitioned the National Assembly to allow them to remain in Mexico; the groundwork of the petition being, that they had been so long accustomed to drink pulque (not procurable in Spain), that their lives would be endangered if they left it off. The manner of making this drink is as fol- lows :When the aloe is just on the point of throwing up its huge stem from its coronet of leaves, deep amidst which its broad basis had been for some time forming, the farmer or gardener scoops out the whole pith, leaving the outer rind, and thus making, inside the circle of leaves, a bowl-like cavity about two feet deep and eighteen inches wide, according to the size of the plant. This cavity is soon filled with the sap which should have gone to nourish the stalk, and as it flows is removed several times daily for some months, or as long as the tap yields. A portion of this juice (called honey water, ae-uamiel) is set apart to ferment and act as a sort of leaven or yeast for the rest. This is called madre-pulque, the mother ofplIlque and when completely prepared (which it is in about a fortnight), a small portion of it is added to the skins or tubs containing the fresh aguamiel, and sets it fermenting in a day or so. A large plant is said to yiel-I from ten to fifteen pints daily, and this for months Others vary the process by putting a small quantity of mescal into the cavity in the plant, to mix with the sap as it flows iii and this seems to answer very well. This process of milking the aloes, is, as might be ex- pected, a fatal one to the plant; but before it dies it always throws out shoots, which keep up the stock. The fermen- tation is usually conducted in skins, and as soon as this is over the pulque is fit for drinking. To strangers both the taste and smell are horrible\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdsomething of the style of rotten eggs\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd but one soon gets accustomed to the flavour. The fresh sap, or aguamiel, is often drunk unprepared, but is too humble a tipple to be generally patronised. These aloes are often of immense size. The common leaves are eight or ten feet in length, more than a foot in width, and thick in proportion. The stem often shoots up to twenty or thirty feet more, and is as thick as a man's body.- Trip to Mexico, 1849-50. A GLASGOW RADICAL'S VIEWS OF THE UNITED STATES, UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE, &Ci Letter from W. S. Brown, in the Glasgow Saturday Post: \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" Boston, Feb. 15, 1851.-1 have looked at the political institutions of America, of course, with a favourable eye. Here universal suffrage is in full operation and, of course, I have looked for it producing some of those fruits predicated _<\u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 v.IIO, III UO l< ,VIIC\\ X somewhat disappointed. No doubt the working classes are better off here than in Britain. As a whole, they get higher wages. They live better, dress better, and have a better chance getting on in the world. A mechanic here may look forward to having a little house of his own, with a piece of land and that, too, with some degree of probability. But I question much if these advantages should be entirely set down to the possession of the suffrage. It helps; but we must also take into account the facts that land is plenty, labour in great demand; and the country new. But, on the whole, I am disappointed much in the working men of Ame- rica. They seem to me as much behind their institutions as the better class of British working men are in advance of theirs. One feature will give you an idea. They work long, long hours-from eleven to fifteen hours a day is quite com- mon. And they do not exercise an influence over elections at all commensurate with their number and importance. They let the monied aristocracy do pretty much as they have a mind to. And although the press is free in these northern states\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdfreer than anywhere else, in the wor,d-they do not take advantage of it any more ttian tsritisn workmen do, who have to pass through a five-toll road to it. The young men I meet, as a whole, disgust me The plated rings they wear on their fingers would almost hold a ship's cable, and Brum*, mageri' jewelleryin any quantity. As tradesmen, too, they are miserable at everything which requires manual skill. Three-fourths of the compositors I have met with would not be admitted for an hour into an English printing office. They do not serve more than a year or two's apprenticeship, then run away, and set up as journeymen. Smiths, cabinet makers, &c., all have the same character. In articles made by ma- chinery they do very well but not where manual skill is re- quired. Another reason why Americans are so deficient in most mechanical trades is the Yankee spirit of cheapness. You will have heard before this reaches you of the disaster which happened to the Atlantic steamer. Her owners were too proud and national to get their vessels fitted up with en- gines at Glasgow. Had they done so, they would have beat the Cunard line, for their build is more ship shape, But both engines gave way; and it was only this morning we heard of her safe arrival at Cork, after everybody had given her up for OSt. I I HOW MAJOR EDWARDES LOST THE USE OF HIS RIGHT HAND. I was in the very act of writing, when a horseman rode in L from the picket, and reported that Moolraj's army were cross- ing the bridge in the same order that they had done before, and were coming on- again to give us battle. Astouhded, but unable to disbelieve, I beat to arms, summoned the chief officers, ordered the line to be turned out at once, and was holding a hurried conference with Lake and Cortlandt in my tent, while all three of us were jumping into boots, or buck- ling on swords and pistols, when a second horseman from the picket entered, I had just loaded my pistols, and went on cramming them into my-belt while listening to the man's re- port The hammer of one got entangled but without look- ing to see what was the matter, I seized the barrel in my right hand and pulled the pistol into its place. A loud re- port, a short pang, and I had lost the use of my right hand for life The ball had passed through the palm, and lodged in the floor at my loot. But there was no time for regrets. The line had t'frncd out, and Lake rushed to the fiijld to take my duty and his own. Nobly he would have done 'both but I must own it was a great relief to me to hear that as our line advanced the enemy retreated again behind the city walls, and proved to have been on'ly a party of cavalry sent out to reconnoitre our position.

In the absence of Sir Digby Mackworth, Bart., President of the Branch Society, Mr. Cordes, jun., was called upon to preside. After some preliminary observations by the Chairman, and the or- dinary routine business, the meeting was addressed by a rev. gentleman, whose name we did not catch; by the Rev. H. Allen, (the deputation), the Rev. W. Allen, the Rev. John Barfield, the Rev. T. Gillman, the Rev. Mr. Griffiths, and Mr. Turner. The resolutions passed expressed satisfaction at the success of the society's operations, and a conviction that L the growing influence of Catholicism in this country, might be most efficiently repelled by the free circulation of the Scriptures. A vote of thanks was passed to the Mayor for the use of the Ha 1, and after singing the doxology, the meeting separated-the usual collection being made at the door. BURGESSES' MEETING.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Last evening a meeting of the burgesses was held at the police-court, T. B. Batchefor, Esq., in the chair; when a committee was formed, to confer with the town-council on Monday next, in respect to the sale of a portion of the Marshes, required for the Newport and Ponty- pool Railway. There was some humour caused at the close of the meeting, by a discussion as to whether the office of \"bellman\" should remain in the hands of the man who at present bears the bell,\" or be transferred to one familiarly known by the cognomen of Bill the Burgess,\" who had offi- ciated during the day, in convening the meeting, with a cracked bell, of very small dimensions. The question of appointment was adjourned sine die. THE ROYAL AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe notice, with pleasure and admiration, the highly successful meeting which this important body of our countrymen have had this year. The provincial visitors went from London, via railway, in thousands, and the gathering of England's fine yeomanry, mingled with the aristocracy of the land, on the first, day, was one of the most gratifying spectacles that could be wit- nessed by the lovers of peace and national progress. As many of our readers know, the implement department was trans- ferred to the Crystal Palace; but so large was the increase in other departments, that about the usual space seemed to be taken at the show. The great variety of breeds was particularly noticed on this occasion. Many of our foreign friends, who were present, expressed their astonishment at, and admiration of, the growth and symmetry of the fine animals exhibited. MONMOUTHSHIRE RAILWAY AND CANAL COMPANY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd A meeting of freighters using the roads of the above company, was held on Wednesday last, at the King's Head Hotel, in this town, to take into consideration the present serious diffi- culties of the conflicting interests,\" with a view to devise some means for alleviating, if not entirely removing, the same. We understand the meeting was most numerously attended, all the large iron and coal freighters being present. As the meeting was of a strictly private nature, we cannot offer a report of the same, but we understand, from good authority, that Messrs. Homfray, T. Brown, Cartwright, and J. Brown, were deputed to proceed to London yesterday, for the pur- pose of conferring with the committee of the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company, aud submitting such moderate and reasonable terms for their consideration, as are likely to prove satisfactory, and thus, as we sincerely desire, put an end to the long war in which the respective parties have been engaged, and the establishment, of a lasting and prosperous peace. WESTERN VALLEYS RAILWAY TIME.-A correspondent calls attention to a matter which, he thinks, renuires altera- tion. He states that in the arrangement of Sunday trains on theWesternValleys Railway, due attention has not been paid to the time of the Sunday trains on the South W ales Railway. Thus, for instance, the time for starting at Court-y-Bella is exactly two minutes, on Sunday evenings, before the South Wales arrives at Newport. Our correspondent suggests, that this should be so altered, as to give parties who might come up from Swansea, or other places on the line, to New- port, an opportunity of going up the Western Valleys Line the same evening; and as a quarter of an hour might be occupied in walking from one station to the other, he recom- mends that the South Wales time of arrival being 7-32, p.m., the Western Valleys time of departure should be 7.47,. We have no doubt an improvement, so easily effected as this may be, will readily be made. REGISTER REGISTER! REGISTER -Our friends will do well to remember that, in order to entitle their names to re- main on the list of parliamentary electors, it is necessary that all poor rates and assessed taxes due up to the 5th of January last. should be paid on or before to-morrow, Saturday the 19th, (the 20th, the last day for legal payment, happening to be Sunday). As a General Election is sure to take place upon the lists now being prepared, it will be seen that the impor- tance of attention to these particulars cannot be too strongly insisted on. It should be borne in mind, that of the assessed taxes, those for the quarter ending December are due in March, even if not demanded by the respective collectors, of whom our friends would do well at once to inquire whether any rates or taxes are yet unpaid. TEMPLE OF PEACE ANNIVERSARY.-This lodge of Odd- fellows, meeting at the Bush Inn, Commercial-street, celebrated their anniversary on Monday last, at the Town- hall, the Mayor having kindly consented to its use for the occasion. the brothers, who mustered in large numbers, were honoured by the presence of R. J. Blewitt, Esq., the member for the boroughs, who is one of the order and several strangers were also present. The hon. member presided and Mr. Toogood, auctioneer, filled the vice chair. The dinner was much superior to ordinary society\" spreads,\" and re- flected credit on Mr. and Mrs. Baker, of the Bush the wines and spirits were unexceptionable; and the dessert, which had been kindly presented by Mr. Blewitt, comprised melons, grapes, &c\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd of the richest flavour. The gaily-decorated hall was well filled by the company who appeared greatly to enjoy the festival; the speeches of the chairman, in proposing the loyal toasts, &c., together with those of the officers of the lodge, in respect to the routine business of the order, and votes of thanks to the chairman, vice-chairman, &c., were loudly applauded; the singing was excellent; and Pollock's quadrille band played in their very best style. In fine, when the companv separated at eleven o'clock, all expressed them- selves delighted with the happy feast. PRINCE OF WALES ANNIVERSARY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn Monday last, the members of the Prince of Wales Lodge of Oddfellows.M.U., mot at their lodge-room, to celebrate their eighth anniversary, when a very happy party, about seventy, sat down to a good dinner, that reflected much additional credit on the catering abilities of the worthy host and hostess. P. G. Wm. Martin was called to the chair, and P. G. Thomas Essery filled the vice chair. After the usual loyal toasts had been given, some very able remarks were made by the vice chairman, on the nature and advantages of Oddfellowship. Messrs. Pittman, Williams, and Bagstock, enlivened the company with some select pieces of music. The evening concluded with dancing, which was kept up to an early hour, when the company separated, highly delighted with the day's enjoyment. FEMALE FRIENDLY SOCIETY. -The members of a society certified under this designation, and meeting at the Market Boat Inn, Stow-hill, celebrated their anniversary on Monday last, on which occasion, in marching from the club-house to St. Paul's Church, headed by the male secretary, they pre- sented a very respectable appearance. Their enjoyment of the capital diuner provided by that well-known caterer, Mrs. Brain, proved that the softer sex, when united in the discus- sion of a club-feast, are not far behind \"male societies,\" in the manner in which they attend to \"creature-comforts.\" FRIENDS' BROTHERLY BENEFIT SOCIETY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe members of this society held their anniversary on Monday last, at Mr. Palmer's porter-house, when a numerous company sat down to an excellent and substantial dinner, provided in the worthy hostess's well-known style. After dinner the song and jest went merrily round, and the company separated at an early hour, highly gratified with their evening's entertainment. HARVEST GATHERING OF TEACHERS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe time for com- mencing the harvest gathering of teachers, for the Diocese of Llandaff, in the National School-room, in this town, has been altered from the 25th of August, to the 19th of that month.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd See advertisement. ST. SWITHIN'S DAY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdTuesday last was closed by heavy showers of rain, which came just in time to start same wise people off on the old notion, that the forty ensuing days would be wet 'uns ST. BRIDE'S TEA PARTY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMany visitors from Newport, who set out early in the afternoon tor this gala, with nigh hopes and sunny smiles, came back in the evening, wet, weary, and dispirited. Notwithstanding the storm, however, considerable enjoyment was realised at St. Brides. A BACKWARD MOVEMENT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLast Monday, while the trap\" of Mr. Bateson, the celebrated ginger-beer manu- facturer, was standing near the canal, at the screw packet wharf, Old Tom,\" the sagacious horse, finding the weather oppressively warm, or being desirous of filling the empty bottles behind him with canal water,made a retrograde move- ment, tilted the cart and contents over, and of course followed them also into the water. Old Tom\" scarcely knew what to make of his venturous plunge at first; but hearing his master's voice, shouting in loud alarm, was recalled to active consciousness, and in a short time was got safely ashore again,-the damage done amounting to a few pounds only. INTENDED EXCURSION.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe handsome little Bristol screw-boat, the Wave, was expected here on Tuesday last, with an excursion party from Weston but adverse weather caused a disappointment, and the Wave didn't come. SHIPBUILDING.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThere is rapid progress being made w'J-h a fine ship at the building-yard of Mr. Willmett, which will be about equal in size, tonnage, &c to the last launched, the Isca. SHIPPING. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd There is at present a fine display of large ships in our dock, among which are some that attract great obser- vation, from the fact that considerable numbers of persons from this neighbourhood are about to emigrate to the United States in them. INCREASE OF PILOTS AND BOATS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt was deemed advis- able some time back, by the Commissioners of Piloting of this port, to increase the number of pilots, which was done by ap- pointing three, Mr. Matthias, Mr. W. Jones, and Mr. Durne- ford, who are having first-rate crafts built, by Mr. Williams, boat-builder, Docks. Mr. Anstice, the owner of the winning- boat, at our last regatta, feeling a little dissatisfied with her sailing qualities, has, it is sail, determined on having a new one built, which, we hope, will prove as successful as the Ganymede. THE NEWPORT PACKHTs.-The Bristol Dock Committee of the town-council, a,-e prudently extending the facilities at Bathurst Basin, for the accommodation of the steam-boats of the two companies, by providing a new and capacious landing- place for goods and passengers on the north bank of the New Cut. RUNNING HIM UF.-On Friday morning last, when a vessel was coming-to, off the Newport Dock, the crew were lowering the anchor, by a tackle from the rigging, and acci- dentally let it slip, when the end of the rope caught one of the crew by the neck, and slung him up several feet from the deck. His messmates, seeing his perilous situation, ran up the rigging, and cut down poor Jack, and saved him from an ignominious death, which he must otherwise have suffered. an ignominious death, which he must otherwise have suffered. SHIPWRECK AND Loss OF LIFE.-On Sunday morning last, the Joseph Anderson, a schooner of 135 tons burthen, while on her voyage from this port to Bristol, laden with coals, struck on the Culver sands, a few miles to the south of the Steep Holmes, and went down. The accident was unfor- tunately attended with fatal results. The captain, the mate, and three of the crew were drowned two others were saved, being picked up by the Ganyifiede boat off Weston-super- Mare. The names of the deceased are Richard Holler, cap- tain, who has left a wife and eipht children: John Tope, mate; Wm. Sheppard, and Francis Drake, (of Plymouth,) and a boy, name unknown. SHIPWRECK.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdRio Janeiro, June 10.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Aust barque, Bosidar, of Trieste, Newport to this port, got on the rocks at Fort Loge, 8th June, and went to pieces. The pinnace, stern, boat, masts, and deck of the vessel, have come on shore. The boat is marked W. Wilson, London,\" and is supposed to have belonged to the William Wilson, Shields to Aden, which foundered off the island of Trinidad on the 3rd inst. FRENCH CATTLE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe perceive that a lot of fine French cattle, just imported by Messrs. Simon and Pickford, are to be sold by public auction next week. -See advertisement. CONCERT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe understand, from an advertisement in another column, that Mr. Evans, an artiste of some celebrity, will give a concert at the Assembly Room of the Crown Hotel, this evening; and there can be but little doubt that it will be both fashionably and numerously attended. EXTRAORDINARY ESCAPE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd A most remarkable escape from being crushed to death, occurred at the Newport station of the South Wales Railway yesterday. While a lady was crossing over the rails, from one side of the station to the other, she suddenly fell, and the engine was at that moment approaching fast. The engineer, with the most prompt energy, forced down the break, and reversed the engine, being thus able to avoid killing the still prostrate lady, at the moment of most imminent risk. The impropriety of the lady, in attempt- ing to cross at such a moment, and the cool and skilful exertions of the engineer to avoid a frightful catastrophe, are alike matters of general comment. ST. MELLON'S FAIR.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe have been requested to notice that this place is to be favoured with a fair, on Tuesday the 29th, for the sale of cattle, &c., by the special appointment of the principal residents in the neighbourhood.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdSee adver- tisement. APPROACHING ECLIPSE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAn eclipse of the sun will occur on Monday, the 28th of this month. In London about 82-100ths of the sun's disc will be covered by the moon but the obscurity is not likely to be very great. The gloom is usually of a peculiar nature, sensibly different to a cloudpH sky- In the metropolis the eclipse will commence at four minutes past two, p.m., and will end at a quarter past fo The middle or greater phase will be at twelve mimUps three, when the sun will appear as a narrow crescent \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 the convex border towards the horizon. avinS By a typographical error, the date \u00c2\u00ab\u00e2\ufffd\u00a2'Wednesday th\u00c2\u00ab 1^1, \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd instead of Monday, the 14th, appeared last w'\u00c2\u00abot \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 advertisement of flour and potatoes for sale in Newport*1", "word": "3", "description": "\u2026 cargo,s.

They are highly impor tant, and, we regret to add, very uiis-itisi,icloiy-ijot to say disastrous. For the last six months Sir Harry Smith his been waiting for reinforcements sufficient to enable him to execute a grand concerted movement on the mountain fastnesses of he Caffres in the Ama- tola mountains, and thus it was assumed to put a bril- liallt and victorious end to the war. Uetween the 2Gdi and 30th of June Sn Hairy Smith and General Somerset carried out this operation by concerted movements with great success, so far as ilielilinle(iiite result was concerned. The execution of the manoeu- vre was as follows: On the 24th of June, the three I great divisions of the army converged towaids the southern side of the Kafir fastnesses. III order to in- tercept any reireat of the enemy III a nOrlhern direc- tion, Captain Tylden's detachment was brought down from Whittlesea, where they had been employed in protecting the northern frontier against the Tarn bookies. By the 30tll the three divisions succeeded in clambering through he Amatolas, at the expense of six killed and fifteen wounded I)-,t when they had got to the plain they found the coast clear- ilie enemy was flown. It turned out thai ihe moment Cap am Tylden had descended from Whittlesea on the Ama- tolas, the Tambooktes desce ded from Whittlesea; whereupon Captain Tylden retreated, and so did the Kafirs. Even the anticipated booty was not forth- coming. Only 2,200 head of cattle and fifty horses were found by our troops in the v,lole mountain d s- tr.ct; for the enemy had sent off the remainder of the herds some time previously to a pi.ice of secuiitv. On the other band, the Kafirs and their Hottentot allies, dislodged from the Amatolas, spread them- selves in bands of marauders over the colony, and did an amount of mischief, compared with which all thai had previously been suffered ts trivial. A large tracr of country in the interior of the colony has been de- vastated, the houses brirnt, and the inhabitants ex- pelled or slain and, in revenge for the 2.200 head of cattle captured by Sir Ila. ry Smith in the Amatol is, no less than 20,000 merino sheep, 3,000 head 01 ca'- tie, and 300 horses have been swept away by the bar- barian invader. Tire history ()f tire -noiiiii succeedin,, the storming of the Amatolas is made up of incidents mostly disastrous, but none of them having any pact- fic significance except an overture towards a sort of protective neutrality from the hypocritical and treach- erous chief Krelli.

{"ocr": "THE REV. WALTER DAVIES. S I it, -'I'I) ePei-ils;il of the article in the last 'Herald* upon Walter Davie\" and Welsh Literature,\" has given me much pleasure. But there is a mistake in it with regard to his age, when he entered Oxford, which I am able to rectify. It is stated in the article to which I refer,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand indeed the same statement was made in a biographical sketch of the Rev. Walter Davies, which appeared in your paper a short time ago,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat his age when he entered Oxford was twenty-one. But the truth is that he was much older in fact he was about thirty. I have now in my possession a copy of a letter from him to a clerical friend of his, \u00c3\u00b9a red\" Llaufechan, Dec. 23, 1791,\" in which he says, I have the pleasure to inform you, with the deepest sense of gratitude, that an humble heart can conceive, that I was matriculated a member of St. Alban's Hall, on Wednesday, the 14th instant.\" It appears that he was born in the year 1761. The Her. Walter Davies was certainly an extraor- dinary man, and an honour to his native country. If he was possessed of any talent in a greater degree than another, it was, in my opinion,strong,masculine sense. He was, no doubt, a good poet, and remark- ably well informed upon most subjects; but he was emphatically a man of strong common fense. And in proof this assertion I would refer to his \"Traethawd ar Ryddid,\" to his Biographical Account of William Jones, of Llanerful,\" and to his General View of the Agriculture of North Wales,\" &c. Mr. Davies had many difficulties to contend with in the early part of his life but he persevered, and was enabled to overcome them gloriously. I cannot re- frain from relating an anecdote which I heard some years ago respecting his first poetical composition. Who his poetical instructor was, I do not at this mo- ment recollect: but whoever he was, young Walter was induced to put his first poem in his hands, and desired his tutor to put a pin through every mistake in the composition. In due time, the paper was returned, but in a very different state from what it was at first; \"it was as full of lioles,so 3Ir. Davies used to relate the nneodotp. T am told-\" it naa as full of holes as a cabbage net is.\" In forming a just opinion of the merits of Mr. Davies as a literary character, we ought not to forget the difficulties with which he had to contend in early life. Every man's performances,\" says Dr. Johnson, to be rightly estimated, must be compared with the state of the age in which he lived and with his own particular opportunities.\" \"The palaces of Peru or Mexico were certainly mean and incommodious habi- tations, if compared to the houses of European mo- narchs; yet who could forbear to view them with astonishment, who remembered that they were built without the use of iron.\" May Wales before long have a greater number than ever of such men to boast of and to honour, as the late venerable Walter Davies April 10, 1550. BLEIDDIAN. Snt, In the lierald' of last Saturday is a letter signed \"Dyn Pren,\" containing a few remarks on the government examinations. I must confess that, after having carefully perused the letter, I am at a loss to discover the drift of its author. Whether he is opposed entirely to all state grants for educational purposes, or whether he merely objects to the plan as set forth by the committee of council, the writer does not explicitly state. I presume, however, that it is with the plan only that he finds fault; for as a member of the An- glican church, he cannot consistently repudiate state aid. To talk of government grants as a bribe\" to the schoolmasters, comes with an exceedingly bad grace from a member of that church. What motive has government for offering the \"bribe?\" If the schoolmaster be bribed, the bishops and clergy of the Anglican church\" were bribed long before him and the same system of bribery still prevails to an enor- mous extent. It is pretty manifest, however, that what Dyn Pren\" terms a bribe\" would not be con- sidered a bribe,\" provided he had the privilege of receiving it or if he really believed it to be such, he would experience but little difficulty in smothering conscience and pocketing the\"bribe.\" A comparison is instituted between the bribe\" offered to the Roman Catholic Priesthood of Ireland, and that offered to the English schoolmaster, and a holy indignation is excited in the breast of \"Dyn Pre\", at the thought of the Roman Catholic priest receiving a larger bribe\" than himself. Ambitious, impious man Does he aspire to an equal honour with the clergy ? Here is the secret oause of\" Dyn Pren's\" spleen. The bribe is not sufficiently large to tempt his cupidity. Just before giving expression to his indignation at the endowment of the Romish priest- hood, \"Dyn Pren\" had written very sentimentally on the love which a teacher should feel for his work in- dependently of any filthy lucre.\" His sentimentaliam leads him so fur as to make him forget all considera- tions of a pecuniary nature, whereas in the succeeding paragraph he cOlIlplains bitterly that the \"bribe\" offered to schoolmasters, (and to Dyn Pren\" among the rest), is not equal to that of the Irish priesthood\" now, 1 believe there are hundreds of masters whose love tor their work is quite as strong as Dyn Pren's\": but who also hold that if they are to qualify them- selves for their office by long and laborious study, they are entitled to something like a fair remuneration for their services. Whether schoolmasters as a body re- ceive a fair remuneration, is a question into which I need not enter here. I wish not to judge the motives by which Dyn Pren\" was actuated in writing his letter to school- masters but from the tone of that letter one mi\u00c2\u00b0-ht reasonably infer that Dyn Pren\" is a disappointed man. Perhaps Dyn Pren\" is not very well qualified to undergo an examination. In such a case he is not permitted to take the \"bribe;\" for it is not offered him. Perhaps \"Dyn Pren\" has been examined and failed. In this case also he ia not permitted to take the bribe,\" for it is not offered him. If this be not the cause of Dyn Pren's\" complaint, what is the cause If the government plan is incomplete (which I by no means deny) who does not \u00c2\u00abDyn Pren\" propound a better ? I am sure the friends 0f education would feel deeply indebted to him. The committee of council might, perhaps, give their sanc- to it, and thus be the means of rescuing Dyn Pren\" from obscurity, and placing him in a position where his talents would be appreciated. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, April 17 tb, 1850. p. SIR,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdI observe, in your last Herald,' a letter from Mr. Gilbertson, of Bala, in which he states that at the instance of Mr. Lloyd he has been obliged to enter into recognizances to keep the peace for twelve months. I appeal to the publio, or rather to the small circle of the public, who will condescend to read his and my communication, whether upon his own showing, and admissions, the magistrates were not bound to require him to find sureties, I perfectly agree with you that it would have been better (to use your own words) to have aliowed the healing influence of silence and of time to cure the wounds inflicted in this case; but in justice to Mr. Lloyd, my partner, and myself, I trust you will in- sert this letter, although I must offer you some apology for the unavoidable length of it. As to Mr. Lloyd's refusal to pay his tithe\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdsuch a refusal was perfectly warranted under circumstances which I will not trouble the public with. Mr. Gilbertson says\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" Mr. Lloyd, with much warmth, in a mat/ common to people of the lowest class, denied my stutement.\" He does not pollute his pen, ink, and paper, by repeating the plebian language, but soars into the region of ariatocrhcy himself, and tells us that he said\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" Mr. Lloyd, consider yourself horsewhipped by me\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdyou know where my residence is, I am at any time ready to render you any re para- tion you may require!\" Why should Mr. Lloyd con- aider himself horsewhipped, if Mr. Gilbertson had not either wielded his writing pen in a threatening attitude over Mr. Lloyd's head, or threatened to horsewhip him. Mr. Gilbertson invited Mr. Lloyd to call him out to fight a duel, not now so fashionable a mode of settling differences as it used to be. Surely if this is all the provocation he gave Mr. JJoyd, there was no good reason why the latter should accept his invitation. Mr. Gilbertson knew well however that Mr. Lloyd's habits and pursuits, his general disposition and moral feelings, his position in society as a magis- trate of the county, and his general state of health, would, and did make his feelings revolt against the sanguinary conflict which he pretended to court. Mr. Gilbertson has had numerous opportunities of in- dulging in this mode of chivalrous warfare if he were seriously inclined for such an encounter, and this is a pitiable endeavour on his part to send his name down to posterity as a hero. As to the low language which Mr. Gilbertson alleges Mr. Lloyd to have used, I may well leave it to the re- spective friends of these gentlemen to say who is the most nnjait at foul tongue. Mr. Gilbertson denies having made use of any threat of any sort, either in words or attitude, but the words he admits having used, import a previous threat or a personal attach, and looking at the general tendency of the language he admits having used, the magistrates would have 110 alternative but to bind liiin in recogni- zances to keep the peace, even admitting what lie states himself to be the correct version of the story. Let me remind Mr. Gilbertson, and I trust he will benefit by the information, that under a very old statute, any person, \"not being of good fume,\" which Lord Coke construed to mean all person suspected of an intention to break the peace\" might be required to find sureties for good behaviour, to lite intent that the people be not by such rioters or rebels troubled or endangered.\" Mr. Gilbertson insinuates that Mr. Lloyd swore before the magistrates, as dictated to by his professional advisers, but no one who knows Mr. Lloyd will believe that he would be guilty of the heinous crime of per- jury, even if it could be believed that he could meet with profedsional men daringly wicked enough to advise him to do so. Mr. Gilbertson says he was informed by the Grand Jury or some of them (no one else could give the in- formation, and the jury ough t not to have done so, as they are sworn not to divulge any matter that comes before them) that he and his witnesses were not dis- believed. Possibly they were not, and indeed as one of the witnesses was a parson, it is to be hoped they were not. There was no inconsistency in the Grand Jury ignoring the bill, if they were believed. Mr. G. nevertheless might have derived his information from a juryman (whom, perhaps, he had indelicately pumped) and who might have been anxious to screen himself from violating an oath which he had so re- cently taken, and also to soothe Mr. G.'s irritability, consequent on his defeat. Mr. Gilbertson says he would hail with delight an tations of action against him for a criminal prosecution. This isall bombast. If Mr. Lloyd acts wisely he will leave Mr. G. in his present unenviable position. Mr. Gilbertson denies that there were loud manifes- tations feeling, except by Mr. Lloyd's two attornies. This statement can be proved to be untrue by scores of persons. The manifestation of feeling did not arise in con- sequence of Mr. Lloyd's acquittal, and that by a jury who could only hear the evidence against him, but on account of the disgust naturally felt by a sympathising public at the unjustifiable and unwarrantable proceed- ings adopted by Mr. Gilbertson to gratify his own personal mal-gnity. I have thought it necessary to say thus much in answer to Mr. Gilbertson's letter. I have personally no ill feeling whatever towards liiiii-iiis character is a contradictory mixture of virtue and vice-lie oan from the impulse of the moment be <r(Mierou\u00c2\u00abm\u00c2\u00abd eh ari- (aoje, and ;n the following moment he could outrage the laws of heaven, the laws of humanity, and the laws of Christian charity-he could, and possibly will, endeavour to hurry Mr. Lloyd (who has a nervous and shattered constitution) to his last home, by persecution within the reach of all persons and I believe he could afterwards, in the utmost sincerity, assume a penitential posture, and indulge in lachrymal wailings over the prostrate body of his victim. I promise you I shall not trouble you on this matter again, and remain, Sir, yours obediently, TIIQ. LLOYD ROYLE. Llanfyllin, ICth April, 1850. Sm,-Being one of the two attorneys alluded to in Mr. Gilbertson s letter that appeared in your last paper, you will oblige me by allowing space in your next to the following reply :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd It may appear strange to your numerous readers, as well as it does to myself, how Mr. Gilbertson is so well informed as to conversations I might have had with Mr. Lloyd previous to the summary proceedings of which Mr. Gilbertson complains. How Mr. Gilbert- son obtained his information I know not, unless he is as great a conjuror as the wizard of the north; or, perchance, one of those persons possessed of clair- voyance, in either of which cases the mode in which his information was obtained will not appear so strange as I at first considered it. As I do not wish to mix up other parties in this unpleasant business, I will content myself by flatly and positively denying the truth of Mr. Gilbertson's ill- sinuations so far as regards myself, and I defy that luminary, talented as he Js, to prove that I in any way shewed the least demonstration of feeling in court, although I as well as a great many more did so out of court in the course of the evening. Mr. Gilbertson says he has had great difficulty in getting the tithes from Mr. Lloyd. This I do not believe, as I have seen Mr. Lloyd's vouchers for the last two years, and they bear date in accordance with the notice sent by Mr. Gilbertson of the tithes being due. Upon the last occasion, which led to this unpleasant transaction, it is not to be wondered at that Mr. Lloyd refused to pay the tithes when your readers are informed of the following circumstances, viz.:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn Mr. Lloyd's re- ceiving the usual notice from Mr. Gilbertson, or the tithes being due, he compared it with the previous half year's receipt and found a difference of about a pound, which, of course, can not be the case in the same year, if the accounts are properly kept. Mr. Lloyd, on several occasions, asked Mr. Gilbertson to explain the difference, but could get no satisfactory answer, where- upon he waited upon the Rector, and asked him to accompany him (Mr. Lloyd) to Mr. Giioertson's office, and get the difference explained but instead cf which, Mr. Lloyd was threatened to be horsewhipped by Mr. Gilbertson at the office. Mr. Lloyd having received three demands from Mr. Gilbertson within a few days of each other, and all three varying in amount, it was natural, that he should ask for an explanation. Facts are stubborn things, and if Mr. Gilbertson should doubt what I say, I will endeavour to get Mr. Lloyd to allow me to publish them. Mr. Lloyd did pay the tithes, not to avoid a distress,but to prevent a quarrel with tile Hector with whom he always has been, and still is, upon the most friendly terms. Mr. Gilbertson says, he is much wronged by the proceedings. I am, among others, not inclined to agree in the opinion and I beg to coincide with the remark you very properly inserted at the end of Mr. Gilbertson's letter. Mr. Gilbertson also says, that it is not to be supposed that a professional man would dare to take so serious a step us I have taken in this matter, &c.\" As to Mr. Gilbertson's daring courage, I do not doubt it, as I gee or {^r of his brawls almost daily. Indeed, I should not be suprised if he should (after the expiration of his recognizance) insert a challenge in Bell s, Life' to contest for the championship of the hght weights. And I will add that I have no doubt that the expectation of the allow- ance of a liberal bill of costs, coupled with a revengeful feeling, wis the real object at heart with him at our late assizes. Trusting you will excuse my encroaching on the columns of your valuable journal, and that I shall have no more cause to trespass upon them on this subject, I am, bir, your humble servant, ,0\u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 WILLIAM WILLIAMS.

III such circumstances, or in any circum- stances, a Welshman of foursewoutd do his dllty: bd I can well imagine the tumult of feeling that would sweiiiiis breast, if the captive or the vanquished called for quarter in the language of his native hills. It is difficult to speak of your country, for the language of common-place description sounds like flattery or ex- aggeration. I li;ivi, se,:zi it f,oni its Ilaii to B\"t-sliebi, that is, from Bangor to Swansea, llIld from Offa's Dvke across the St.-a. Its scenery unites the sublime with the beautiful and even to one whose taste is formed from a more tame and domestic model, it is like a f'airv land. Of its hospitality, I dare not trust myself to apeak; for, both the languages of Briton and Saxon would fail me, in describing the true-hearted kindness which I nave a thousand times gratefully experienced. Of its weather, \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd hum\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdha\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe less said the better, sueh a day as til is. It is a gTeat consolation, however, that when a man is wet to the skin he can't be much worse. On its roads I have bad numerous adventures. It is said that \"accidents will happen in the best rivulated families; but I have never met with more tll:11J three upsets in one day, in a Welsh mail coach. And when a man is hung-ry, what better amusement canhewish for than catching a Welsh rabbit by the tail. Or when he is thirsty let him do, as I intend to do to-day, quaff to the health of our orthy presi- dent and the people of the Principality generally, a reaming cup of CKVW (In. It is said that there have been three g-reat migratory families among mankind, which for the sake of distinction we may call the an- cient, the medieval, and the modern. The ancient family is the Celtic one, at whose hislory the unthink- it),- man smiles as though it were fabulous, but which the antiquary or historan receives with becoming re- spect. I at once confess my inability to decide the curious question whether it was Welsh or Hebrewthat A'lam and Eve spoke in Paradise it is suiffcient that from the time when Ur of the Cha'dees received its name, the children of Tower can be traced west- ward over Germany, Gaul, and Spain, till they are bounded by the tides of the ocean. The Homans are the progressive family of the middle ag-es of history; and we trace to this hour the proofs of their power alld distiction In the various wide countries over which their eagles flew. The Anglo-Saxons are the pro- gressive people of modern times the youngest brnneh of the family we admit, but your blood relations still. Wherever energy or migration are necessary, you will not find them lagging in the rear; where the battle of civilisation and human progress is fought, you will see them in the front. Before the rays of their varied intelligence the frozen barriers of prejudice and lIa- tionality are thawed, and the hearts of thousands of varied tribes and interests are fused into one. Why should this be so abroad, and we not feel the effects of it in our common country and our common home. It requires but little knowledge of plants to show that the same soil in which leeks flourish, produces excel- lent rosebuds, and is at the same timo productive of thistles and shamrocks. Long- may they flourish to- gether, an emblem of the brotherhood and peace of the various sections of our great community. You speuk of the beauties of your language, let me tell you of the importance of mine. I address you in the lan- g-uage which embodies the thougllts of a hundred mil- lions of the human race, and which, like an electric spark, is communicating itself to many millions more, it is undeniable that in our own islands, the accents of other tongues are gradually hushed where it is heard. In America, red man and white man alike contend with it in vain it is heard from the equator to the poIe, from the Gulf of Mexico to Hudson's Bay. In Asia it is spreading over India, and by the end of the century Hindoo and Mussulman will speak it freely. In Africa it is penetrating northward from the Cape, and will soon be bound only by the central desert. It is circling round the island of New lIol- burl, awl answering to us from many isles of the Southern ocean. And further still, the men of other climes, savages or sages as the case may be, use the language of England in speaking of places still more remote and inaccessible, where the spirit of our mari- time and inland discoveries had previously urged them, and where our own union lfag had been planted. Lono- may we and those who succeed us repose in its shade in harmony and peace. You rejoice in the antiquity and beauty of your language, and I feel equal honour, pride, and pleasure as I contemplate the influence and extent of my own (loud applause).

COLYDDAN. P. Ellis Eyton, Esq., (Clwyedog,) in rising to ad- dress the meeting said, that accustomed although he had been that one day ill his life to public speaking, lie did nut the less kei his utter inability to addrtss them in a manner worthy of the occasion but that he want language to express the feel- ings of his heart, he trusted that thosu feelings were warm and sincere in behalf of his country, and that whenever weighed in the scale, in that respect lie should not be found wanting. Discussing the originof the Bardic ]\",vtuti went oil to say, that it was lost in the mist of ages, hut whether Eisfedd- fodau fur the encouragement of poetry and literature, were held prior to the fifteenth century, seemed uncer- tain. No doubt many present had read of the bards and minstrels of yore, following their warriors to the battle field, and cheering on their ranks to victory, or sustaining the drooping .spirits of the vanquished, and reviving them with the brightest hope. the great inf-hu-nce they possessed, Edward 1., the builder of the very castle in which this Eisteddfod was held, was said to have massacred the bards, but he (Mr. Eyton,) would compliment his audience upon doj: a muchnobicrand more Christian-ke deed in attending tiiat meeting, not to massacre, but to encourage bards, and min.-trels, am! to award theui that praise whi'h was to them the breath of life.\" Respecting Ess- teddfo.lau, much had been said both for and against. The speaker that preceded him had spoken of their advantages, and he would mention some of the object- lions raised to them by their enemies. Itwassaid, that the '1 language was a great hindrance to commerce, that it had proved a wearying millstone a round the neck of many a struggling and talented Welshman. The most reasonable answer that he could make to this was\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\"Teach a Welshman as much Eng- lish as you please, and (I venture to predict that a knowledge of Welsh will be no hindrance to his learn- ing' English)\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdgo even further, and let English, if it will, supersede the Welsh but for Heaven's sake, let our beautiful language die (if it must die,) a natural death, and do not murder it while it is still living. But I for one must say, that it can never die, for you may sooner stop the winds that are sweeping over our heads, or still the waves that are beating ag-aiust the time-worn towers of this ancient castle, before you can uproot a language so deeply implanted in the affections of a whole nation of people I would therefore pro- pose with three cheers \"ws byd i'r iaith Gyinraeg.\" (Ine proposal was received with three hearty cheers, and extemporaneous englynion from several of the hards). The speaker continued to show the benefit likely to ensue from Eisteddfodau, as calculated to inspire iivtaste for poetry, the\" art divine\" \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdto awaken II lore for music, the humanising influence of which was felt in every clime, besides cultivating a knowledge of history and geneial literature. In addition to this they encouraged useful cottage manufactures from beehives and workmanship in wood, down to the lowest though not least useful woollen stockings. They iiad had models of vessels the best adapted for navigation, and what more important in a maritime district than vessels that would sail well and last long. In conclu- sion he would say, that Eisteddfodau were calculated to direct into proper channels the wondrous amount of thought that everv rolling year was aroused, and which uncontrolled might become dangerous and ungovern- able; and lastly they promoted one of the greatest of all earthly blessings, peace, for he thought that the man who composed an awdl, wrote an englvn, or made a beehive for an Eisteddfod, would be II peaceful and well-disposed person\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda useful citizen, and a good man (lolld applause).

{"ocr": "I CARMARTHENSHIRE HUNT WEEK AND STEEPLE CHASES. STEwAHns,-T. D. LLOYD, E-Q OF BRONWYDD, AND W. CHAMBERS, JUN., ESQ., LLANELLY HOUSE. The English nation loves a horse, Adores a race, anllikei a bet of course, Not those fam'd mares which erst the prophet bore, Nor those fierce steeds Achilles lashed of yore Nor all which ever spurn'd Olympic dust, Tho' sung by Pindar's splf, and ta'en on trust By after :q-ps-coul,\u00c2\u00a1 compete with our- For swiftness, course, and enduring powers.\" Perhaps no event is so well calculated to dissipate the fatiguing ennui of winter in a provincial town, as a HUNT WEEK. In addition to the love of sport in- herent in man-for\" we were hunters from the be- ginning\"-there is always to be found in the reunion of friends and introduction of visitors which invariably attend the annual gathering of county families, so much'of pleasurable excitement, that an undesirable vacuum is inevitably created if by any misch vice the customary sports do not attain fruition. Who,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwith health of body and vigour of mind-has even entered into the participation of the amusements current during a Hunt Week, without becoming gradually allured with the numerous delightful sensations which assail him on all sides, and by creating a kind of Maelstrom of happi- ness, warm his better nature towards his fellow- beings and teach him to regard this occasional relixa- tion as one of the truest earthly pleasures. Who that has witnessed the throwing-off\" of Hounds will ever forget the melodious crash which reverberates through the cover at the first burst of pursuit, -who that has once followed the Chase, can fail to remember the rapid rush,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe daring leap\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand the mad gallop ? all of which tend to reinvigorate the body and Tune the mind to deeds of bravery.\" Then again, at the STEEPLE CHASE, does not the sight of some well-remembered face,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat of a rider for instance, famed for deeds of equestrianism-enkindle I within us a kindlier feeling of ardent enthusiasm for his well-earned name. The gallant steeds, parading 'ere they start,\" also add to the general excitement, while the many joyous faces we cannot but observe amongst the spectators on the Grand Stand, or in the various equipages, invariably tend to place us on better terms with humanity than if we were contented to plod life's dreary round\" uncheered by this Oasis of geniality in a season of universal loneliness. Nor less truly delightful\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthough in a different way\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdare the Terpsichorean meetings during a Hunt Week, for there the softer sex\" shed their genial influence o'er the the scene, and etiquette refines the out-door doings of the day, and recalls the ardent sportsman to the pro- prieties and amenities of gentility. The boisterous mirth of the ORDINARIES have also, doubtless, vo- taries. and Bacchus's revels occasionally outrival those of Diana or Terpsichore but surely in a week of so much to excite and delight,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwhere all is relaxation and amusement\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdsome trifling divergence may be looked on with a compassionate glance, indicative that the Hunt Week even thus fulfils its mission, by inculcating that true species of friendly charity, which forbids us to look otherwise than with forgiveness upon the errings of our fellow-beings. Having thus premised a few sentences upon the social effect of a Hunt Week, we may remind our readers that although the CHASE is a pastime, yet RACING was originally instituted in this country for the purpose of improving the breed of HORSES and much of the cele- brity which has been attained by the British Cavalry in action, is attributable to the fearlessness of danger inculcated from childhood by the frequent participation in the ride across country.\" The offering of prizes has been ever productive of much competition amongst, breeders of Horses, and has had the desired effect in rendering the English species of that noble friend and faithful servant of Man,\" almost unequalled throughout the world for speed and strength. The pathless deserts of Arabia, the dreary Steppes of Russia, the spacious plains of the Ukraine, the mighty Prairies of America, the wilds of Mexico, furnish alike their peculiar species of this noble animal in its aboriginal state, but it has been reserved for English judgment and scientific know- ledge to develope the powers of the nORSF. to its fullest perfection. The FLAT RACE and STEEPLE CHASE have alike contributed their quota of aid towards the attainment of this desideratum, the former having im- proved the fleetness, and the latter the strength and powers of endurance of our Horses. It is therefore not merely as a sporting exhibition that we view the STEE- PLE CHASE, but as tending also in a direct degree to give greater stamina to our steeds, and more dauntless courage to their riders than each already possess. The spirit of emulation too, unwittingly attaches itself to the spectators, and thus numbers of our youth are burning with enthusiastic ardour To witch the world with noble horsemanship.\" As we last week stated, the Programme\" of the Sports was judiciously selected, and nought remained to be desired but favourable weather for their due enjoyment. The Fates, however, were in this respect, unpropitious, for from an early hour on Monday, rain poured down incessantly in the neighbourhood of Carmarthen, and continued throughout the entire day. There would be nothing remarkable,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdalthough there was much to deplore,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin this circumstance, but for the fact that other portions of this and the adjoining Counties were entirely free from so unwelcome a visitor. In truth, at Swansea, Newcastle Emlyn, and Lampeter, not a drop of rain fell, but a beautiful genial spring day cheered the earth, and the sun shone forth with meri- dian splendour. At Lampeter, the paek of beagles belonging to R. 1. Dansey, Esq., and at Newcastle Emlyn, the Tivy Side Hounds, under the admirable mastership of W. H. Lewis, Esq., had excellent sport, the scent being nearly breast-high, and the hounds fol- lowing their prey with such intensity and rapidity that it was almost impossible for any horse to live with them. At Carmarthen, however, (such is the extraor- dinary variation of climate in this country) many old sportsmen declared that they have rarely experienced a more unsatisfactory day after hounds, there being scarcely any scent, and, as the rain was almost inces- sant, not much enjoyment was to be anticipated. MONDAY. I The meet\" took place at the Plough and Harrow, (in the parish of Newchurch) on the Conwil old road, about two miles from this town, where the gallant pack, hunted by that most zealous sportsman and true Welsh squire, W R H. Powell, Esq., Maesgwynne, assembled at ten o'clock. The field, notwithstanding the dismal state of the atmosphere, was large, comprising most of the sporting celebrities of the vicinity. After attempt- ing several covers, they found two foxes, when unfor- tunately the hounds separated, four dogs following one of the Reynard tribe, while the other was pursued by the remainder of the pack. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Then was there heard, Beginning faint, but rising still more loud, And nearer, voice of hunters and of hounds, And horns, hoarse-winded, blowing far and keen\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Forthwith the hubbub multiplies the gale Labours with wilder shrieks, and rifer din Of hot pursuit \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The shouts of men, And hoofs, thick beating on the hollow hill, Sudden the grazing heifer in the vale Starts at the noise, and both the herdman's ears Tingle with inward dread. Aghast he eyes The mountain's height, and all the ridges round, But soon a trace of living wights discerns; And knows, o'erawed, and trembling as he stands, At once to whom he owes his sudden fear.\" The Chase proceeded vigorously, notwithstan ling the density of the fog and the drizzling rain but both foxes made use of that discretion\" which is the better part of valour,\" and manage d to get clear off, despite the most earnest efforts of their pursuers, who returned home thoroughly jaded and dispirited from the com- bined effects of the weather and the unsuccessful issue of the sport. TUESDAY. = I This being the day appointed for the crack\" race of the week, considerable anxiety was manifested with respect to the weather, and surely from early dawn\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd (if the transient struggles of daylight through a misty rain can be so characterised)\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdSt. Swithin himself could not have been dissatisfied with the dense soaking drizzle which continuously descended. Strange to say, however, the racing amateurs of Carmarthen, determined not to be deprived of such a view of the sports as could he attaiiied,- absolutely crowded towards the scene of operation. Every description of vehicle was of course promptly in requisition from the aristocratic drag\" to the more humble von horse shay.\" Dog carts, phcetGns, a stage coach, and an omnibus, each conveyed its load of living freight, who braved the weather with un- wearied complacency, and exhibited patience of the most exemplary kind. The number of equestrians was, if anything, larger than we remember to have seen on any previous occasion while there could not have been less than from 2,000 to 3,000 spectators on the course, who manfully kept their ground despite the pitiless peltings of the storm.\" It may be readily conjectured that there were not many l i lies present, although there certainly were a-select few\" who dared the elements in order to witness the sport. Amongst the company present we observed :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWm. Chambers, junior, Esq., Steward, (T. D. Lloyd, Esq., of Bronwydd, his colleague, being unavoidably absent from indisposition), W. Morris, Esq., W. R. H. Powell, Esq., Maesgwynne, E. R. Wood, Esq., Stouthall, Baron de Rutzen Frentz, G?o L,rt Puilipps, Esq., Dale Castle, R. Lort Philipps, Esq., J. L.

Staniforth, &c., &c. The day was so excessively wet and foggy that it was impossible to see further than the;first fence-that lead- ing out of the starting field-and although we were assured that the course was admirably adapted for a full view of the entire race, yet not an individual present could witness more than two of the leaps, nor in fact any more of the race than was discernible at the start,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd the rapid transit of the horses through the winning field on their second round,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand the finish. Conside- rable delay took place after the signal to saddle had been sounded, occasioned by a debate as to the pro- priety and practicability of attempting the race, but all discussion on the subject was somewhat peremptorily closed by Mr. Lort Phillips declaring that as the Races had been advertised for that day, if no other nags started his horse should walk over the course, and he would claim the stakes from the Stewards. This settled the matter, and the gentlemen riders\" having weighed, saddled and mounted, in the midst of a heavy shower of rain, the preliminary gallops were performed in most curious guise, the horses being fully clothed, and their riders wearing great coats or cavalry cloaks. Surely but few Steeple Chases have ever been commenced under such disheartening auspices. THE COURSE. From such inform-ation as we were enabled to obtain (although no portion of the race was visible excepting that which we have just specified) we may state that the starting field was situated on a farm called Waun- corgamfawr, the property of D. A. S. Davies, Esq., M.P., which is detached from the farm of which it forms a por- tion, and is almost entirely surrounded by the lands of Lletternoyadd. After leaving this field, the course assumed a south westerly direction for 4 or 5 fields, some of them being under wheat and clover. Here the horses had to cross a road, and then a dingle, at the bottom of which was a narrow brook, to be cleared by a leap from the top of a fence ;\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthence the race was to be continued over Gilfach lands, up the hill, when a detour was mide to the eastward, which gradually sloped round in'a northerly direction until the course again crossed the road, but at a different point. From this the race again turned westerly until the starting field was reached, from whence the same circuit was again followed, leaving a long piece of turf to run home,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe race terminating nearly opposite the Grand Stand, in the same field from whence the start took place. The distance to be run was as near four miles as possibly, comprising forty-five leaps, some of them of rather a ticklish description. [We should perhaps here mention that a spacious Stand had been very substantially erected under the superintendence of Mr. J. L. Collard, and had it been clear weather, an excellent view of the Races would have been obtained from it, but as matters turned out its occupants fared no better than the other spectators, excepting that they were well provided as regarded shelter. There were no less than thirteen Booths erected in the field, which were crowded with occupants, and doubtless the owners reaped a better harvest that would have been the case had the weather been less boisterous. ] The ground was in dreadful order, and it was easy to prophesy that there would be many a gallant fellow compelled to bite tlie-ditst\"-we were going to write, out\" mild\" would be the more appropriate word,- before the close of the day. About two o'clock the horn sounded the signal to start for THE OPEN STEEPLE CHASE, Of 10 Sovs. each, 5 forfeit, with JE70 added, for any horse, over about four miles of country.

Lewis, na., b.g, Toll- bar, by Glick. G. Morgan. 6 When the horses were stripped\" it was curious to see how quietly Jack Itees walked Hazard backwards and forwards, looking as knowingly as possible, and ap- parently determined that if his horse was not in the van, it should be no fault of his. Hazard is a bay horse, and although not 15 hands high, exhibits every point of a thorough bred animal, being a direct descendant (we were informed) of the celebrated Eclipse. lIe displayed great strength and capability of vast speed, while the light weight with which he had been handicapped in com- parison to the other horses, rendered him a great fa- vourite with the betting men. Squire [qly, to our mind, looked literally an ugly customer and Esmeralda, although rather too fleshy, took her gallop with magni- ficent action. It was evident from the deep and earnest conversation between the brothers Davies as they walked their horses up and down the course, that they were aware that a sufficiency of work would be cut out for them, and eventually the spectators gradually divided themselves into groups of partisans for the Carmarthen- shire and Pembrokeshire horses respectively. The Skipper looked wickedly inclined and Dandelion (ad- mirably ridden by a servant boy of Mr. Logan Downes's,) leaped over the first fence backwards and forward s in very good style, the lad sitting his horse with the ease and self-possession of older jockeys. Tollbar was what is called a dark horse,\" and therefore speculation was not very rife respecting him but we heard it whispered that he was not in a condition to exhibit his prowess to the best advantage, having been recently undergoing medical treatment. However, the horses, as they drew up for the start, pre- sented a very neat and picturesque appearance, 11 in spite of wind and weather.\" Mr. Jeremiah Olive acted with great judgment as Clerk of the Course, and effected an admirable start without a second attempt. Esmeralda having stormed the breach in the first fence, was quickly followed by the Squire, Hazard, and Skipper. The others also got over well. From this spot, the race was lost to view, but we have learnt that Esmeralda made the running, with Skipper, Ugly, and Hazard, all well up, and the other two following at a convenient, but respectful distance. In this order they progressed across the road, (which we are told Tollbar took nearly at a flying leap from fence to fence) over the brook, and up the hill for about 3 or 4 fields, Hazard being then second. Away swept the gallant steeds- Down, down the precipice wild they break, Where the foaming waters roar; And then up the brow of the mountain take Where horse never trod before.\" And with regard to each daring rider\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd No checking hand to the rein he lends On slippery summits sheen But ever and aye his head he bends At the plunge in some dark ravine,\" About four fences from the brook, Skipper had a. dreadful fall, but his rider was soon up again and on the onward track. Hence they proceeded with as much rapidity as the heavy nature of the ground would allow, until they again crossed the road near the farm-house, Esmeralda leading with Ugly second, and Hazard third. Upon reaching the starting field, Esmeralda still kept the lead, with Hazard close upon her quarters, and Ugly third. Dandelion, to' every one's surprise, was in a good fourth position, with Tollbar fifth, and Skipper (who had lost ground from his fall) a long way behind. Just as the last-named horse reached the fence of the starting field, the crowd, forgetful of his being behind, had begun to close together after the passage of the leading horses, and Skipper running foul of a dragoon, refused his fence. After a struggle, however, he was forced over, but it was evident he had lost all chance of success. Esmeralda, meanwhile, continued her rapid flight, with Dandelion second, Uihj third, and Hazard fourth. In this order they continued to the brook, where Hazard fell, a regular burster,\" coming on his headitn the mud, and pitching poor Jack Rees upon his proboscis, which was beautifully barked\" on the occa- sion, and his whole countenance transmogrified into the appearance of one of the Ethiopian serenadcrs. It is fortunate that Jack chose a soft place for his spill, and that his head was somewhat of the hardest, for otherwise such a violent concussion must have inevitably placed him hors de combat. As it was, however, scarcely two seconds elapsed ere he was once more on the pigskin, and as if his misfortune had added to his energy, he let Hazard show his pace, and from that moment he held the issue of the race in his own hands. Dandelion was second when Hazard's mishap occurred, but he had n\" reason to grin at his brother jock's misfortune, for at", "word": "3", "description": "\u2026, the spacious plains of the Ukraine, the mighty Prairies of America, the wilds of Mexico, furnish alike their peculiar species of this noble animal in its aboriginal state, but it has been reserved for English judgment and scientific know- ledge to develope the powers of the nORSF. to its fullest perfection.

{"ocr": "I FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. I .1, I FRANCE. I The proclamation of the representatives just elected for Paris, was made at the Hotel de Ville, on Friday evening. It was as follows: Socialists Carnot, 132,797; Vidal, 128,139; De Flotte, 120,982.Nlodc,- rates\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Foy, 125,0! i)e Lahitte, 125,472; Bonjean, 121,317. The number of registered electors is 33(5,918. The number of votes ascertained as given up to Thurs- day is 20-5,-574. One effect of the elections has been to create a panic in the Government. It is even said that so soon as the result of the Paris elections were known, the President of the Republic had almost decided on re- signing, but that he was dissuaded from so doing by General Changarnier. M. Dupin, President of the Assembly, was summoned to the Elysoe to advise with the President of the Republic on the state of affairs. The result of all has been various ministerial changes, and a new Minister, that of Police, is to be created General Chan?arnier, M M. Tliiei-s, d,- Brolic, de Montalembert, Berryer, and de Saint. Priest were summoned on Friday to the Elysee to deliberate with and assist by their advice the President of the Republic in the present state of affairs. It is stated that the Pre- sident placed himself entirely in their hands, and re- quested them to advise him in the formation of a Ministry. M. Berryer is understood to have declared that, for his part, his taking office at this moment would only make the situation worse, as it would give any Cabinet to which he might belong a Legitimist character, which should be avoided. Ni. Montalembert is said to have expressed a contrary opinion. M. Thiers is descri- bed as having expressed repugnance, but only on account of his personal affairs, to take office he said, however, that as the circumstances were so momentous he should be ready to sacrifice his personal affairs and feelings to the good of his country, and, if his presence in power were, after mature deliberation, believecllikely to contri- bute to that good, he would place himself at the disposal of the President of the Republic. General Changarnier is said to have repeated his determination to do his utmost-to maintain order and to support the authority of the Government. Seventeen. Arabs have just quitted the Chateau of Amboise, to return to Africa. They proceeded to Alar- seilles, and thence to Osan. Amongst these Arabs is an old man, 100 years of age, the uncle of Abd-el-Kader. One of them has become so initiated in French manners and customs as to be a very accomplished dancer of the polka. GERMANY AND DENMARK. The Deutsche Zeitung of the ISth inst., states, from Frankfort, that the Prince Gortshakoff, His Majesty the Czar's Ambassador and Plenipotentiary at the Provi- sional Federal Commission, has in the course of some diplomatic formalities refused to deliver up his cre- dentials, unless the wishes of Russia respecting Schles- wig were peremptorily complied with. His demands are 1. The recognition of Baron Bulow, as official repre- sentative of His Majesty of Denmark, in his capacity as Duke of Holstein and Lauenburg. 2. Recognition of the Danish Convention, of an armistice, and of the preliminaries of a peace of the 10th of July, 1849 and \"3. Instructions to Prussia for the immediate conclu- sion of a peace on the ground of the said preliminaries.\" In return, the Federal Commission has resolved not to communicate with the Prince Gortshakoff until he has complied with all the customary formalities. THE PAPAL STATES. The Roman Journal of the 14th instant publishes the following official riotice:- \"Their Eminences the Cardinals composing the Com- mittee of State, having received the pleasing intelligence of the return of his Holiness, Pius IX., to his domini- ons, during the first week of Easter, have communicated it to the Ministers, in order that they may severally adopt on the occasion the measures which concern them.\" GREECE. I I Accounts from Athens of the Stn inst., mention that the French envoy, commissioned to effect a recon- ciliation between England and Greece, had had an au- dience of the King, by whom he was graciously re- ceived; and that the differences between the two coun- tries, would, in all probability, be satisfactorily arranged. PRUSSIA. OPENING OF THE GERMAN PARLIAMENT. I Erfurt, March 20.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Parliament of the German Union, to give it its present legal title, was opened this morning. The preparations for the event have kept the old town of Erfurt for many months past in a state of unusual activity, and the place has not been the centre of so much political interest since the Congress of Sove- reigns held in it by Napoleon in 1808. The proceedings of the day were opened by the Siuigerbund\" of Erfurt, one of the most celebrated in Germany, which, in spite of the inclement weather, the ground being covered with snow, volunteered a pro- cession through the principal streets of the town, ter- minatilwat the cathedral, from the raised terrace of which they sang a chorus. At ten o'clock divine service was performed in the Wigberti church for the Catholic and in the Barfusser church for the Protestant deputies. The members of both Houses assembled at noon in the saloon of the Government House, where the session was opened by the President of the Administrative Council in an address. The deputies then retired to their respective houses. The town is full but not crowded, as the number of houses is large in proportion to that of the inhabitants like many other German cities, Erfurt has never re- covered the ruin of the '*() roars' wftr it had, before that period, from 80,000 to 90,000 inhabitants it has not now a third of the number. WURTEMBURG. I The Diet of the kingdom of Wurtemburg was opened on the 15th inst., by the King in person. The speech from the throne is looked upon as an important docu- ment. After declaring that the German UnitaTiun State is one of the most dangerous chimeras for Ger- many as well as for Europe, the King stales that he has entered into negotiations with Bavaria and Saxony for the purpose of establishing an understanding on a draught of a constitution for the totality of Germany. He rejoices to be able to inform the members of the Diet of the success of these negotiations, and of the fact that that success has been sanctioned by the Government of His Majesty the Emperor of Austria. IJ^ibOpes that his endeavours will, in future, be crowned with success. PRUSSIA AND WDRTEMB L Jttu. A telegraphic despatch from Berlin Of the 2:1rd inst., ,-Lto zievs of the in the Kolner Zeitung, corroborates the! late news of the revocation of the Prussian Ambassador from the Court of Wurtemburg, Baron Sydow has been instructed im- mediately to leave Stuttgard with all the members of the embassy. The PI ussian Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Baron Schleinitz, has addressed a note to the W urtemburg Am bassador at the Prussian Court, notifying to that di plomatist the total rupture of all relations between the two governments. AUSTRIA. The Daily News states that an important step towards the settlement of Hungarian affairs has been made. A great number of Magyars, old conservatives, headed by Count Desewyffy, had an audience with the Emperor, and presented him a rather voluminous memorial, em- bodying the fundamental principles on which their party wishes to see the Hungarian statute founded. The first condition is the dismissal of Bach from the ministry. We learn from Constantinople that Count Sturmur has not yet taken any step to enter into communication with the Porte. The Sultan is reported to have had a fit of apoplexy, which has caused the greatest anxiety. CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. Letters and papers have been received from the Cape of Good Hope to the 15th of January, at which date the final decision from the home government respecting the disposal of the convicts in Simon's Bay had not arrived. The anti-convict associations continued their meetings, and adopted measures in anticipation of the possibility of the dreaded step of landing the convicts being taken by the government. Every thing, however, was con- ducted with the best feelings, and with less excitement than formerly characterised their proceedings. From all parts of the colony the most convincing proofs of the firmness of the country people-of their fidelity to each other, and of their patience under suspense\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdcontinued hp tn r\"\"pivcd. AMERICA. Mr. Calhoun's address on the slavery question was delivered to the House on the 4th instant, creating much sensation. He was in such a state that he could scarcely be expected to recover, and as he was unable to undergo the fatigue of peaking, in consequence of the diseased state of his lungs, a brother senator, Mr. Mason, under- took the delivery of his speech. Mr. Calhoun scarcely names Mr. Clay's plan, and censures in no slight mea- sure the movements towards the construction of a state out of California. He opposes the admission of that State-cites precedents\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand concludes with an appeal to senators upon their duties\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdintimating that the ad- mission of California will be a sufficient evidence of the future intentions of the North, and will enable the South to adopt such a course as will comport with her honour and safety. The mercantile advices from New York are favourable as regards the money and stock markets, but in other respects they contain nothing of importance. The rise in stocks had been chiefly caused by the continuance of the ElIropean demand. Money was abundant, and in New York, as in most of the othercitie-softhe new world at this tiiiie, large amounts appear to be seeking invest- ment. The importations of foreign goods had been large, and there was every sign that an active business would be maintained, but the steady decline in cotton on this side during the last few weeks will probably render it henceforth lc buoyant than had been antici- pated. By \"the accounts from Mexico, via Mobile, it ap- pears that the United States Minister, Mr. Robert P. Letcher, had arrived in that capital on the 2tid of Feb. and that at that period political affairs were perfectly quiet. The correspondent of the A eto York Journal of Com- merce, writing from Washington on the 23rd ultimo, says \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd 11 It is perfectly certain that a treaty has been made here between Sir Henry L. Bulwer, and the Govern- ment of the United States respecting the Nicaragua question A friend on whom reliance can be placed has seen the document, with all the official signatures at- tached. It provides for the restoration of Tigre Island to its former owners. It fails to recognise the pro- cef'dms of both Mr. Squires and Mr. Chatneld. It also provides that neither En?and nor the United States shall exercise sovereignty or jurisdiction within the ceutrai American states. ltaareesthatGreytown ()atc San Juan de Nicaragua) shall be a neutral or free port, a, well as another port on the at the western ter- minus of the route.\" From California we learn that the city of the Sacra- mento has been overflowed by water. But few spots of land are visible, and the inhabitants are suffering terribly from this dreadful and unheard-of calamity. The loss by this unlooked-for visitation is estimated at over one million of dollars. Immense herds of cattle and other- property have been swept away. While this great flood, however, destroys a great dcai of property, it will wash, out the gold in immense quantities. A party of Chilians had made an attack upon the Americans at the mines in the vicinity of Stockton, in which two of the assailed were killed. INDIA. I The overland mail has arrived. The only intelligence of interest is the account of some mutinous conduct on the part of the Ofith Bengal Infantry, at Umritsir, Lahore. The discontent appears to hare arisen from the quantity of their food. On tli,, 211d tilt., decided symp- toms of ill-feeling still continuing to manifest themselves, Iajor Troup ordered a native officer, who appeared most forward in the movement, into arrest. The order was instantly met by an endeavour of the main body of the men to rescue him but the personal exertions of Major Trollp and his officers induced them to resume something like order in the ranks. Colonel Bradford, of the 1st Light Cavalry, who happened to be within the fort, quietly proceeded to his camp. and ordered his men to mount. Major Troup, who never lost his temper during the whole of the scene, concluded his address by directing the men to pile their arms. As this was being done, a party of the 1st Cavalry, some forty or fifty strong, appeared at the gate, which the company of the mutinous regiment on duty there hastened to close, but not effectually. Captain Macdonald, the officer of the day, drawing his sword, and driving away the men crowding round, managing to prevent it, and to admit the men of the 1st cavalry. The Sepoys of the 66th, seeing that they were now all but helpless, and that the possession of the fort would pass out of their hands, made a rush to resume their arms, in which endeavour they succeeded very partially, being prevented by their omcprs,seconded by the efforts of their troopers. The whole regiment was thereupon marched out of the fort, and those who still had arms deprived of them. The body guard arrived very soon afterwards, and took pos session of the fort, and were to be speedily followed by two European companies. The mutineers were placed on the glacis within range of the guns of the fort, charged with grape, and surrounded by the troopers of the 3rd regiment of the Punjab Cavalry (Prendergast's), who had been summoned to the scene of this unfortu- nate but most serious disturbance. Everything con- tinued tranquil throughout the Punjab. Sir C. Napier reached Rawul Pindee on the 20th, and was expected at Peshawur by the end of January. The recent unhappy event at Umritsir would most probably hurry him back to the capital sooner than he had intended. The troops were everywhere, except at Mooltan, in good health. Sir T. E. M. Turton, Bart., late ecclesiastical regis- trar at Calcutta, has been sentenced to imprisonment for two years, under the penal clause of the insolvent Act, after the expiration of which he is to be allowed the benefit of the said Act. The agitation against the Black Act\" continues. Captain Watt, who com- manded the party of the 43rd M.N.I, which fled before a few score of Moplahs on the Malbar coast in August last. had been sentenced by Court Martial to be placed at the bottom of the list of captains in his corps. There are said to be a large number of Queen's and Company's officers now awaiting trial for various offences in the Bengal presidency Sir Charles Napier sparing none who may have the misfortune to forget themselves. Among those under arrest is Lieutenant Colonel Ousley, late agent to the Governor General on the south-west frontier. CHINA. (From the China Mail of Jan. 30.)\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn the eve of the departure of the last Overland Mail we announced that the three Chinese taken at the barrier after the murder of the Governor of Macao, and since retained by the Council had been at length given up. Some of our home readers may require to be reminded that the Chinese Viceroy made the surrender of these men the condition of his restoring the head and hand of Governor Amaral, which, it may be remembered, had been re- covered from one of the murderers. The head had been well preserved, and both it and the hand were readily recognised.

{"ocr": "I MISCELLANEOUS INTELLIGENCE. The Queen held a levee (the second this season) on Thursday afternoon in St. James's Palace. Before the levee her Majesty Rave audience to Lord J. Russell. The Queen wore a black silk train trimmed with crape, and a black silk petticoat also trimmed with crape. Her Majesty wore black ornaments for the head-dress, On Wednesday her Majesty received the intelligence of the death of the Princess Elise of Hohenlohe- Langenbotirz.-His Royal Highness Prince Albert ( presided over a meeting of the Royal Comruision for the Promotion of the Exhibition of the Works of In- dustry of all Nations. Her Majesty is once more in that interesting situa- tion which promises to add another member to the Royal Family. The Gazette contains a notification of the elevation of the Irish Baron de Freyne to the dignity of a peer of Great Britain and Ireland, by the title of Baron de Freyne, of Coolavin, county Siigo, with remainder, in default of heirs male, to his brother, Mr. Fitzstephen Ffrench. At the last Court ball at Vienna, a lady belonging to a high noble family refused, rather disdainfully, to dance with a young officer, decorated, but not noble. The Emperor, observing what had taken place, exchanged a few words with his mother, the Archduchess Sophia, and then, addressing the young officer, \u00c3\u00b8aid-\" Mv mother wishes to waltz with you.\" The Emperor of Russia has ordered that manufacturers and tradesmen who intend to visit the Great Exhibition at London shall be exempted from the payment of the passport-tax. The Morning Post thinks it may be true that Pro- tection is no more, in the sense in which Free-traders wish to understand Protection, and which sense many of its advocates seem inclined to accept. If we look upon Protection as a system devised simply in relation to one class, a plan to foster and protect that class irrespectively of the interests of the community, then it may be true enough that Protection is dead.\" This admission is all that Mr. Cobden asks for. Seventy-one members of the House of Commons claim to be excused from serving on election committees, on the grouud of being respectively more than sixty years of age. There are upwards of forty peers connected with the army in the House of Lords. Punch says that the Protectionists in Parliament, who, as a judicious housewife had observed, are trying to get up a ferment to make the bread rise, will be known to after ages as The Members who quarrelled with the Belly.\" Fourteen waggons, each containing one ton of shot, arrived at the Crystal Palace in the beginning of the week, the shot being intended to be used in testing the galleries. Two elderly people of the name of Cole, were received into Bristol infirmary, from the vicinity of Horfield, on Sunday week. They lived adjoining a limekiln, and were in the habit of getting up early every morning for the purpose of milking some cows and, not making their appearance as usual, their door was forced open, and they were found nearly suffocated by the fumes from the kiln. They are doing well. The Washington Monument, now in process of erection at New York, is to be 500 feet high, 55 feet square at the base, and 33 feet square at the top. It is now 76 feet high, and has cost 12,000 dollars, having taken two years to bring it to its present elevation. The Midland Counties Railway are having erected a monster corn warehouse at Nottingham, sufficient to store 14,000 quarters of corn. The farmers of the vicinity, it is said, by this building will have a greater chance ofselling without submitting to a reduction in price. On Saturday, the Earl of Eglinton was elected by a majority of all the nations,\" Lord Rector of Aberdeen College. The noble lord's opponent was Sir Charles Lyell. A correspondent of the Western Times states that there is a beneficed clergyman in the neighbourhood of Kingsbridge, who, having a judgment of the County Court entered against him, has barricaded his house, and keeps himself a close prisoner during the six days of the week on which the bailiffs are watching for him, and sallies out on the seventh 10 pray to his flock-so that in his parish it is watch and pray all the week round. The Cincinnati S\u00c3\u00b9npareil observes a coincidence and a difference The streets yesterday were thronged with ladies going to church, and with hogs going to the slaughter-house. We remarked a difference in the two. The former were dressed jesterday, the latter will he dressed to-day. The Athewrum states that Mr. Marshall Claxton has received a commission from Miss Burdett Coutts to paint three large pictures for her church and school- room in Rochester-row, Westminster. The subjects are, Christ blessing Little Children,\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" The Sacrifice of Noah,\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand The Flight into E.'ypt.\" When the copper coins of the last reign appeared, a slight tinge in the colour of the metal excited the sus- picion of those accustomed to examine such things that it contained gold, which proved to be the fact hence their real value was greater than that for which they passed current, and they were speedily collected and melted down by manufacturers, principally, I believe, as an alloy to gold, whereby every particle of that metal which they contained was turned to account. I have been told that various Birmingham establishments had agents in different parts of the country appointed to collect this coinage.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Notes and Queries. A great number of forged Bank of England notes are in circulation. They are principally f5 notes, very well executed, with the exception of the water mark and the signatures, the latter being lithographed instead of written. No less then seven of these notes have fallen into the hands of the police in Wolverhampton. Hundreds of lives might have been saved by a know- ledge of this simple recipe-a large teaspoonful of made mustard mixed in a tumbler of warm water, and swallowed as soon as possible, acts as an instant emetic, sufficiently powerful to remove all that is lodged in the stomach. The number of bathers at the four establishments in London already exceeds 1,150,000 and the number of women who have washed and dried the clothes of themselves and families, amounts to no less than 215.000. The Licerpool Standard describes a teetotal prodigy in a Miss Harrison, a girl nine years of age, who was last week presented with a skeleton lever watch, at a public tea meeting at Toxteth Park-200 being present -for persuading her father to abandon his trade as a publican, and other services, as a teetotal lecturer, The young lady, we are told, made a suitable reply, saying she had done no more than her duty, but she would cherish the gift, and when she gazed upon it, it would 1 remind her of the rapid flight of time, and her duty to seek her own improvement and that of the whole human race. During the week considerable interest has been mani- fested in London by a report that several clerks of a bank in Lombard-street had been detected in perpetra- ting robberies to a considerable extent. Three clerks are supposed to be implicated in the fraud, one of whom has been apprehended, and continues in custody. The extent of defalcation is reported to be \u00c2\u00a3 10,000. On Friday, a warrant was granted by the Lord Mayor for the capture of one of the clerks, who had absconded with money to the amount of \u00c2\u00a3 5,000. At the Liverpool police-office on Tuesday, George Bewley, master of the ship Rotunda, was fined \u00c2\u00a35 and costs for neglecting to supply suitable lime juice to his crew, on a voyage to Madras. Several of the crew were afflicted with scurvy in consequence, and one of the people had died. The information was laid by Charles Baker, a coloured man, who was cook of the ship. The fine was paid by the defendant, and the magistrate ad- vised him to settle the affair with the rest of the crew, as he would be liable to a fine of \u00c2\u00a3 5 for every man on board should they bring him into court. At the spring commencements, which took place on Tuesday, in the University of Dublin, the honorary degree of LL.D. was presented to Lord Gough. The gallant veteran appeared in the examination hall in the full uniform of a general oiffcer, and was loudly and most cordially cheered by the crowds who were assembled on the occasion in the court and hall. Amongst those who took Doctors' degrees were the hon. members for the University, J. Napier, M.P., and G A. Hamilton, M.P. Galiqnani states that an aeronaut, named Grellon, is now exhibiting feats at Pan, which throw the adven- turous perftirmances of MM. Poitevin and Gale completely into the shade. This gentleman, when at a considerable height in the air, left the car, and, placing his feet in two iron rings suspended from the net work, suddenly flung himself head downwards, and remained in that position for several minutes. He afterwards recovered hi\" place in the car, aud descended safely. The Ipswich Express tells a story of\" sham poison- ing.\" A dissolute young fpllow went into a puMic- liou-e, told a mrid-servailt that he had taken arittnic because his family had discarded him, and expressed by violent contortions the agony caused by the poison. The upshot was. that thrpp surgeons were speedily it- y i,i attendance, armed with stomach-pumps the dismayed suicide protested that he had been shamming\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhe had 1 taken no poison. But this statement was only consi- | dered as proving his determination to die of the arsenic so the surgeons went to work with him, and tortuicd him for a considerable time before they were sa:i*;ied of the sham.

Miss Gibbs, daughter of the exalderman, has been appointed matron to the school at Hertford, belonging to Christ's Hospital. More than 5,000 persons sleep every night in the cellars of the city of Dublin. The production of gold and silver in Mexico now exceeds that of any furmer period. A decree has been published for the taking of a census of the population of France. By the law of France, no priest, no doctor, or attor- ney, is allowed to accept a death-bed legacy. A lighthouse of corrugated iron is being constructed in London for the American government. An American has succeeded in constructing a furnace by which glass is manufactured with no other fuel than anthracite coal. Charles Cartwright, described as a sherifrs officer, is in custody in London on a charge of obtaining goods to the value of \u00c2\u00a3 2,000, on a forged order, with intent to defraud the London and North-Western Railway. About 1,000 men are said to be employed in construct- ing the railway across the Isthmus of Panama. Some thousands of bells, for the outward decoration of a Malay prince, have been made in Birmingham. The Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers have re- ceived and adopted Mr. Frank Foster's estimate of the charges for carrying out the plan for draining the northern portion of the metropolis. The gross amount required, exclusive of compensation, will be \u00c2\u00a3 1,080,000, which will be raised and paid of by an additional rate of 3d. in the pound for thirty years. The University of Berlin has recently established a class of stenography, to which Dr. Michaelis, a reporter of the Second Chamber, has been appointed professor. This is, we believe, the first instance of the useful art of the shorthand writer being so honoured. M. Flocon, one of the French Provisional Government, proposed, it is true, that stenography should form part of the public instruction in France, but his proposal was rejected. Lambeth Ragged Schools were publicly opened on Wednesday last. These schools, the largest of the kind in the metropolis, and by far the most spacious and elegant in construction, have been built at the sole expense of Henry Benjamin Hanbury Beaufoy, Esq., of Carlton-place, South Lambeth, at the munificent cost of E10,000, in addition to which the benevolent donor has invesed the sum of \u00c2\u00a34,000 in the funds, the interest derivable from which is to be appropriated to the keeping of the building in permanent repair. On Wednesday afternoon. a fire, invohing a serious destruction of valuable property, broke out in the premises of Mr. Smith, perfumer, 1 Princes-street. Oxford-street, London. The adjoining premises of Mr. Osborne, silversmith, also sustained considerable damage. Napoleon Junot, Duke of Abrantes, the cider of the two sons who survived the late Marshal, has just died, in his 44th year, in a lunatic asylum near Paris. He was eccentric all his life, yet possessed of considerable literary ability. It has been reported by Mr. Porter, of the Board of Trade, that the working classes expend annually on the three articles of gin, beer, and tobacco, \u00c2\u00a3 57,900,000. On Sunday last, a child was killed at Bury, with oil of vitriol, which an elder brother, aged 12 years, had given him, supposing it to be water. In the parish of Llanfihangel, near Llanfylin, Mont- gomeryshire, a young servantgirl, near her confinement, horrible to relate, opened her side with a pair of scissors, and thus delivered herself of a full-grown infant. She was detected in the act of stitching up the wound thus so unnaturally inflicted on her person. Medical aid was immediately procured, but she died at the house of her parents in a few days from morti- fication. Accounts from Holyhead state that the New York packet-ship Yorkshire has been placed under arrest, by authority of a warrant issued by the High Court of Admiralty, at the instance of the City of Dublin Packet and the Chester and Holyhead Railway com- panies; the former claiming \u00c2\u00a310,000 for services ren- dered by the Prince of Wales in towing the said vessel into the harbour, and the latter claiming \u00c2\u00a33,000 for similar services rendered by the Anglia. In the Insolvent Debtors' Court, London, on Thurs- day last, Mr. Kenealy, barrister, applied for his dis- charge from the Queen's Bench Prison, where he had been in custody at the suit of the Guardians of the West London Union for costs raising on the indict- ment recently preferred against him for ill-treating a child. The insolvent was ordered to be discharged forthwith. A pilgrim from the East writes When that wise man of the East, Dwakanath Tagare, visited the Pope, his Holiness asked him, How do you like our religion ?' Very much indeed,' said the Baboo, very good re- ligion, vei-Y like the Hindoo.' No wonder Dwarkanath was struck with the resemblance-the worship of the saints of the Catholics tallies with the Hindoo worship of deified mortals. Excommunication is similar to loss of caste. The long processions accord with those of the Hindoo, and the Hindoo idols are often tricked out in silk and satin, and gold and finery-ditto those of Rome. and the priests of both religions are infallible.\" The balloon conveying the Duke of Brunswick, and his friends. on arriving at a sufficient altitude, took a south- easterly direction, passing over the counties of Surrey and Kent in the direction of the Continent. The balloon with its voyagers, descended safely at Gravesend about two hours after leaving Vauxhall-gardens, the Duke having found the wind suddenly become adverse to the particular course which he meant to take. He is however, still determined to carry out his intention, and will ascend again as soon as the wind becomes favour- able. The case of St. Barnabas, Pimlico, has been sub- mitted to Dr. Addams and Mr. Baddeley, who have given it as their opinion that there is no course open to the parishioners, by which their object of retaining Mr. Bennett in the incumbency of St. Paul and St. Barnabas can be legally effected, and that the Bishop of London cannot in any manner be compelled to state seriatim his reasons for considering Mr. Bennett unfaithful to the Church of England. They also express themselves as of opinion that the not giving the cup into the hands of the communicants, and the not delivering the bread into their hands, are violations of the rubric which are only excusable on the ground of necessity as, for instance, when any communicant is infirm, Bird there might, therefore, be daller of some accident or inde- cency from the contrary practice. The language of tbe rubric is express as to delivering the bread into the hand' of the communicants, and it is difficult to see how the delivery of the cup (not the wine, nor the 'sacra- ment of the blood,' as in the rubric of Edward VI first Prayer-book) can be performed, unless by g.vm\" \u00c2\u00b0 it into the hand of the communicant.\" The Sardinian brig Arpia, Captain Barthoietto, has arrived in the Mersey with the expected Hungarian refugees. The vessel is direct from Constantinople, and brings 262 passengers. These people are confided to the care of the authorities in Liverpool, who have made arrangements with Mr. Sabell, of the Emigrant. Home, in Moorfields, to receive them. Though the vtssei winch brought them over is small, there has been no sickness on board, and they speak in high terms of the treatment they have met with on the voyage, and also of the conduct of the Turkish people during their stay of eighteen months in that country. They consist chiefly of Poles, mixed with Italians and Hungarians, and they are of all grades in rank. They are exceedinglv poor, though healthy and in good spirits. An attempt wiil now be made to further their interests by opening a subscription in Liverpool, with the object of forwarding them to Arreiica.

The Royal party then directed their steps to i the sectiOA of'machinery in motion, and proceeded with the inspection of a vast number of remarkable objects which they had not seen during their last visit. They were again attended by Mr. Cubitt and Mr. Hensman, who, with the ex- hibitors themselves, explained to them the leading features of the different machines. They spent some time iil exa- mining the tools exhibited by Whitworth, of Manchester. They then passed in review the meritorious contributions of Sharpe, the wire-dpawing process of Johnson, Hick's illus- trations of the power obtainable by the hydraulic-press-punch, the method of proving cast-iron beams exhibited by Cottam and Hallam, Ryder's remarkable maehine for forging spin- dles, Holzapffel's ingenious specimgpi pf turning in the lathe, Maudsley's new coining press, by which during their stay some medals were struck, the fine models of marine engines by the same maker, and the rope-making machine exhibited by Crawhall, of Newcastle, dispensing with the usual long gallery hitherto required in that manufacture. The Royal party also paid marked attention to Lawson's ex- tensive display of flax machinery, and to the beautiful spe- cimens of linen which he produced as examples of its efficiency. The hemp machinery of Plumber was much noticed; and the canvass loom, with its products, exhibited by Mr. B. Browne. Passing by the lace and silk machinery in the meantime, her Majesty and the Prince proceeded to inspect the printing presses; and here of course their chief attention was directed to Applegath's invention, which is exhibited by Mr. Ingram, of the Illustrated London Neics. They also greatly admired M'Cfure's lithographic press, and the contributions of Napier, Waterloo, and others. It was half-past 11 o'clock before they took their departure from the Building, and, as on previous occasions, they were most affable to the numerous body of exhibitors with whom they conversed. The Building was kept well watered, and was delightfully cool and pleasant during the day. The num- ber admitted was about 47,754. The cash account was as follows :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd At the doors \u00c2\u00a3 2,160 9 0 I I.. Season ttckets. 4 4 0 Total receipts \u00c2\u00a3 2,164 13 0 On Thursday, the Queen and the Prince again visited the Exhibition, with- the Prince of Wurtemberg and Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Coburg. The Royal visitors, entering at the door in Holland,\" proceeded up the foreign nave to the Russian compartment on the south side, and examined the stand devoted to the Russian seeds and fibrous- plants, of which there is a good selection. They then returned to the nave,, and, attended by M. de Sallandrouze, the French Com- missioner, wentlato the French fine art compartment on the north side. which her Majesty had already visited once before. The Royal party walked to the end of the gallery through the American compartment, and then went into the back avenue of the gallery, occupied by stained glass; after having, as they passed along, looked at the rich ecclesiastical costumes of Belgium and Austria. Her Majesty appointed an early hour on Saturday to view the rest of the depart- ment of Machinery. The number of visitors was as great as \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdindeed rather more than\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdit had been on the day before. Between twelve and one o'clock a very striking and gra- tifying incident occurred, the entrance of a body of nearly 800 yeomen And agricultural labourers, all looking clean and comfortable, most of them-in smock frocks, each bearing on- his breast a small rosette of coloured ribbon and evidently in some degree organised, and under regular guidance. Upon inquiry, it was found that these good folks (many of whom were, accompanied by their wives and children) had come up from three .'Ishes?Crowliurst, in Kent, and Linchfield and Lingford, in Surrey (near East Grinstead, in Sussex); and thatthey had for some months been subscrib- ing for the trip, under the auspices of the clergy. The arrangements had been made with such admirable economy that the total charge per head\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdincluding not only the con- veyance per rail, and a boat to Westminster bridge, but the shilling for admission-was only 3s. 2d.; that is to say, only 2s, 2d. for the expenses for travelling, of which the, railway company only charged Is. 6d. per head.. On Friday the price of admission was half-a-crown, and E2,206 5s. was the amount taken at the doors, the number of visitors being 24,520. The Duke of Devonshire has sent to the Crystal Palace a very remarkable contribution in the shape of a hawk, which is executed with great spirit, and studded all over with pre- cious stones. This object will no doubt attract great atten- tion, and will probably be placed in the nave, near the department of Holland. His Grace has also forwarded a magnificent snake-chain of silver filagree work, the design of which is singularly chaste and beautiful. Measures are to be at once adopted for allowing the hum- bler classes easy access to the model cottages of the Prince Consort The narrowness of the staircase renders it neces- sary to limit the number of visitors at a time, but no great practical difficulty is likely to arise from this. The ex-Queen of the French, accompanied by the Duchess of Orleans and several other members of the late Kings family, visited the Exhibition on Friday, and were chiefly ocs-l cupied in examining the industrial products of the country which they so lately ruled. It was an affecting sight to witness the respectful sympathy of manner with which they were received. M. Sallandrouze, with head uncovered, con- ducted them through the collection, and the Frenchmen present paid all suitable homage to the illustrious visitors. Our countrymen and women were hardly so polite, their curiosity collecting them in a dense mass round the strangers. 1, 1 It may be noticed as a feature of Friday's experience at the Crystal Palace, that the sale of season tickets, which had nearly ceased, realized E39 Iss. On Saturday morning the Queen an d Prince Albert re- sutned their examination of the interior-and their personal interviews with Exhibitors. The Norwich shawls, lace, and poplins, which are arranged in .thg south galleries of the transept, attracted the attention of the Royal party, and Her Majesty was pleased to make several purchases .here. These manufactures are well. worthy of, general notice, developing much skill and industry, and the poplins falling little if at all short of those from Ireland in quality. After some time spent in the examination of this part of the interior, the Jtoyal. party, waited upon by the Executive Committee, Mr. Fox,- Mr. Cubitt, and Mr. Hensrnan, resumed their survey of \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 the machinery in motion. The ingenious hydraulic apparatus of Mr. Armstrong, so admirably adapted for loading and un- loading goods, for lifting heavy weights, and for other pur- ioses connected with docks, ranges of warehouses, and such fik* ntst attracted, the attention?of the illustrious .works, should indeed 1)? seen by every one who goes to the Exhibition for instruction. Then came Mr. Appold's centrifugal pump, wift the wonderful performances of which the visitors of the Crystal Palace are now pretty familiar. The same iitfefntor shows opposite his machine for getting; up artificial onemdes, a less striking and less.utilitarian contribu-, tion afso, but one which has, nevertheless, a. peculiar merit aUa^hed to it, and which did not escape the observation of BttvMty. It is for regulating the labour of convicts in prison, ana is. so constructed that in no possible way can the task itniOS4 be either evaded or; become greater than was' in- tended.

As might have been expected, from the attractions of a review at Hounslow, there was a comparatively small atten- dance of 5s. vi. si t ors during the day-the receipts being si,634 17-i, and the police returns giving 14,102 as the num- ber of persons present. The sale of season tickets amounted lo \u00c2\u00a3 SS 14s. The gross receipts of the Commissioners up to Saturday night were \u00c2\u00a3 225,605 14s. The juries in the different sections are, we hear, on the whole, working most satisfactorily and amicably in making and completing tnetr awards. The Commission Will, it is 6aid, be extremely chary in the distribution of their first- class medals, givipg these tortly to contributions of the highest and most unquestionable merit, and reserving the second-class marks of distinction for the numerous examples of excellence with which in every branch of industry the whete collection abounds.. It is sincerely to be hoped that thior course may be found a successful antidote to those indi- vidual jealousies and disappointments which are so apt to spring up under such circumstances. The Exhibition would not. have received its highest sanction, or reached its loftiest aiDls, if awards had not been, made, and inventive genius r and artistIc taste crowned with their appropriate honours; yet it is extremely difficult to do- this effectually without at the same time unduly interfering with the ordinary course of trade and the hard-earned pre-eminence of leading firms. It | Wis the apprehension of this obstacle which induced many to I bbld back from and even oppose the whole undertaking, while others patronized it coldly, as men do those who they think may injure them and yet whom they are afraid to throw think may What an extraordinary thing, therefore, i? will be if the \u00c3\ufffddem of prizes is made to act satisfactorily after ill. It it does6 such a result must be mainly due to the good sense, the intelligence, and the impartiality of the body who, erairterit each 'in his own\u00c3\u00a9department of labour, have been from day to\" day quietly and systematically pursuing their varied Researches amidst the contents of the Crystal Palace. \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 .Additions have lirtely been made to the collection from Brazil. The articles consist pcincipally. of specimens of ,the raw prodttf4 of the country, and such coarse textile Citbrma as are to be found among semi-civilised races. .There are also cases of the various luscious fruits of the tropics, which are not in good preservation; and do not seem to have benefited by their long voyage. But the most peculiar feature in the consignment is the collection of pictures and vases of flowers all delineated with perfect truth of colouring. in feathers, plucked fiom the innumerable beautiful birds of the South American forests. This rare art, which was formerly practised in great perfection in Mexico, was sup- posed to have been lost with the destruction of the Aztecs, but it seems to have only migrated across the isthmus, and is now extensively and successfully practised at Rio. In the front of the Brazilian section stands a most beautiful vase of flowers in this material, contributed \"by Madame Duboise, of Rio, which has been there for some time, to serve as an avant courrier to the rest of the consignment.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Celestials are also getting their boutique much botter fiilished. Messrs. Lichart, of Canton and London, exhibit some beautiful Chi- nese curiosities. There are the wonderful ivory globes; sphere within sphere, which have so long been a puzzle, in great perfection. Funny-looking mandarins, in chene cisele, fishing with spiders (for bait) almost as big as themselves, -and several fine carvings in jade stone, most peculiar thinese. Then there is silver filagree as delicate as the spider's web a splendid inlaid loo table, supported upon the Chinese Dragon, which, like the Lion of-the Assyrians, appears to be the key to the emblematieallore of the country. The collec- tion of teas must not be forgotten, as they afford a fine oppor- tunity ibr comparing thi genuine article with the indigenous products of Essex; with which thanks to the patriotic feelings of our grocers, we have latterly, become familiar. The Bulletin de Paris says that M. Thiers has returned to Phris full of admiratibn for the wonders at the Exhibition. He spent nine days there, amongst the most eminent inanu- fcelurers and professional men, who, pleased to meet with so superior an intellect, gladly gave him every explanation.\" M. Thiers asserts .that there can be no dispute as to Ithe high position France holds at the Exhibition, especially ii her silk manufactures. He was struck with the fact that France is pre-eminent in all the at-tidea of luxury, which, nona but the wealthiest can buy; whereas England excels in the produc- tions usually consumed by the midlde knd poorer classes. Thus democratic France works for the riclr, .and anstofcratic England works for the poor. THE CRYSTAL PALACE A PEEMANENT BUILDING.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Athenmtm rfiturtis to the question of making the glass palace a permanent self-*suoporting Yxh-ibition:-The more our proposal to convert the Exhibition into a permanent galler of natural produce-and mechanical product is considered, the' more practicable it appears. Utiles# some such scheme for rendering it self-supporting be adopted) it also becomes .tTMy d?y 0_11' tb*t the CrYoW Ft?ce mWt come. 4owa. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bc 1na ill of such an edifice, devoted openly and solemnly as this* has\" been, in the face of all the world, to ends so truly catholic and noble,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdno reasonable yearly cost of repairs would pre- vent either of them from maintaining it in all its pride and beauty. But we are a practical nation, and our rulers cannot afford to indulge us in an expensive luxury-unless, perhaps, it were one out of which they could make political capital by their muuificenee. Downing Street does not subsidize thea- tres, support public gardens, found scientific institutions. The parks have been maintained because they are ancient royalties. A Palace in which neither younger brothers nor elderly dowagers can be lodged at the public expense is of no use to an English Minister. This sounds like satire,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdbut is simple truth. The Government, so far as we know, have made no change in their expressed determination to have nothing to do with the expenses of the Crystal Palace, pre- sent or future. On the other action and side; the governed, having obtained, by their own spontaneous liberality, an original structure, peculiarly English in its form and mate- rials, confessedly the most aerial and beautiful in Europe, are equally resolute not to permit its removal. We feel a strong assurance that it will be possible so to arrange matters that both parties to the contract may be satisfied\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat the people may retain their Industrial Palace, and the Govern- ment be relieved of every farthing of pecuniary responsibility. When we propose to retain, as a permanent gallery of nature and art, an edifice which, however beautiful, is generally supposed to have been raised under the idea that it would be taken down at the end of the year,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdit will be as well for us to state, once for all, that the Crystal Palace was not built as a temporary structure. That this was a stipulation in the bond we are aware\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdbut we believe we are perfectly correct in stating that the contractors, from the very first, thought and hoped that it would never be removed-and at a consi- derable sacrifice to themselves went so far beyond the letter of their bond as to erect a permanent structure where they were only required to erect a temporary one. The public have consequently got more for their money, than they had reason to expect-and to sell the work back again for what it cost them would be to make a bad bargain. If the Royal Commissioners will take the building on the terms already specified in their contract, and before laying down-their func- tions induce the Queen and Government to appoint a body of active and experienced Trustees for it,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwe think it can be shown very clearly that a considerable income might be ob- tained from it, without allowing it to be applied to any un- worthy purpose-more, in fact, than enough to pay all the expenses of repairs, renovations, and management, and leave a surplus to meet the demands of extraordinary years. As- suming, as we are justified in doing, that the physical fea- tures of the present Exhibition may be preserved, and a yet more ample development given to the departments of natural produce\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdespecially to those of floriculture and horticulture \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwe have already shown that from the most ordinary sources an income ranging between \u00c2\u00a315,000 to E50,000 a year might be calculated on. This estimate, based on the, probabilities of the case, is strengthened by a fact which has come to our immediate knowledge,-namely,. that an eminent contractor already proposes to offer E20,000 a year as rental for the use of the building, in addition to'keeping it in thorough repair. Such a thing as letting the people's palace, in the people's park, as a show room to a private individual, is, of course, not to be thought of seriously and we mention the circum- stance only to show that men of business, looking at the matter commercially, see the probability of the edifice being made not only to pay its expenses, but further to yield an ample revenue to the speculator. Some elements of the estimate on which such an offer might be based are open to all. A few inquiries, in the proper 'quarters, enable us to state that the cost of repairs, renovations, and decorations would not be more than from seven to eight thousand pounds a year for the next 20 years,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdindeed, on these terms, we believe a contract could be easily obtained, so as to put this item of expenditure out of the category of uncertainties. The cost of servants, police, superintendence, and so forth, would probably not carry this amount higher than \u00c2\u00a315,00Q or \u00c2\u00a3 20,000. This would be the entire outlay. On the other hand, there' are 30,000 present holders of season tickets, a great part of whom would probably renew their tickets at the year's end at a guinea each\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthere are nearly three millions of residents, foreigners, and provincial visitors in London every year, who are more or less sight-seers,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthere are various scientific associations and learned bodies which would be glad to hold special sittings in the bays or galleries of the Palace\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthere are many professors who, in all probability, would willingly pay fees for the privilege of giving courses of lectures within its walls\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthere are several popular and at- tractive Societies which, as we have reason to know, are anxious to transfer their annual or monthly \"exhibitions thi- ther. This immense constituency does not exhaust the sources of income which may be foreseen. We have been told that the various floricultural societies of London are de- sirous of arranging to hold thfeir Exhibitions in the splendid edifice\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand the income of these societies alone is said to be upwards E30,000 a year. All this gives an idea of the mag- nitude of the resources on which the supporters of a Uni- versal Gallery of natural' and human productions may rely fur the financial success of their scheme. Indeed, the possi- ble future uses of this magnificent show room-fitted for a world's Institute grow and multiply in the imagination more and more as we allow it to dwell on the matter. THE KOH-I-NOOR DIAMOND.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAfter all the work which has been made about that celebrated diamond, our readers will be rather surprised to hear that many people find a diffi- culty in bringing themselves to believe, from its external appearance, that it is anything but a piece of common glass. Amid all the adventures that have befallen it, there is, per- haps, none more odd than that its .genuineness should now be doubted. Yet so it is. The fact, is, that the Mountain of Light\" has been shockingly ;Il-used in the cutting, and that when placed- in the openr light of day, without any ar- rangements to draw forth its brilliancy, it does- npt sparkle and gleam like other jewels of the kind. To obviate this dis- advantage, and demonstrate to- the world that the Koh-i- Noor is a veritable diamond, it has surrounded with a canopy or tent, the interior of which is to be lighted with gas, and the idea is that this will develope its beauties as a gem of the purest water, with a certainty and splendour which undoubtedly are not attained at present.

{"ocr": "DISSERTATION ON QUERNS. By the Rev. A. HUME, LL.D. [On the previous evening, the discussion had turned to the subject of querns, from the notice of mills in the paper of the Rev. Mr. Jones, and from the fact that a curious one had been seen by the excursionists that day. The President expressed an anxiety to have some information on the general subject, and Dr. Hume volunteered such information as he possessed. He had described a (ittern at Liverpool nearly two years ago and though at a distance from sources of reference, would notice the results of his examination. On Thursday evening he stated that he had not been able to command a moment for the purpose of writing out his remarks; and with the consent of the Presi- dent and meeting, he proceeded to deliver them orally-] Bread\" the stait oflife\" is used by all nations more or less and therefore the mode of its preparation in r?us countries and at vanous times, becomes a ? ionX'ch interest. The history of the Qu?N ?u\"3 engrafted on a more general subject. A his- tory may be had geogmphicaUy as well ^chronologically lr ? \"f o?her words there are people in existence at this day in certain places, corresponding to almost rvd?e of civilization; so that facts of a primi- Sin? which are only traditional with ourselves, nre actual in barbarous countries. 1 The simplest mode of preparing grain for food is bv '< -n. or roaming it: in the former case it is soft- Ld in the 'a?r i?i. made bnttle. Both plans are ?c ised at present by the aborigines of America and of other countries. The Indians MY that parched corn sustains them best upon long journeys; the very food which we have reason to believe was given to Hagar when she was driven out by Abraham. By these modes of preparation, corn and bre id are almost synon- vmous terms; and as such we find them frequently \\lscl1. Thus, when the Egyptians came to buy\" corn they said give us \"bread;\" the sowing of seed after irrigation is expressed by cast thy bread upon the waters;\" and the ordinary crop is divided into seed for the sower and bread for the eater.\" o. A degree of advancement is the trituration by stoncs, In New Mexico, the maize is beaten on a broad stone by a smaller one like a painter's muller. It is beaten again if necessary; then the dough is kneaded and the cakes are baked on the sand stone. 3 Next in order came the pestle and mortar. These as we find from the Mosaic narrative were used by some of the Israelites, while others used the mill\" (quern,) It is probable that the poorer and more ignorant used the simpler instrument. It is not necessary to inter that the pestle was used at a much later period, when the expression occurs, bread corn is bruised. .1. The next step in advance was the use of the QUERN and ttlig is the chapter in the history of the preparation of food, which is now to be read in some I. STRUCTURE OF THE consists of two stones, round or nearly round; about two feet in diameter, but varying from 12 to an inches. The upper is from two to seven inches deep: the lower may be of any size or depth, as it may be a perfect fixture. In general, however, it did not extend nine inches, and was of such a size as to he readily remove- able, The top of the lower was often made convex, and the bottom of the upper concave there was thus no danger of their sliding, and the meal generally sub- sided to the edges. Sometimes the two contiguous surfaces were scored, in various patterns, to increase the action on the grain. ?' Tue?rn' wa? usually turned by a vertical handle inserted in the upper stone but occasionally it was inserted at the side. In the Saxon quern at Liverpool, there is reason to believe that a small crowbar was inserted at the side, and pushed round by a man. Occasionally the upright handle was elongated, and placed in a crowbar above, to give a small amount of leverage in the process of turning. Sometimes the upper stone was made to sit within a ledge of stone at the circumference of the lower; sometimes this ledge was of wood or metal. In any case it was necessary to have a hole at the side, for the ready egress of the meal. Sometimes the machine was worked on a table or bench; but more usually it was placed on the floor, with a cloth underneath, on which the meal fell as it was ground. The lower stone was sometimes made of a harder material, at least it was harder by supposition; and hence the expression of Job, \"harder than the nether millstone.\" [It appeared that in the actnal quern seen that day at Barmouth, the stones were of different materials and of differing degrees of hard- iiess.] The upper stone was usually provided with an iron bar across the hole or \"eye;\" and in the centre of this the pivot of the lower stone was placed. By wadding with small pieces of leather, any degree of fineness could be given to the meal. II. HISTORY. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd We read that Abraham directed Sarah to \"M?e fm?y <?<;? three wM?M??o/' fine ?e?. knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.\" Also the patriarch having selected a calt gave it to a young man, and he hastened to dress it\" Here is the divi- sion of labour as practised in the East still; the man is the butcher, the woman the miller and baker. Sarah is directed both as to quantity and kind and it is pro- bably that she used the pestle, as we find it in use 500 years after. We have evidence of two kinds that the quern was used by the ancient Egyptians. The one is, that the illustrations of domestic manners which have been brought to light by recent researches among the an- cient monuments, contain the process of grinding, in the manner about to be described. The other is the evidence of Moses in an incidental allusion. I he first born was to be destroyed, from the first-born of Pha- raoh that sitteth upon the throne, from the first-born of the maid-tenant that is behind the mill.\" Subsequently, the same instrument was used by the Greeks; and it is said that Pittacus, one of the seven wise men, had been used to turn the quern handle. In subsequent ages, the women imagined that that fact gave dignity to their employment, and lightened their labour by singing\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Grind, grind away mill, Pittacus too was grinder.\" The Romans used the quern, and beautiful speci- mens of Roman workmanship are turned up from time to time in almost every part of the country which they inhabited. th}1Iiiet Britons and the Saxons also made use of it, as numerous existing specimens testify, which are identified with one or other class of people-mainly from locality, but partly from construction. It is among the Celtic population that we find the quern still. It is used in the Highlands of Scotland, in Kerry, the county of Connaught, and a few other parts of Ireland; nor is it quite extinct, though per- 1 haps less known, in Wales. But even in purely Saxon districts, as the lowlands of Scotland and the north of Ireland, the generation is scarcely passed away, which saw it in current use. The preyhaired chroniclers used to tell how a smart housewife would reap the oats from the ridge, separate the grain from the straw, winnow, dry, grind, and sift the meal, and then make it into porridge in time for the breakfast of the family and workmen. Ill. I,OCALITY.Travelleri tell us that handmills of stone are used in China; and we know in a similar way that they are extensively used in preparing the simple food of the Hindoo over India. In the coun- tries which are called by way of eminence the east,\" as Egypt, Arabia, Persia, Asiatic Turkey, its existence is F nowii. In almost every country in Europe,- probably in all without exception, it is found either as an antiquity or an existing implement. Among the negro natwns it is common, in Central or Western Africa. Thus we can trace it almost from Japan on the east to Galway on the west. Of its existence m America, nothing definite could be stated. Probably Mr. Catlin's interesting work notices it. The quern was mostly used in the \"ill cowllrics for the two following reasons :-(I) Where grain is small in quantity there is economy of time, and increased convenience. The qitern is to the mill, wnat the flail is to the threshing machine, the spade to the plough, the sa(ldle horse to the railway train, the spinning wheel to the linen or cotton factory. There are many cases in which this simple instrument is decidedly the more desirable.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd(2) The nature of the country, Loads of grain are not easily dragged over steep hills; and what must the difficulty have been in the days of bridle-roads, and pack-horses. And how great is it even now, when the floods are out on the hills covered with snow. Dr. Johnson, in his tour in the Hebrides, mentions that in part of the isle of Skye, the people used the public mills when convenient, but their do- mestic querns in case of difficulties like these. IV. Moor, OF USING.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdTwo persons usually sat on the ground with the quern between them; and each used one hand in turning, and the other in filling the \"eye\" or hopper in the upper stone. In pictorial illustrations of Scripture, the women are generally represented as kneeling or leaning over the quern but it is easy to see that that is an unnatural position, as only a portion of the strength could he employed. The process of grinding was usually regarded as heavy work, probably like turning a mangle or grind- stone with ourselves; it was therefore reserved for slaves or mere drudges. This was Sampson s employ- ment after his capture by the Philistines-\" he did grind in his prison bouse.\" The contrast between g,- i d in his lr i soii I,o,ic Pharaoh on his throne, and the maid servant behind the mill, shows that the latter occupied the meanest position and in the complaint of Zion which con- cludes the Lamentations, it is said, they took the young men to grind.\" T lie 'Iosaic law I)i-oliil,ite(I V. LAWS ANI) CUSTOMS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Mosaic law prohibited any one from taking either the upper or the nether millstone to pledge, for he taketh a man s life to pledge.\" This was a humane enactment, and pre- vented advantage being taken of man's necessity or thoughtlessness. In modern times kings monopolised the grinding of grain, and one enacts that any one \"quliilk sail grind wheit maistlock beir or rye sajif at ye Kyng's wilue he sail tyue his wilue perpetuallie.\" Subsequently this monopoly was granted to individuals, and within a certain district, called the sucken\" or soken\" every one was obliged to grind, and to pay the usual toll or \"mulcture,\" caUed in Scotland\" tliirliage.\" But this law did not prevent any one from grinding at home, and for family use. To secure the entire trade, and literally to draw grist to the mill,\" the millers waged a warfare of extermina- tion against the quems. Some were purchased, and some I obtained surreptitiously: and in every case the upper stone was broken, and thus the pair destroyed. Numer- ous fragments might be found upon the surface or dug up near the olden wind and water mills. P The mille: was an important person in the rural district or a small village. In our old Englinh literature, especi- ally in the village poetry, he is represented as moderately wealthy, strong and hale and not unfrequently he figures in connexion with the fair sex. The description of the miller by Chaucer, in the Canterbury Tales, is so minute, and has such an air of individuality about it, that the poet must have had some person in view when he wrote it. The miller was a stout carl for the nones, Fal big he was of brawn and eke of bo-ies. He bore away the ram in wrestling, could heave a door off the bar, \"or break it at a renning w'*h his neiUS he had red hair, a peculiar wart upon his nose, and his beard was dressed broad in the shape of a spade. He was also musical, \"A baggepipe wel could he blow and soune, And therewithal he brought us onto of toune,\" The quem is still used in respectable families in Ire- land as a curiosity. The first grain of the season is ground in it, and the servants who work it sing extempore stanzas appropriate to the individuals of the family. The first is concerning the master, then the mistress, the visit- ers, the children, &c. Wooden querns, with or without pieces of tin grater attached, are still used for grinding spices, and a small stone is in the museum, apparently the upper one of a quern for a similar puipose. ALLUSIONS TO THE QUEHN. > It is not a little curious tnai me of the scriptures distinguish between the two stones; where our less perfect translation gives the common term mill-stone. The upper was known among the ancients as the\" rider,\" the lower as the ass. Thus we are told that \"a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone (rider) upon Abimilech s head, and all to (thoroughly) brake his skull,\" and again, it were better for him that a millstone (ass millstone) were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. A translation of the Scriptures by AVickliff, in the early part of the fourteenth century, contains the fol- lowing version of a well-known passage Tweine wymmen shu)en ben gryndinge in 0 querne; oon schal be takon and the tothir left.\" In the Book of Hevelation, desolation is shown by the sH(mce of mt icia?s and cm'tsme! and it is added \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in her.\" Figurative allusions to grinding are found in the Pook of Job (xxxi. 11)), and in Ecclesiastes (xii). The latter passage is the following. The keepers of the house (hands and arms) shall tremble, and the strong men (legs and back) shall bow themselves, and the grinders (teeth) cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows (eyes) be darkened. And the doors shall be shut in the streets (lips and hollow cheeks) when tbe sound of the grinding is low.\" The following are other illustrations from our own literature \"Whereas they made him at the quern grind Ah nobil Sampson, strongest of mankind.

An interesting anecdote, illustrative at once of feelings of humanity, and of the use of the quern in Africa, is that recorded by Mungo Park. When he had turned his horse loose for the night, and with hi,; sa,ldle and hri,lle had taken shelter in a tree himself, from the wild beasts, he was prevailed upon by a poor negress to enter her hut, and was most kindly and hospitably entertained. During the evening, while her daughters snun cotton, they extemporised a song applicable to himself, It has been versified almost in Park s own words. The loud winds roared, the rains fell fast, The white man yielded to the blast; He came and sat beneath our tree, For weary, sad, and faint was he. CHORUS.

{"ocr": "THE QUEEN S BIRTH-DAY IN LONDON. The Anniversary of her Majesty's Birth-day was observed in London on Saturday in such a manner, as no similar celebration was ever observed before. The day was a general holiday, and was hailed with liie same degree of reverence amongst the lowest as it was amongst the highest of the land. The stranger in the metropolis, anxious to see all that could be seen on so interesting an occasion, rushed at an early bour to the usual inspection of the household troops on the Parade m St. James's-park, where lie found a very numerous and fashionably dressed assemblage of both sexes, full of excitement and animation. Shortly afterwards Prince Albert arrived, in the uniform of the Scotch Fusilier Guards, accompanied by the Duke of Saxe Cobourg Gotha, the Duke Ernest of Wurtemberg, and the Prince of Leiningen. The Prince, his numerous and brilliant stalt; the illmtrious Commander-in-Chief, together with Lord Combermere and other distin- guished officers, returned to the palace, alter the parade, about eleven o'clock. A cab and the railwav soon transferred the visitor from this scene of gaiety and delight to the beautilul common at Woolwich, where there was a congregation of a countless multitude, llulldreds of carriages tilled with the Nile and most fashionable of society, amongst whom we noticed the Earl of t ardigan, Larl of Lx- bridge, the Ladies l'agd, l'aroll Parke and his daugh- ter, many others were permitted to be drawn up near the flag staff opposite the Cadets College. Shortly before twelve the troops came upon the ground. 1 list came three battalions of the ltoya! I'oot Artillery, and two batteries of seven guns each, preceded by then splendid band, and the gentlemen cadets; then the Sappers and .Miners, with their band; the Hoyal \\Ia, rines, and their hand; the Greenwich and Deptford division of Pensioners, with their drums and fifes. 1 he whole having formed in a lille, one of the batteries occupying the centre, four troops of the Hoyal Horse or Flying Artillery, with batteries of guns Irl.ive(l, andI took up a position oil the summit of the hill. The line 11 regiment of the lith Lancers, with its band, followed, j and was drawn up in a line with the infantry, i he | field officers in charge of the artillery were Lieut.-C ol. | Bell, Lieut.-Col. Breton, and Brigadier-Major Bing- ham. The Lancers were under the command of Lieut.- Col. Lawrence, the Duke \"f Cambridge, the eolOlwl of I the regiment, being absent at the drawing-room; the j Sappers and Miners, under Capt. Frith; the Iloyal Marines hy Colonel M'Adam, and the pensioners by j Major Forbcs. Altogether the number of troops on the ground amounted to near]y ;),000, A few minutes before one, Field-Marshal the Marquis of Anglesey, Master-General of the Board of Ordnance, accompa- nied by Sir Thomas Daunani, the Commandant of the garrison, Earl of Cardigan, who was attired as colonel of the 11th Iiiissitrs, and a brilliant staff of officers, rode up, and were received with due honours. The manoeuvring commenced by the centre firing a salute of twenty-one gnn\" which was taken up by tlle 11 rse Artillery battery on the lull, and the Foot Artillery on the left of the field; the whole line of troops then fired a feu ilejoie. At thc conclusion the 8e\\'em] bands strnck up the National Anthem, and the troops ;O(?? off their caps, and gave three loud and enthusiastic cheers, a display of loyalty which was heartily respon- ded to by thousands that'flanked every quarter of the field. The Marquis of Anglesey, accompanied by the commandant ail id staff, then rode down the front of the hlle, and r evi e, e(I the several regiments. Afterwards the troops divided in open columns, and marched past the staff, preceded by their several bands, and colours j flying. The infantry then filed off. and the Iloyal j llore and Foot Artillery, witli t I, e 1 /1n dancers, made several brilliant charges, greatly to the admiration of all assembled. Other manoeuvring followed, ami tho review, after occupying more than two hours, termi- nated. The whole passed off with the greatest hlfll. A crush through a dense crowd on the pier, a trip to Blackwall, and a hasty white-bait dinner at Lovegrove's, having been disposed of, a journey on the railway and a cab brought us again to St. James's- palace, just before her Majesty's Drawing-room was emptied of its noble and splendid The dresses of the ladies displayed a taste, an ele- j gance, and a variety exceedingly difficult to describe for though a court dress has certain peculiar charac- teristics which may not be infringed, yet siill it has been, and is much varied, according to the taste of the wearer. Those who recollect the court of George the Fourth, must remember the manner in which the fea- thers of the head-dress were worn then. The plume rose perpemlicularly from the back of the head to a great lieight-to the height of or even three feet, and the feathers were often so numerous and large, that the weight of the plume was a serious inconvenience to the wearer. Now feathers are uni- versally worn on one side of the bead, adapting them- selves to the form, and rarely exceeding one 01' two in number, and the influence of modern fashion has pro- duced other slight modifications. Artificial flowers were worn on the opposite side of the feather, and often produced a very elegant combination and it was impossible not to be stiuc k with the extreme beauty :So\u00c2\u00a1;)enst f ii:)k ti:lt: e\u00c2\u00a1illes;:u: these flowers exhibited. These were so general that, with the exception now and then of a tiara or bandeau of jewels, of extraordinary magnificence and value, they might be said to be worn by every lady present. Brocaded silks were very general, and some were of extraordinary beauty; but these were worn by the matronage of the country. The demoiselles werr generally in a simpler material, and of one colour. Velvet dresses were to be seen certainly, but very few and far between, though the introduction of velvet in the head-dress, as a ground for jewel\". had an excellent tiect, ami was in many instances adopted. The dress of the gentlemen offers but little field for remark. The ol'tlie ,,ciitleiiieti ofiers I)iit little t iel(I for rciiiark. 'flic the official, royal and connty Sl'nices being varied now and then by thosc of foreign Powers. Among thrsc the uniforms of the cavalry of the Grand Duke of Hesse attracted notice from its soldierly and and ser- vice-like character. Occasionally, too, might be seen the court dress, par excellence\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda gentleman who was neither in the militia, the yeomanry, or a deputy licn, tenant of a coiiiity-a pure civilian\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin a dress, which, after the lapse of a few more years, may not improperly be ternwd the costume of the time of George the Third. With the exception of onc or two of these coats being composed of velvet, there was nothing to relieve this dress of any of its severe original forma- Ility, The doors of the palace were thrown open at one o'clock, and long before the arrintl of her Majesty at St. James's, the largest of the suite of reception rooms, the tapestry chamber, and the anti-room were filled, and in a short time afterwards the staircase and corridor were crowded. In this state of things the ladies had nothing else to do but to carry the guard-j room of the Yeomen of the Guard, where they esta- blished themselves, and remained until the passage of those who were before them to the presence of the Queen left them room enough to emerge into the state apartments. Her Majesty arrived at St. James's Palace from Buckingham Palace, with her usual pune- tuality, precisely at two o'clock, and was received, on j her arrival at the garden gate of the palace, by the band of the 2nd Life Guards with the National Ali- them. The first proceeding after her Majesty's arrival was the reception of the bishops in the royal closet, when his Grace the ?ti-c-libisliol) of' Caiitei-b?ii-v, as the spiri- J tual head of the National C hurc h, delivered, on behalf of his episcopal brethren and his own, a congratulatory address on the auspicious event, which the day was set apart specially to celebrate, and which was most gra- ciously acknowledged by her Majesty. The Queen and Prince Albert, surrounded by the Duke of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Saxe Coburg Gotha, the Duke Ernest of Wurtemberg, Prince Henry of the Netherlands, the Prince of Liningen, and Prince Edward of Saxe Weimar, then entered the Throne Room, and took their station in front of the Throne. Her Majesty's dress was white\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe material silk, beautifully embroidered with silver it was trimmed with silver blonde, and ornamented with diamonds. The petticoat was of white satin, with tulle and white satin ribbons. The head dress was diamonds and fea- thers, and a wreath of blue corn flowers. In all the State receptions this year the Queer, has generally worn some flower or blossom which was either an emblem of the season, or in bloom at the time and at this, the last and crowning State reception of this season, the blue corn flower was worn by her Majesty, for this flower was not only worn as a wreath fo I' the head- dress, but also ornamented the train. Immediately after the Queen had taken her station the doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, aud the representa- ti\\'es of ltU3sia, Spain, America, France, Austria, lid- gium, Holland, Denmark, Prussia, Sweden, Portugal, Mexico, and Turkey, attended by their secretaries and numerous attaches, approached and paid their respects to her Majesty and his Royal Highness Prince Albert. The Cabinet Ministers, Commander-in-chief, official and state functionaries, and all those among the nobility to whom the Queen is pleased to accord the privilege of the entree, followed after the corps diplomatique in paying their loyal and dutiful respects to her Majesty, and so numerous was this \"irele that it almost amount- ed to an ordinary drawing-room. After these had re- tired the general company, till now crowded in the outer rooms, were admitted to the presence of her Nfii- jesty and her illustrious circle. The reception altogether occupied two hours. It is extremely dilKcult to select any among such a mass of beautiful dresses; nevertheless there were some, from either their novelty, their richness, or their elegance, which attracted the eye more than others.

Last week the responsible editor of one of them, the Pouvoir, was brought to the bar of the Chamber, and fined. But within a few days afterwards, a still more vio- lent attack appeared in the Momtcur du Soir, and the Chamber hesitates to fine the Monitcw. The French have not yet discovered the way to lubricate, by the oil of mutual concession and forbearance, the jarring mechanism of Representative Government. From Paris we learn that the Juge de Paix of the 2nd arrondissement decided, on Monday, that M. Thiers is entitlell to have his name inscribed on the electoral list. The Repub'ician de Lot et de Garonne, the most violent of the Socialist papers, has been obliged to cease appearing for want of lumls.

DKLGIU.M.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe nineteenth anniversary of the in- auguration of King Leopold was celebrated at Brussels on Sunday with the usual ceremonies. All the public buildings and a great many private houses were decorated wi h the national flag, and the bells of all the c'mrches were rung. The Kinn and Queen att-nded a Te Del/Ill which was cliaunted in the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudule: they were accompanied to ar.d from church by a military escort, and, en arriving, were received by the clergy ot the cathedral, and conducted by them in pro- cession to the throne. The church was decked out as on grand religious and national occasions. The diplomatic corps, and honse officers of every degree, swelled the mul- titude with their presence; and in the evening a grand illumination followed. 0 AUSTRIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Government at Vienna have acknow- ifdgodthe receipt ol a copy 0t the treaty concluded by Pru-sia with Denmark on behalf ol the German Confedei- a io.i, but requires that it should be submitted for ratifica- tion to the proper l ederal authority. It is only as a member of the Confederation, and by virtue of acts which have implicated the Cnnlederatiou, that Austria is at war with Denmark at all and for this reason she disclaims to give her individual ratincation to a treaty of peace. PRUSSIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The celebrated German divine, Dr. Augustus Neauder, well known in this country through the translations of his Church History and other works, died at Berlin on the lltlMnstant, iu his 62nd year. He was Upper Consistorial Councillor, and since 1843 P10- fessor of Divinity at the University of Berlin, and one of the chief promoters of the changes operated in the Pro- testant Establishment of 1 russia, and of the compromise of the Lutheran and Camnistic Confessions in the so-called United Church. DENMARK. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd lhe expected collision between the Danish troops and the rebellious gatherings of Germany to throw off the allegiance due to the Crown of Denmark, from the Duchies ot Schleswig and Holstein, took place on Thursday week, which, after a bloody and hard-fought battle ended in the total defeat of the rebels by the Dan- ish General Von Krogh:- \"The Danish army having advanced southward along the great road which follows the eastern coast so far as Flensburg, and thence strikes across the open country to Schleswig, had arrived within a few miles of the ground where the Ilolstein troops, who had occupied the line of positions recently evacuated by the Prussians, lay. waiiiug their approach in an attitmle of defence. General Williseu appears to have fallen into the error of unduly extending his line ot battle\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda mistake rendered doubly hazardous by the character of the country, which is flat, intersected by streams, crossed in every direction by high hedges and deep lanes, with here and there patches of moorland and marshy ground. His ngut, under Colonel Von der Horst (like q himself, a Prussian volunteer), was posted between the road and the sea his left, under Colonel Von der Tann, a Bavarian officer of chivalrous courage and equal impetuosity, held the fords of the little river Treeue whdst the centre, commanded by the General-in-Chief in person, was pushed forward to Idstedt, a village on the Flensburg road, blocking the line of advance on the hostile column. \u00c2\u00ab On the 'Hth, General Von Krogh executed two utrong re- connoissances in order to ascertain the strength and position of his adversary, which the nature of the ground rendered it diffi- cult to discover; and some sharp skirmishing took place, prin- cipally in the direction of the Treene, which seems to have misled Willisen into an idea that it was the great object of the Danes to turn his left flank by way of Ilusum. Having completely effected his purpose, the Danish commander prepared for a general attack on the following morning. Soon after daybreak, the engagement began by an attack upon the left wing of the Holsteinanny, which was hotly engaged for several hours, the Danes eventually retiring in good order, and drawing after them the impetuous Von der Tann, who thus became completely se- parated from the main body. Having thus dislocated the enemy's line and further drawn off his attention by a feint on the right. General Von Krogh threw his whole weight upon the hostile centre now weakened by the reinforcements which had been despatched to support the wings. The Ilolsteiners, who are reported to have fought with the greatest gallantry, stood the brunt of several successive attacks, lasting until nearly three in the afternoon, when the centre broke, and the line giving way at every point, the whole army fell back, hastily put in tolerable order closely pursued by their victorious adversaries. The Danes entered Schleswig in the course of the evening, occupied successively Eckernforde and Folkenburg, and by the morning of the 2Gth they were undisputed masters of the whole country within four or live miles of the Eyder.\" The details from which the Chronicle gathers the pre- ceding accounts are almost entirely German, and of course favourable to the insurgents, so that no doubt remains, but that the victory has been most decisive for the Danes. The same authorities state the numbers on the field to have been\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdDanes 38,000, Germans 29,000, and about 3000 killed on each side. The whole of several Schleswig bat- talions were utterly destroyed. We have no more authentic accounts ot the numbers engaged at the battle of Idstedt at present than we have published in our usual Foreign summary. It is now said that upwards of 10.00J fell on both sides, the German accounts, of course, representing the greater portion of the loss to have been on the side of the Danes. On the 26t\\J, the Danish General had offered a truce of three days to General Willisen, which, however, he had refused, and the Danish troops had advanced within a few Uliles of the Fyder, to Cropp, but up to 4 P.M. on the 27th, had not crossed the river. General illiscn is concentrating his forces in a central position, which, with some additional Ilolsteiners, still amount to 30,000 men. The General is fully prepared for another effort to retrieve his lost honour. ITALY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Pope has ordered the celebration of a Universal Jubilee, in commemoration of his restoration to his dominions. The time is to be fixed by the Bishops themselves in different parts of the world; it is to last fifteen days, and carry plenary indulgence of one hundred years for each separate accomplishment of the set of devo- tional excrcises to be prescribed by the Bishops in their several dioceses. Mr. Charles Waterton appears in the Tablet to throw light on the asserted miraculous movement of the picture at Rinnui. lie writes I visited Rome in 1\u00c2\u00ab47, and being anxious to know all about the pictures which had moved their eyes in the eventful times of 179G-7, I got introduced by the late Sir Thomas Gage, of Hengrave, to a geutteinan every way qualified to meet my inquiries. He was a Professed Father of the Society of Jesus, and was noted for his great piety and superior talents, lie took me to the picture which hung at the Archetto, a little archway aflord- iug a passage from one street to another. At the time we reached the place, there were some twenty people on their knees, praying before the picture. As my com- panion iu saccrdotal dress, I had no apprehensions that our apparent intrusion would be taken in an improper point of view. So, we respeetfSully passed them all, and we went quite clos. up to the picture; and the Professed Father said, that in 1790, having brought a pair of compasses with bin), he placed therg 94. the eyo if tta \u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a1Ill) tie p*e e^fcali, move be)\"ond the point of the compasses, first to the right and then back again to the left, and that he nude this experiment several tinws on several days.\" TURKEY\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA letter from CoDs'an'inople, of the 9th, states that M. de Lamartine and his two companions, MM.

UNITED STATES. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The Europa brings more de- tailed information of the death of President Taylor than we were enabled to give last week. The immediate causp of death was dysentery, which he had contracted in the Mexican war, and was nearly carrying him off last season. He wa.s buried in the Congressional hurying-ground a Washington. The funeral was largt>, solemn, and apprn- priate, attended by the Cabinet, Congress, all the officers of the Government, the foreign ministers, a large military force, a\"d an imnieuse concourse of citiz ns, thousands of whom had travelled from the large cities to pay the last sad tribute of respect to their beloved chief magistrate. From twelve to three o'clock in all towns the shops and stores were closed, and business entirely suspended. Never was national sorrow more general or more sincere. The fo lowing is a brief sketch of his career: \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd \"Zaehary Taylor was born in Virginia, in the year 178(5. His father, Colonel Taylor, a distinguished soldier of the war 01 Independence, removed from Virginia into Kentucky when his son was still all infant; and so it happened that the latter was reared in the veritable back woods of a border state. As the son of a farmer, he had much work with his hands and lej;s an\u00c3\u00b9 little with his mind; and thus the framework of a vigorous and cli ar-heailed manhood was compacted. Through the influ- ence of his rclativp, Piesident Madison, he obtained a lieuten- ancy in the United States Army in 1808; and one of his first exploits was the remarkable defence of Fort Ilarr'non against great odds; a feat which, as it protected along frontier from devastation, immediately made his name famous in the Repub- lie. in later years the Florida warfare exhibited his stead) sdf, rcliancp, his varied and rapid resource, and his power ol combined strategy. The greatest successes of Irs Mexican campaign, in operation with inferior means, against a greatly superior enemy, over a vast extent of territory, are fresh in the memory both of America and Europe, where his chief pxpluits were gaining the following battles:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAlay 8, 1846, l'ulo Alto, 2,100 Americans, 6,000 Mexicans; May 9, llessaca de la l'alma same forces; September 21 and 22, Monterey (battle and siege) 5,000 Americans, 12,000 Mexicans; February 22,1847, Buen\" Vista, 5,000 Americans, 20,000 Mexicans. On his return from Mexico his friends successfully put forward his claim to the Presidency. He was nominated as the Whig candidate, but soon disavowed any merely sectional support, and declared VI his fellow citizens that he should try to be President uf the American people.' His il.tc generous character awakened per- sonal respect everywhere, awl he was chosen ia November, 1848, by a large majority of the national voices.\" On the 4th of March, the following year, General Tay- lor was inaugurated as President of the United States, the Honourable Millard Fillmore being Vice-President. General Taylor was President only a few days more than sixteen months; and on his death Mr. Fillmore, according to the constitution, assumed the office of chief magistrate of this republic. The new President has risen from the humblest classes. He was born of parents farmers, but with small means, January 7, 1800. \"The narrow means of his father deprived Millard Fillmo 0 of any advantages of e\u00c3\u00b9ucation beyond what were afforded by the imperfcct and ill-taught common schools of the country, Books were scarce and dear, and at the age of fifteen, when more favoured youths are far advanced in their classical studies, or enjoying in colleges the benefit of well-lurnished libraries, young Fillmore had read hut little except his common school books and the Bible. At that period he was sent into the wilds of Livinston county, to learn the clothiers' trade. He remained there about four months, and was then placed with another per- son to pursue the same business and wool carding in the town where his father lived. A small village library that was formed there soon after gave him the first means of acquiring general knowledge through books, lie improved the opportunity thus olfered the appetite grew by what it thus fed upon. The thirst for knowledge soon became iitsatiate, and every leisure moment was spent ill reading. At the age of nineteen he became acquainted with the lute Judge Wood, a man of wealth aud great business capacity, who had an excellent law library. lie soon saw that under the rude exterior of the clothier's boy were powers that only required exterior of the clothier's boy were powers that only required proper development to raise the possessor to distinction and usefulness, and advised him to quit his trade and ,tudy law. Judge Wood offered to advance money to defray his expenses, and wait until success in business should furnish him the means of repayment. The offer was accepted. Fearing he should incur too large a debt to his benefactor' he taught in a school for three months in the year, and thus acquired the means of partially suppurting himself. In the spring of 1823 he was admitted tu the Common l'leas, and comnu*ZK-ed practice in the of Aurora, where he re- mained until 1830, when he removed to liufl'.ilo.\" The New York correspondent of the Times says:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd He commenced life ns a schoolmaster, then attained dis- tinction at the bar, has since been Comptroller of the Treasury of New York; and has represented the State in both houses of Congress. His views Oil financial matters are said to be pecu- liarly clear, aud when called upon last year to explain himself on the givat question now at issue iu the country, the opinions which he set forth were anything but ultra; for. though can- didly avowing that he looked on slavery as an evil, he as openly deefared that he considered its present existence a* not a sub. ject for the legislation of the General Uovernmcnt.\" WEST INDIES. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA letter from Port Spain, Tiinidad, dated June 18, say\" \"Our amiable and good governor, Lord IImis, is to leave the island in a few days, in conformity with the orders Irom the Home Government, which has commanded him to repair with all possible dispatch to Canada, there to assume an l exerei.-e the ruling power of British North, America, rice Lord E'gui re- called.

{"ocr": "SLAVERY IN AMERICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdHER CLERGY AT THE GREAT EXHIBITION. In a recent debate in the House of Representatives at Washington, the Hon. Joshua R. Giddings, in referring to (he late Fugitive Slaves Bill,\" made the following comparison between Protessor Webster, who was executed last Angus: at Boston, and the Hon, Daniel Webster, Secretary of State Sir.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd^1 was about to make some comparisons, but perhaps they may be regarded as indelicate. During last summer two distinguished gentlemen of the same name occupied much of the public attention. One was said to have committed murder, and the other to have procured the passage of this law one was hanged for his crime the other for his efforts, was taken into the cxccutivc ca- binet. One destroyed the life of an individual, the other contributed his efforts for the passage of this law, which must consign hundreds, perhaps thousands, to premature graves. I, sir, cannot speak for others; but, for myself, I would rather meet my final Judge with the guilt of him who has gone to his accouut, than of him who now sits in yonder cabinet! Language such as this, uied at so early a period of the Congressional Sessions, gives little colour to the assertion of tuc political press of the United States, and reiterated by the Corresponuent of the Times,\" that the agitation upon this fearful law is subsiding. \u00c2\u00bb \u00c2\u00ab C,,\u00c2\u00a113 for philanthropic measures in this kingdom are so numerous, that those who are really devoting themselves to the removal of the evils aronnd us, may be excused if they consider the American slaves as too remote, and his his too local for him to be benefited by their aid, yet Britain has always boasted a considerable number of ardent friends of the oppressed negro-many whose hearts, even now. day and night, are weighed down by dwelling upon his wrongs, and who, with John Wesley, look upon American slavery as the I- sum of all villanies.\" And when was there an occasion more urgent than the present for English \"sympathy and exertion in the work of eman- cipation ? In Scotland the friends of the slave have been for some time up and doing; they have held meetings to give expression to their sentiments upon the Fugitive Slave Law.\" A considerable number of ministers of the Scottish churches have taken part in the proceedings and while the horrors of American slavery fully depicted and reprobated, and the iniquity of tile\" Fugitive Slave Law'' was exposed to indignant audiences, the tremendous fact was prominently brought into view that the vast amount of injustice, cruelty, and crime perpetrated by the slave system of the United States was not only sanctioned, but fostered and maintained in existence bv the professed Chsistian ministers and churches of that country. Of this lamentable truth those versed in the history of American slavery have always been too well aware but the late cruel law is now giving to it a startling pre- eminence. It is worthy of particular remark that the conduct of the American clergy in the free states, in reference to slavery, has always beeu the reflection of the public opinion upon that subject; whether for right or for wrong, they have followed, but have not led the national sentiment. As the public have felt, the pulpit has spoken. The Protestant Episcopal Church has not shown the inconsistency which marked the course of the other re- ligious organizations of the United States. It never evinced any sympathy with the slave, and boasts of not having been disturbed by the anti-slavery agitation. Several of their Churches are under coloured ministers, of great talent and unquestioned integrity but the Epis- copal convention has steadily refusad to a-Imit them into its body. Though the efforts of the American government to extend and perpetuate slavery by the addition of 25,000 square miles of new slave soil from the free territory ate ) conquered from Mexico, and by passing the Fugitive ave aw, have increased the anti-slavery agitation, and y 11 have compelled many conscientious members of the dif- ferent religious organizations to join the ranks of the Abolitionists, the Churches themselves, with trifling exceptions, have evinced little sympathy for the oppressed: 00 contrary, they seem more zealous than ever to follow j public opinion in supporting slavery, upjn the j pica that, if it be interfered with, the continuance of the Union will be endangered. At the recent meetings in Scotland, the evil influences of the so-called Christianity of America upon tht endea- vours to abolish slaverry were shown by many unques- tionable examples. In further evidence of the power of the church in main- taining American shvery, the following table, published by the Rev. VV. G. Keppait, of the American Missionary Association, is quoted:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Slaves. The Mchodists hold \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2\u00e2\ufffd\u00a2\u00e2\ufffd\u00a2\u00e2\ufffd\u00a2\u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 219,56;} Presbyterians (old and new school) 77,00n Baptists 125,000 Uimpbellites 101,000 nPvfC\u00c2\u00b0r\\i,lans 88,000 Other Denominations 50,000 o a by ministers of Gospel and mem- of Protestant churches 660,563 \"T\" aiuing eacn slave at an average of 400 dollars, or \u00c2\u00a3 80 here is a capital of \u00c2\u00a3 52,845,040 invested bj a Christian people in the bodies and souls of men. On the ground of this fearful statement, the Edinburgh Emancipation Society in its last annual report Would warn the Christians of Great Britain, in view of a mcetiug ot the Evangelical Alliance in 1851, to watch closely their stoppings, lest in their efforts to promote Christian union, they do injury to the cause of true Christienity, by joining hands with those who act in de- fiance of the whole spirit and tenor of the Gospel.\" And such an admonition is wisely given. Lamentable indeed, for the cause of the friendless slave who was the influence of the sixty American ministers who attended the Evangelical Alliance in 1846, and who contrived, (under the professed guidance of prayer with fasting,) to quash tfn resolutions for excluding slaveholders from the meetings, and thus to throw open the doors of their Christian Assembly to the traffickers in human beings\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd to the open defenders and perpetrators of the sum of allvillanies.\" Warned by this controversy, from which it is feared the Allianee will never recover, the British organization of that body, at a meeting held at To. quay, last November, passsd the resolution That regarding the present state of slavery in the United States, and more particularly the Fugitive Slave Bill, they cannot invite shareholders to their meeting in August, 1851.\" 0 Independently, however, of any effect upon the Evan- gelical Alliance, many a thoughtful mind contemplates with deep enxiety the unfavourable moral influence upon the snti-slavery sentiments of Great Britain, which is likely to be exerted by the presence of a large number of slaveholders, and pro-slavery ministers and laity, spread- ing themselves through the country on the occasion of the Great Exhibition. If it be considered necessary for the health and personal security of the visitors at the aproaching exhibition, that extensive sanatory measures and a large protective fores be called into operation, a spiritual police is not the less needed to prevent the spread of a moral pestilence through our land. And in few directions will its efforts be more desirable than in watching against the insidious misre- presentations of the pro-slavery ministers. Nor will those who openly defend slavery be our mo.st formidable invaders. There is another more dangerous dsss-ministers from the FREE States, professing hostility to slavery, but in reality sanctioning it under various pretexts. They arc, however, easily recognised by the experienced friend of the slave, for they betray certain unmistakeable characters. As no public meetings in reference to the American slavery have been called in the metropolis at the present momentous crisis in this question (giving s'rong evidence, if such were needed, that the anti-slavery feeling which once existed in England lies buried in torpor), it is greatly to hoped that the ministers throughout the country may exercise the needed watchfulness as to the American bre- thren,\" who may soon be expected to visit our shores, boldly inquiring of them what has been their course in relation to slavery, faithfully protecting their own pulpits from being desecrated by the unhallowed services of stave. holders and their defenders. This question of human rights this duty to the cause of the helpless slave\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdis of too seldom a character to be trifled with even the con- ventional laws of hospitality ought not to stand in the way of the \"higher law.\" No one pretends to deny that it is the religious bodies of America who maintain slavery, or that if they were faithful in their duty to God and man, this iniquity would at once terminate. The church holds the key of the slave dungeon, and she will not unlock the door and let the captive go free.\" Under circumstances so awful, it surely becomes the duty of England, as a Christian country- so exeit all the moral influence she possesses in pointing out to her brethren of the United States their unhappy position. We send missions to evangelise the heathen in savage lands; why should we pass by three millions of human beings in a Christian country, suffering all the ill of physical bondage, of mental thraldom, and of pagan darkness, who are sighing for liberty, instruction, and the gio-ious light of the Gospel ? The sentiment of the religious and intelli- gent mind of England cannot but have great weight with our fellow Christians across the Atlantic. It would be a labour of love and of mercy to them, as well as to the slave, to enlighten their understanding, and awaken their consciences. Could a more fitting work be performed than for each section of the religious world of Great Britain and Ireland to send a friendly remonstrance to those Churches of the United States, with which they sympathise in doctrine and discipline, upon their respon- sibilities, their duties, and their dangers in relation to slavery? Let it be remembered, that the existence is more to be deprecated in the United States, than in any other part of the vorld where it still prevails. For there it sins against greater liberty and greater light. The popu- lation of the States is now nearly twenty millions, and its increase is so rapid, that it is estimated that it will amount oftt Rowan Ofttholic^hijwctr, on sunday last, in this town: \"A.

THE ARCHSISHOP OF CANTERRURV AND THE RUBRIC.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd It is understood that the Archbishop of Canterbury proposes to bring the rubrical question to an issue in his diocease His Grace is said to have been in correspondence for some time past with seve- ral clergymen of his diocese, on the subject of alleged Romanizing practices; some of the Clergy at once yeldingto his Grace, wihle others vindicated their pro- ceedings as being conformable to the rubric. In one case, that of the Rev. C. S. Caflin, of Westerham, Kent, who pe sisted, after the Archbishop's private remon strance, in intoning the prayei-s, his Grace has issued a monition, enjoyningthe discontinuance of the practice with a view to further proceedings in the Ecclesiastical Court, in the event of non-compliance. An applica- tion to the Court of Queen's Bench is spoken of, to supersede the monition, in the supposition of its trench- ing upon the liberty of the Clergy to perform the ser vice according to their own discretion, within the terms of the rubric. LORD JOHN RUSSELT- AND HIS PROTOTYPE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA writer like Plutarch might run a pretty parallel be- tween the King who signed Magna Charta and the Minister who moved the Reform Bill in the House of Commons. Even the fortunes of their houses have a resemblance. William, the great ancestor of King John, appropiiated a considerable amount ofecclesias tical property; and Thomas, thr> great ancestor of Lord John, made a good thing out of the grants of Church lands that were going in this day. Both the King and the Lord were younger brothers, and consequently \"lacklands.\" The similarity of their achievements in constitution-making has been already alluded to.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd King John borrowed byzants from Isaac of York, to put himself in a condition to seize the reigns of go- vernment, and worried the Jew with mock honours at the tournament of Ashby. Lord John sirenghtened himself to contest the City of London by an alliance with Baron Rothschild, and then tantalized his ally with postponements of Jewish emancipation. King John, if we believe William Shakspere, mouthed it valiantly when he quarelled with the Pope; but after- wards consented to hold his crown in fee of the spiritu- al sovereign. Whether the parallel is to hold good here to, it remains for the future to show: but when the big words of the Durham Letter are compared with the small doings of the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, and when it is considered that a promise has been given to make that small measure smaller still, it does appear as if the Lord were equally ready with the King to eat humble pie at the bidding of the Pope in whose teeth he flung a brave defiance.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdSpectator. EXTRAORDINARY FEAT AT ROTHERHAM. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd On Tuesday a man named Thomas Corbett, of Rotherham, accomplished the following feat:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdFor a wager of JL'5. a side, he agreed to trundle a wheel three feet in di- ameter, and weighing two cwt. to Doncasterand back, 24 miles, in 11 hours. His hands were not to be pro- tected by gloves. On Tuesday morning at seven o'clock, he started from the post-office. High-street, Ro herham. A vast crowd of people assembled to wit- ness the start. He arrived at Doncaster at ten minu- tes past ten, having rccomplished the 12 miles in rather more that three hours. He arrived in Rotherham, on his return, at twenty minutes to five, having won the match, with an hour and twenty minutes to spare. His eutry into Rotherham was witnessed by several hund- red spectators. A NEW SUBJECT FOR PRACTICE IN DISSECTING,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd John Henry Whitaker, a young man in the service of a surgeon in the neighbourhood of Finsbury-square, was brought before the Lord Mayor at the Mansion House, on Tuesday, upon the charge of having stolen a chronometer, the property, of Mr. Webster, clock manufacturer, of Cornhill.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt appeared that on the previous Friday evening, the prisoner had been with Mr. Shaw, the porsecutor's house keeper, who lived over the shop, and had known the prisoner for three years, when they went down to the shop to see a con- struction intended for the Great Exhibition. Next morning Mr Shaw missed a chonometer which had been in the shop, and in the evening the prisoner called with some jewellery in a pill-box to have it valued, when he was told to bring it again on Monday, which he did, and Mr. Shaw having shown it to the prosecu- tor's foreman, he found that the jewels formed por- tions of the missing chronometer. J The same day in- formation having been given to the police, an officer proceeded to the house of the prisoner's employer, when the prisoner, who was in the surgery with ano- ther young man, on being questioned as to the box of jewels, said he found it in Old-street road. On his room upstairs having been searched, articles were found which afterwards proved to be portions of the chronometer, as well as the chronometer-box. It also appeared that the prisoner had disposed of the silver chronometer-case at Mr. Sirrell's, in the Barbican, on Satuarday morning,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe prisoner was remanded. THE CORN TRAU<< IN FRANCE\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Banker's Ma- gazine for March, in its review of the corn trade for the past month, gives the following information in con- nexion with the recent abundance in France, by which our markets have been so strongly influenced The corn trade continues dull, and the arrivals from France miantain themselves on a large scale. We alluded last month to the last two or three years in France, and the consequent extreme cheapness of corn in that country. We have since collected further evidence tending to confirm our statements. We have before us at this moment an official paper in the Moniteur, in the form of a report, dated the 8th of Febuary, 1851, from General Randon, the French Minister of War, to the President of the Republic, relative to the rees- tablishment of a system discontinued some years ago for the purchase by the State of all the corn consumed by the army. The object of the report is to point out that:in consequence of the present most unusual cheap- ness of corn in France a large supply can be bought on decidedly advantageous terms; and that, to some extent at least, the absorption of so considerable a quantity of corn from overs'ocked market will be a measure of lelief to the agricultural interests of France who complain loudly of the depreciation of their pro- duce. The President of the Republic has confirmed the Recommendations of the report, and ordered that they shall take effect on the 1st of April, 1850. SHOCKING TTAGEDY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA few days ago, M. D- went to a farmer, living at St. Claude, near Blois, and demanded payment of a consideruble sum of money, which had long been due to him. The farmer sent away his wife, and invited his creditor into an inner chamber to write a receipt. As he entered the far- mer discharged a gun at him, wounded him severely, after which he cut his throat. He then placed the body in a cart, conveyed it to about a mile and a half from the village, and buried it in a field. His wife became aware of the murder, and reproached him in bitter terms. Fearing that she would inform the po- lice of his crime, he left his home and came to Paris. A description of his person was sent up, and his dead Dody was discovered at the Morgue he had commit- ted suicide by throwing himself into the Seine. WHOLESALE MupDFRs IN FRANCE. A farmer named Rouchoux, living with his family in an isolated house at St. Etienne-Vallee-Grancaise (Lozsre), re- cently agreed to puiohase some land for 3,000f, Pro- curing the necessaay sum a few days beforehand, he kept it in his house until the legal formalities should be acomplished. A few days ago his children, contra- ry to their constant custom, did not go to school, and the schoolmaster sent to inquire respecting them. The messenger found the house fastened up, and no reply was given to his knocking at the door. He accordin\"- ly, with the assistance of some neighbours, broke open the door, A horrible spectacle presented itself\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdas lying on the ground, in a pool of blood, were Rouchoux his wife and two sons, quite dead, whilst another son, a boy, aged seven, was severly cut about the head and face. The murders had heen perpetrated with an axe. Upstairs the mother of Rouchoux, who was very old, was also found murdered\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdher skull had been beaten in with a stone. The drawer in which the money had been placed was broken open, and the 3,000f., with the exception of one piece of 5f., had been taken away. SUSpIcIOn fell on Baptiste, the brother-in-law of Rou- clwux. and a wooden j'foa stained with blood was found in his house. His replies to questions put to him were so contradtctory that he was arrested. It is hoped that the life of the little boy will be saved. A WHOLE smp's CREW POISONED.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLast week the Isabellq, of Jersey, arrived there with the Captain dead and all the crew suffering. It appeared at the inquest held on the body of the Captain, that they had partaken of pea soup, and were immediately after- wards attacked vittlx pains in the bowels and vomit- ing. The cook vya. suspected, and had been taken into custody, and the inquest was adjourned for a post mortem examination of the body. The Sheffield Independent states that a youth in that town, eighteen years of age has just finished a staghaf- ted sportman's knife, which contains three blades, a pair of scissors, two saws, a lancet, a nail-file, a cigar holder, a button-hook, a horse hook, a corkscrew, a gun screw, pricker and tweezers, and brace borer! SUPERSTITION IN 1851.-A farmer in Cheshire, with- in a few miles of Rock Kerry, having apprised his brother, who resides in Wales, that he had recently lost several cows by distemper, he received the tollow- ing letter in reply :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdDear Brother, I am sorry to tell you that some ill-disposed person has been wish- ing you all your losses that you have had.

It is reported that the French government has ad- dressed a note to the cabinet of London repirini^tlv expulsion of Ledra Rollin and other French lefusrees. whose present facilities of communication with Paris nnd the departments are found exceedingly embaras sing to the French government, and calculated to add dangerous complications to the present crisis.

A ministerial decree opens a credit of 70,000 francs on the Budget of 18.H, for the restora- tion of the Cathedral of Rbeirns. A commission of persons officially connected with prisons and \u00c2\u00a1he police has been charged to visit Belgium, to in- quire into the sanitary regulations of the prisons of that country. An iliegalpowder manufac!o,y has- been discovered at Montplaisir, near Lyons. The whole of the implements have been seized by the authorities, and several persons arrested. The fnneral obsequies of General Lefrancois, commanding one of the brigades of the infantry of Paris, took place on Tuesday with the usual military honours. The cortege was composed of all the principal military authorities of the capital. The General was also se- verely wounded in the June insurrection, and in almost every account published of that sanguinary affair he was put down as dead. SPAIN. Accounts from Madrid of the 17th inst. state that the religious ceremonies of the Holy Week were cele- brated with the usual pomp in all the churches of Madrid. The Queen washed the feet of six poor men in the Royal chapel, and at four o'clock her Majesty, accompanied by the King and the entIre. Court, left the palace to perform the seven stations. The Ifaraldo states that the Progresistas intended to avail themselves of the general elections to raise again their banners. General Espartero has not only accepted the post of honour to which the electors of that party had elevated him, but was disposed likewise to occupy de facto the presidency of the electoral directing com- mittee. General Ortega, one of his friends, was also very active. The Government on being informed that he had left on the 16th for Arragon, immediately sent an express after him with orders to arrest him wherever he was to be met. PRUSSIA. Berlin correspondence of the 21st inst., mentions that the Ministerial papers state that Austria has proposed, in case of certain events, to march 200,000 troops through Piedmont. This proposal, which has been submitted to the cabinet of I min. has made a deep impression at Berlin. The same papers mention a secret treaty between Russia and Austria, and that they endeavour to gain the support of Prussia. The object of the secret Austro-Rassian treaty is to pro- tect Europe against the results of the crisis which is impending in France. The Ministerial papers contain an official contradiction of the rumours which are lately circulated respecting Cheva\\ier Bunsen, the Prussian Ambassador at the Court of St. James s, and protest that the Chevalier has not, as has been asserted, been insulted by certain German refugees. Berlin correspondence of the 22nd inst. likewise states that on Baron Malltcuffell's return to Berhn. on the 21st ult\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd a Cabinet Council was held, 'be particulars of which have not yet transpired. The Kreus Zeitung states that the last Austrian note ex- presses the intention of the Cabinet of Vienna rather to drop the annexation question than consent to the conditions under which Prussia ofrers her consent. AUSTRIA. Vienna correspondence of the 20th inst., announces 'the appointment of Prince Schwartzeuburgh to the Governorship of Transylvania, vice General Wolge- muth, deceased. ITALY. The Opinione of Turin of the 16th ult., confirms the intelligence of France and England having both protested against the prolonged occupation of Tus cany by the Austrian troops. The same paper says that it is in contemplation to form a league between Naples, Rome, Tuscany, Parma, and Modena, for 'he mutual preservation of tranquillity in both states. The Constitution ale of Florence, of the 13th ultimo, states that the political writings of Marquis Massino d'AzegliQ; the actual President of the'Piedmontese Council of Minister have pst been prohibited in Tuscany. A jetfpr f'om Mantua, of the 16th ultimo, | states that the Municipality and their President,, Count Cavriani, have resigned their functions. The 12th of April being the anniversary of the re- turn of the Pope to Rome the members of the Diplo- matic body waited on his 'Holiness with their com- pliments. The Senator of Rome, the Ministers, and other personages of distinction followed that example. At one o'clock General Gemeau, Commander-in- j Chief of the French forces reviewed, on 'lie square of Saint Peter, the troops of the garrison.

IMPORTANT FROM PORTUGAL. j The following is the intelligence which has reached lls by the Peninsula and Oriental Company's steam- ship. Madrid:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe insurrection in Portugal still lingers on. Although the king is at the head of 4^00 men, he has not advanced against Saldanha, hut continues at Santarem aud on the 1 ith or 18th. Bento, a partisan of Saldanha's passed the Tagus at the head of about 600 men, with much baggage, and proceeded to join Saldanha's forces atCoimbra. It is generally admitted that Saldanha made a great mistake in not occupying Santarem and had he done so, the Queen would have been compelled to dismiss Cabral from his post, and all would have gone well. Her obstinacy, however, in spite of the menacing; state of affairs, and the advice of Sir H. Seymour and the French Minister, will ruin all, and seriously en- danger her own safety\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdindeed, nothing short of aj Regency is now talked of, and last week she received a letter from the royal army, stating th*t a regiment, of which the Prince Royal is the colonel, was waver- i ing, an?l that the only thing which cojild establish its loyalty was the appearance of their yftung colonel at their head. The Queen showed this Jetter to a copfi- dencial nobleman in her household, who urged her so strongly to retain thp young priafrff^jfop^t her person, that her suspicions were eF. \"and at length she elicited from her adviser, t..\u00c2\u00bb tnernoment her son appeared at the head of his regiment, her own abdication was inevitable-that he wpuld b\u00c2\u00ab immedi- ately proclaimed king, and that Sabjainah vfould be at the head of the Regency. Tjjjts jFWfrg Prince enter- tains no friendly feeling towards Cabral. Saldanah, with the troops that have |$fhed &i\u00c2\u00abi, proceeded northward, and leaving them at Coimbra, he^ytfelf proceeded towards Oporto, and receivini\u00c3\u00a0n unsatis- factory reply to his summons to Oporto, took the directioiwof Viseu, where he was. according to the latest accounts. \\V\\en- Bento joins him, he will \u00e2\ufffd\u00a0^tpuster about 2,000 llrong, but he has the hearts of n the soldi$EPf~ \u00c2\u00a3 ad but a little would send them all ? over t4ti!?ir favourite marshal. The first step of the Queen was tfsend the Mindelho to Oporto, offer- ing the Count Casal, the governor of that place. the lieutenant-generalship of the northern provinces, and ending him an order of Knighthood. In consequence he sent a decisive and loyal reply to Saldanah, and Oporto remains tranquil, although the troops do not hesitate openly to avow their predilection for Salda- nah. Oporto, too, although sver npe for disaffection has had her teeth drawn too effectually to enable he \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2) hold tile same important position as heretofore, \u00c2\u00abs tie guns having been removed since the insurrectio: The policy of Sahhnah has been to hold himsei' I iloof from the Junta party and in that he has dom viselv. Singularly enough, there are none of the Jounr las Antas party now to be found, and thev 'o vill, of course, endeavour to keep these unhappv euds smouldering until they can suit their own pur- joses. At present the majority of the population tre busy in agricultural pursuits, and the capital itself s perfectly quiet.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdSaldanah, according to the last iccounts from Lisbon, was in it most critical position n the neighbourhood of Viseu. Colonel Joaquim iiento. at the hexd oftheoth Cassadores, had not \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2iucceeded in effecting a junction with the Duke ilthough he had managed to cross the rivers Tagus md Z'zere. He was subsequently flanked by the first brigade of the king's forces, and compelled to recross the latter river. Count de Casal, the governor )f Oporto, had refused to pronounce in favour of the insurrectionary movement of Marshal Saldanah. An express had reached Lisbon from Madrid, with assu- rances of support from Spain in the shape of a force on the frontiei. and two Spanish steam-frigates had been ordered to proceed to the Tagus. The follow- ing telegraphic despatch, announcing the failure of the insurrectionary movement in Poitugal, was re- ceived at the Portuguese Legation.

Letters from New York i-eport,witli respect to the domestic affairs of the United States, that political matters remain quiet. No further distur- banccs had occurred at Boston touching the fugitive slave arrested there on the eve of Franklin's de- parture. Larixe meetings of the populace were being held, and the Rev. Theodore Parker and other speakers urged violent resistance to the laws, but the prisoners were safely guarded by the military, &c., and no rising occurred on the 7th. Judge Shaw refused a writ of habeas corpus applied for on the petition of Thomas Simms, the fugitive slave. Fugitive slaves were discovered by the commissioners living upon the flesh of their dead companions. From Texas we learn that the Hungarian colonists had met a most favourable reception. Our mercantile letters from New York states that owing to the influx of gold from California, &c.. the threatened decline in sterling exchange had not been realised. Our letters from San Francisco extend to the 5th oi March, feeing 16 days later than our last accounts. Great excitement has been caused by the threatened lynching in San Francisco of two men suspected of almost murdering a merchant named Jansen, in his store, and robbing him of 2,OOQ dollars. Ultimately the jury disagreed, and the people, after tremendous excitement, quietly dispersed. Political affairs were also in an excited condition arising from the struggle to elect a senator to the United States. From the mines we learn that drv weather continued to be ex- perienced, and from the lack of pin apprehensions were entertained in many new quarters locations had, however, been explored which promised to yield largely, and from the general tenor of the accounts it was expected that unusually large receipts of dust would be received during the spring, the miners having adopted plans to meet the difficulty. Gold dust was already arriving somewhat more freely at SanFrancisco, and the assayers were fully employed. Quartz roek mining and crushing by machinery was being prosecuted with great activity. On the 2nd of March two steamers were destroyed by fire at San Francisco. i Our accounts state, in regard to rrercantile affairs, that since the departure of the previous mail business operations had been light. Goods had been offeredfVeelv t or sale at auction, and lower prices ac<^?C^Sj. Letters town the Gulf of Mexico received in New York announced, in relation to the Tehaun- tepee Railroad Company's operations on the Isthmus, that the engineers had discovered two deep, well sheltered, and spacious barbours on the Pacific shores, a few miles south-east of the town. of Tehauntepec. From Chagres we have accounts to the 29th, and from Panama to the 26th ult. On the 25th a destructive fire took place on the island of lobago, at Panama, lrom which the store- houses and property of the Pacific Mail Steam Ship Company were barely saved. Some ao houses were destroyed. On the 28th the men who mur- j dered eight persons on the Chagres river were to be shot. Letters from Havannah of the 3rd ult. received at New York state that political affairs had been quiet, although vague rumours of a revolutionary attempt had prevailed at New I Orleans. Other letters state that on the 26th ult. a serious fire occurred at San Diegos de Los Banosi; six houses were consumed. Henrv Clay still remained in the citv. Valparaiso accounts of February 25th state tha't the Copiapo railroad was making satisfactory progress. From Oregon we have accounts to February 22, but they are unim- portant. From the Sandwich Islands, under date January 28th, we learn that a terrific gale bad been experienced several vessels were much I damaged. The difficulties with the French were expected to be amicably settled. Business was dull Letters from Hongkong had been received only 17 days after their departure from China. Letters from Peru state that the result of the Pre- sidential election had excited no disturbances. Troops had been despatched to quell a rising of slaves in Truxillo. Letters from Canada state that Mr. Thompson was still lecturing there on slavery. Some si^ns of resumption in the annex- ation movement are rioted.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. THE FRENCH REPUBLIC. The National Assemblv meet in the middle of next month, and the rumours as to the policy of the Prince President are beginning to assume a tangible shape. It is no longer attempted to be disguised that Louis Napoleon will make a determined effort to prolong the term of his Presidency-legally and constitution- ally if he can, btft by force of arms if peaceful measures fail, and, judging by probabilities, the fu- ture of France opens forth a dismal picture. The first step towards the accomplishment of the I rest- dent's designs will be a message to the Assembly, calling upon the representatives of the people to pro- ceed to an immediate revision of ine constitution. To do this, the Assembly must first of all, suspend the. constitution. That extraordinary production of states- manship was so fenced round at the time of its adop- tion, and so jealous were its authors of any change, that it provides a series of checks to any important alteration, and the period for any legal revision would extend over the term of Louis Napoleon s continu- L1.L .1_- ance in office. It is to meet this ditnculty tnat the message to the Assembly will be sent. What the President means by a revision of the constitution is a striking out of those portions which render him in eligible for re-election, and limits his term of office to March, 1851 and in this appeal to the Assembly Louis Napoleon will encounter his first great difficulty. He may be popular with the army, and on as good terms with the people as he undoubtedly is with him- self, but he has positively no party not a shadow of power\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin the Assembly. This vvas incontestibly proved on the appointment of a permanent committee which sits in Paris to watch over the government during the recess. Not a single Bonapartist was appointed on the committee, and its leading members are men known to be personally disliked by, and op- posed to, the President. To expect then that the Assembly would yiolate their two-years-old consti- tution for the sole purpose of promoting the personal and ambitious views of the President would be ab. surd. Foiled in the Assembly, it is said, Louis Na- poleon threatens to appeal to the people. This term has little meaning in England, but it has a portentous signification in France. An appeal to the people here means a general eletion hustings^ speeches, wine-bibbing, bribery, and all the concomitants of a county or borough contest-but in r ranee it means a building up of the barricades, an appeal to the worst passions of the people, a setting of the poor against the rich, and an attempt to enlist the sharp swords of the appallant. A crisis is fast approaching in France-another sanguinary struggle looms in the distance. The introducing of the provisions of the new law of the press, has given rise to a variety of 'difficulties and to several prosecutions. No less than nine journals, the Siecle, the Rational, the Cor- saire, the Atsemblee Nationale, the Gazette de Lranee, the Journalpoure rire, the Peuple, the Monitmr du Soir, and the Evenernent, are under prosecution for contraventions, some of them harmless :nd uninten- tional, of the law relative to the signature of articles. A preliminary objection as to the competency of the Court of Correctional Police was overruled by the tribunal on Wednesday, and the trials fixed for Fri- day. The director of the journal Le Peuple, and one of the editors, were sentenced on Monday by the Assize Court of Paris to three years' imprisonment each and 6,000f. fine, the one for signing, and the other for publishing, an article exciting the citizens to hatred and contempt of each other, outi aging pub- lic morals and religion, and exciting to civil war. A confidential agent of Henry V. is in Paris, in active communication with the leading members of the Legitimist party, who are instructed to oppose any prolongation of the powers of the President. The fusion\" between the two branches of the Bovrbon fonihr -v i. -fly nsserted by him to be very near a mis; tory conci'jiion. t The conductors of the TJnivers aave address! a letter to the Archbishop, expressing their deep regret at having incurred his censuie, and promising to ob- serve in future more moderation in discussions on religious subjects. The Archbishop, in reply, accepts their submission, and promises to communicate to the Pope their laudable determination. The whole of the fleet at Cherbourg has sailed for Brest. Madame de Vaines, a niece of M. Guizot, has been severely burnt at the chateau of Villelouet, in conse quence of her dress taking fire, and has since died 11 from the injuries received. ITALY. The financial condition of the Pontifical States ap- pears to be most unsatisfactory. The cost to the Roman Government of the Austrian and French ar- mies of occupation, amounts to 90,000 dollars per month, or about \u00c2\u00a3 215,000 sterling per annum. Ad- ding to this the expenses of the Roman army, the total exceeds two millions per annum, or one-third of the present revenue. The mint is at work night and day. The copper money is put into circulation, but the gold and silver are kept back to form a caisse de reserve, at the disposal of his Holiness. The Cardi- nals have very limited establishments, always in marching order,\" from an apprehension of populai outbreak. The native soldiery is not to be depended on. Recently a detachment passing through Sim- gaglia, and being saluted by the population with cries of '\u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 Nivan i soldati <?' Italia\" Tivano gh Itaham morti ai preti,\" the soldiers joined in the cries. Tbe officers marched them to Bologna, to be tried by Court-martial, and decimated by the Austrians. BELGIUM. The latest accounts of the health of the Queen of the Belgians are, we regret to say, unfavorable. Every hope of moving her Majesty, whose complaint is a general pthisis, to Brussels, is for the present abandoned. She grows weaker and weaker, although at times she rallies and appears to suffer less pain. Her Royal mother and other members of her family are in constant attendance upon her. She has made her will, and received the last sacraments of her Church. The King is deeply distressed. The last bulletin, of the 8th inst., states that her Majesty had passed a quiet night, and enjoyed a few hours' repose, in consequence of which there was a slight ameliora- tion in her state. GERMANY. The College of Princely Plenipotentiaries have formally approved the despatches addressed to the Vienna Cabinet, and to the Prussian Charge d' Affaires at Cassel. The conflict between the Government and the people in Electoral Hesse continues to be carried on with equal tenacity on both sides. General Haynau has issued a decree for the dissolution of the Civic Guards. Against this measure the Mayor formally protested, and the Guards thcm- selves refused to give up their arms aud accoutre- ments. On the other hand, the permanent Com- mittee have presented to the Judge Advocate's Court a formal accusation against General Haynau, for violation of the Constitution, and treason to the country, which has been referred to the gar- rison Court-martial. In this state of affairs, the members of the Supreme Court of Appeal, accom- panied by the Attorney-General, have proceeded to Wilhelmsbad for the purpose of urging the Elector to repeal such of his ordinances as com- mand the adoption of compulsory measures. The officers of the garrison also have waited upon General Haynau, entreating him to suspend for- cible measures, until one of their body Lieutenant- Colonel Hildebrand, should have bad time to return from Wilhelmsbad, whither he had gone to i consult with the Miuister of War, and probably with the Elector. Meanwhile, on the night of the 5th, General Haynau sent roimd patrols to close the presses and seize two or three jour a s. The editor of one of these, Dr. Oelker, having resisted, was arrested, and carried off to prison. An attempt was also ?made to arrest an. ox-Deputy, named Henckel, who, however, took refuge in the room of the Permanent Committee, when the President warned the officer employed of the inviolability of Members during forty-two days afterthe dissolution of the Chamber. The officer accordingly withdrew, and Dr. Oelker, who is also. a Member, was like. wise released. Prince Friodriek of Hesse, left Hanau on the 5th inst. for B-erlin. PRUSSLA. The Constittitionclle Zcitunq having violently as- sailed M. de^tfrtowitz, has been depiived of the pri- vilege of cfeyance by the Post-office. Baron de Meyendorf, the Prussian Ambassador, has been recalled, and has left Berlin for Vienna. Prior to his departure, he had two long and confiden- tial interviews with the Kinp, who, on taking his leave, presented him with the insignia of the Black Eagle', an honour conferred but on one foreign diplo i matist since 1815. A note is said to have been addressed to tha Austrian and Prussian Governments by the Russian Cabinet upon the affairs of Hesse avi<i other matters counected with the present state of Germany. A regular office has been established at Berlin, for engaging recruits for the insurrectionary army. with the full cognizance of the police and the government. Considering the treaty recently concluded with Den- mark, this can be viewed in no other light than as a gross breach of good faith. A shocking tragedy was enacted on the 6th inst., at Kruziewis, in the Duchy of l'osen. It appears that at the commencement of the Russian campaign in Hungary, twelve Circassian noblemen engaged as volunteers in the Russian Circassian Regiment, and returned to Warsaw decorated for good conduct. The campaign having terminated, they wished to return home but they were detained, and placed in the same category as the common, Circassian soldiers. All their remonstrances being unheeded, they quitted Warsaw, and two of their number having been killed by their pursuers, the remaining ten escaped across the Prussian frontier. On reaching Kruziewis, they expressed a wish to be conducted to Berlin and there disarmed, but the authorities refused and made pre- parations to have them reconducted to Poland. Driven to despair they determined to sell their lives as dear as possible, and placed themselves on the de- fensive again;?' the Dragoons sent to capture them. Several lives were lost in the sanguinary conflict which ensued, before they could be overpowered. DENMARK. The success ofthe Schleswig-Holstcincrsin their attack upon Friederichstadt has been by no means as splended as their own boastful accounts had represented. It turns out that instead of fourteen pieces of artillery only three smalls guns fell into their hands. Even the partial success, however, which thev obtained in the first instance, has been turned into defeat After six days con- tinued bombardment General Willisen determined upon an assault on the morning of the 5th. The troops advanced in three columns, by the Eider- dyke, the high-road, and the Trccncn-dyke. The Danes opened a severe fire along their whole line of defences against the advancing columns, which were thrown back with tremendous loss. \"A retreat was sounded,\" say the German accounts, on perceiving new lines of defence not previously known of.\" The fighting continued till near mid- night. Sixteen officers out of twenty belonging to one of the battalions engaged in the assault were slain. It was expected that the Holsteiners would withdraw from before the place. Half the town is destroyed. General Willisen has made a report to the' Statthalterschaft, in which, after confessing his repulse, and praising the enemy's bravery, ^he says that the result will have no decisive effect on the operations of the war, and estimates his loss at from 200 to 300 men killed and wounded. Other accounts, however, state the total of his loss at not less than 600 or 700 men. The Commandant of Friederichstadt is, it appears, Colonel Helgensen, and not Colonel Latour du Ain, who is at present in Copenhagen. The Holstein Ministry has in the Chamber given an explanation of the three Friends of Peace, which holds out an exceedingly faint hope of any result proceeding from it. 1\\vo Englishmen,\" the Chief of the Department of Foreign Affairs said, Messrs. Sturge and Wheeler, and an American, Elihu Burritt, had come withont any direct authority from the Frankfort Congress to Schleswig-IIolstein, impelled by the wish to secure a peaceful settlement of the conflict. He had first made the acquaintance of these gentlemen ir. Rendsburg; two of them belonged to the sect of Quakers. They seemed to him simple, sincere mer.; who must have gained attention if mere- ly by the interest they displayed in the Holstein cause. But the difficulties that lay in their way were very gr(T.t, inasmuch as neither of them spoke either the German or Danish languages, and all were igno- rret of tie legal questions at issue.\" UNITED STATES. Two more Rills of importance, the last of the neasures jompt ehended in Mr. Clay's Omnibus nr.vepii.S3 uowi H'onjov. a<l received the signature of the President, vix., a Bill for the restoration of Fugitive Slaves, and ?. Bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in the district of Columbia. Two attempts in tbejSenate to procure the abolition of slavery in the distrrt of Columbia have been defeated by large majorities. Notwithstanding the peaceable character of the proceedings in Congress, the pacification of the Union seems far from being accomplished. The Governor of Georgia has called a State convention-the dele- gates to be elected November 25th, and the conven- tion to meet December 10th. The South Corolina papers exhort Georgia to take the lead, promising that South Carolina will foltow her example.\" Governor Quitman has convened the Legislature of Mississippi for the 20th of October, in pursuance of the power given him by the Legis- lature, in the event of Congress legislating on slavery in the district of Columbia, a district less than ten miles square, ceded to the general Government as a place for the political metropolis, by the States of Maryland and Virginia, which has no Governor or State Legislature Congress being its domestic Le- gislature and Government, except in matters con- signable by the Mayor and Councils of Washington city. Under these circumstances it is contended by the North, that Congress, as the Legislature of the district of Columbia, has the power in the district, which the States Legislatures have in the several States, to regulate and even abolish slavery. This is denied by the South, as not provided for in the deed of cession from Maryland and Virginia, their real objection being, that such legislation might be drawn into a precedent, to establish a right in Con- gress to interfere with slavery. South Carolina which is the hotbed of disunion, will of course call a convention. Thus three States are about to be agitated, in opposition to the Union. The beneficent effects of increasing communica- tion with Africa, and of colonizing it with free negroes from the United States, are very palpable. Free negroes in this country are, and undoubtedly always will be, in a position of decided inferiority. They can never gain that equality of rank, and of social and political condition, essential to the development of their faculties, and to the attainment of that de- gree of happiness and social prosperity, for which they may be fitted. Experience, moreover has shown that in Liberia they can plant colonies which will take an honourable rank among communities in all the re3pects which mark progress in civilization and in morality. An independent government has already been established there, which is doing remarkably well, and it needs only the aid of increased immigra- tion to carry it forward with rapidity and substan- tial strength. The friends of this project insist that from eight to twelve thousand free negroes may be exported every year by three ships, and that after two years they will be able to sustain themselves, and that the colony will readily absorb and employ any ^number that may be taken thither. This establish- ment on the coast of Africa will doubtless greatly augment the commerce of this countiy. In palm oil, for which there is a constantly increasing demand, in gold, which is found at various points of the coast, in ivory, coffee, cam, and other dye-woods, gums of various kinds, and in many fruits peculiar to tropical regions, there will undoubtedly be an extensive and z:' increasing traffic. The Naval Committee in the House of Representatives has made a report highly favourable to the project, and it has enlisted very ardent advocacy in and out of Congress. The govern- ment is to advance two-thirds of the cost of building those vessels, which is not to exceed 900,000 dollars each, the amount to be repaid within 3D years and is to pay 40,000 dollars for each trip, or 480,000 dollars per annum, and the contract is to last 15 years. A conflict of a most sanguinary character has taken place at Sacramento City between the squatters and the proprietors who bought land from Captain Sutter under the new Helvetia grant from Mexico. The settlers contend that the grant in question did not cover this territory, that it rightfully belongs to the United States Govern- ment. A suit having been instituted, the Court decided in favour of the claimants under Sutter when on proceeding to execute writs of ejectment a sanguinary riot commenced, in which the Mayor and several other officers, as well as Dr. Robinson and a man named Mahloney, two leaders of the squatters, were shot dead. This happened on the 14th of August, and on the 15th, according to the latest inteligence, Sacramento City was reduced to ashes, and the squatters were receiving rein- forcements of men from the mines. <:> 01", "word": "2", "description": "\u2026 contract is to last 15 years.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. THE FRENCH REPUBLIC. The elpction for Paris has resulted in the triumph of the Socialist and Red-republican; party. M. Eugene Sue has been returned by a majority of about 12,000 votes over the Conservative candidate, Mr. Leclerc. The result of the election caused considerable anxiety at the Elysee. Count Mole, and SDveral of the leaders of the Moderate party, had interviews with the President. At a Council of Ministers, sub- sequently held, it was determined to bring forward a measure for the modification of the law of universal suffrage. On Monday, fifteen of the Moderate representatives, foreseeing the success of M. Eugene Sue, expressed a wish to present a Bill beforehand, having for its object the regulation of the exercise of universal suffrage but they were prevented by the Minister of the Interior, who stated that, in case of necessity, he was ready to bring forward a project of law. It is understood there is to be no change in the Ministry. It is stated as a fact characteristic of the President, that notwithstanding the agitation of the capital throughout the day, Prince Louis Napoleon was to be seen walking qietly in some of the most populous streets of Paris, in a plain habit bourgeois, and followed by a single foottnan. The Napoleon newspaper has been suppressed. The fact was announced on Tuesday, by the President himself, to the conductors of that paper. SPAIN. There has been a great commotion in the Court of Madrid, occasioned by the King Consort having lent himself to some intrig-e against Narvaez, !or which the Minister removed him from his office of Governor of the Palace. The King having threatened to desert Her Majesty, he was arrested by order of Narveaz, and detained in custody. From the following acredited version of the affair, it would seem that Narvaez has jeopardised his administration by what he has done The King-Consort had resolved to carry his plan into execution, and the doubling of the guards and other precautions were taken to prevent the King's going out of the Palace,the necessity of which measure the ministry had insisted on to the young Queen. In the Council assembled at the Palace, one of the Ministers stated to the King-Consort, in the presence of Queen Isabella, the deep displeasure felt by the Cabinet at the political dissidences which existed between them and him, and that it was high I time, for the carrying on of the Queen's Government, that such dissidences should be put an end to. The Minister then explained the matter upon constitutional principles, hinting at the anomaly of responsible Ministers being influenced, or having their acts modified, by an irresponsible Prince, and concluding that they had acted, and would continue to act, according to what they consideied their duty. The King-Consort, who had little or nothing to say on the subject, placed as it was under, to him, a new point of view, replied with common-places. He was glad to hear these explanations, he said, and take them into consideration. Scarcely had the Council broken up, when the King hastened to quit the Palace, and found to his great indignation., that he was virtually arrested. Hurrying to the Queen's apartments, he broke out into the bitterest invectives. He would no longer live in the Palace while this ^Ijnistry remained in power. The young people, as they usually do after a violent scene, seul for their mother, Queen,! Christina, who, ever full of sagacity, understood very clearly that the question could only be efficaciously resolved bv a change of Ministry, and at once pro- posed it. This was quite enough to effect au ima;e- diate reconciliation, and in order not to give motives for the public to surmise that the Royal couple were not on good terms, they drove to the Prado in an open carriage, accompanied bv Christina They weie sitting together in the Queen's apartments in the evening, when Naruaez was announced. The young Queen rose, and advancing to the door of her apart- ment said \"Retiraos\" (go away). These words, pronounced with considerable harshness, were suf- ficient to convince Narvaez that his fall was inevitable. ITALY. ROME.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt is stated that an encyclic letter addressed by the Pope to the Bishops is in the press, as also the concession of a Couucil of State, a new system of municipalities, and a pastoral letter to all the Generals of the religious orders. SICILY \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA shock of earthquake took place on the 14th ult., at Ragusa, which exceeded in violence and duration that of 1843, and threw the inhabitants into a perfect state of consternation. The undulatory movement first began at one o'clock in the day, and preceded by a bright light, which soon disappeared. The gates of the city were opened in ordir to give egress to the inhabitants in case of need. Many of the walls and roofs of the houses were damaged, and the furniture in some of them thrown down and broken. Similar shocks were felt at the same time at Jara and at Stagno at the latter place several houses were thrown down. GERMANY. HESSE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe trial of the men accused of assas- sinating Prince Lickhnowski and General Auerswald, in one of the insurrectionary movements of Frankfort, was brought to a close on the 27th before the Criminal Court of Haynau, in Electoral Hesse. The Jury declared the accused, Georg, Ludwig. Pflug, and Koeber guilty of having, by means of fire-arms, inflicted wounds which caused the death of the victims but it declared that, at the moment of the crime the accused were not in full possession of their mental faculties, owing to the political effervescence which prevailed.\" Georg was condemned to 20 years' hard labour of the first degree in irons in the hulks Ludwig to hard labour of the first degree in irons for life in the hulks Pflug to five years and a half labour in irons in the hulks Koeber to six months' detention in a house of correction. Another accused, named Deitrich, convicted of having dis- turbed the peace, was condemned to a years' impri- sonment, and two other accused, named Gambel and Schmidt, were acquitted. On hearing the sentences, the Jury resolved to recommend the accused to the clemency of the Sovereign. GREECE. Letters from Athens of the 16th ult. make no mention of the alleged arrangement between Baron Gros and Mr. Wyse, the pretended intelligence of which has lately been forwarded via Trieste and Vienna. After a series of conferences, which Con- tinued for eight days, and the last of which was held on the 15th, the representative of Great Britain and the French mediator were as far from anything like an understanding as they could possibly be. Baron Gros thought it irreconcileable with his convictions and with his instructions, with the dignity of Fiance and the independence of Greece, to make and to submit proposals of any kind to the Hellenic Govern- ment. The negociations were discontinued for two days (from the 13th to tl,e 15th inst.), when Mr. Wvse invited the French Ambassador to meet him on board the vessell L Inflexible. The result of their conference left the matter still unsettled. The, e Athens Courier blames the Greek Government, which it says, is encouraged in its resistence by the insinuations of foreigners, contrary to the wishes of the nation. TURKEY. Letters from Constantinople of the 15th ult. state that the Russian troops had begun to march out of the Danubian Principalities ami the whole, it was expected, would have been withdrawn ily t! 1:1., with the exception of the 10,00() men authorised to remain by virtue of the treaty. Letters from Smyrna state that shocks of an earth- quake have become so frequent there, that the ground is in a state of continual oscillation, and that many houses have already been damaged. Princess Bel\u00c2\u00abiojoso arrived at SMYRNA on the 9th, witn her daughter and twelve Lombard refugees. The whole party immediately left for Constantinople. AMERICA. UNITED STATES.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe mail-ship Europe has brought advices from New York to the 19th ult. Confess still remained inactive, and tlie discus- sion\u00c2\u00b0of the slavery question was apparently as far oiT bein\"- brought to a close, as on the first day of the debate. Loud complaints began to be made against the Government, for having allowed nearly five months of the session to have passed away without having carried some of the many impor- tant matters now requiring attention. The com- mittee of foreign i-elations were preparing a report on the free navigation of the St. Lawrence, and thev will probably recommend to the President to enter into negotiations concerning it with the British Government, l't was supposed that Eng- land was favourably inclined towards granting to the United States Government the privilege of Z, navigating that river.. In the United States Senate on the 17th, a violent/Iispute took place between Messrs. Benton and Foote, during which the lat- ter drew a pistol froni his pocket, and was \u00c3\u00b9hou: to discharge his contents at his opponent, when he was fortpnately seized and disarmed of the dan- gerous weapon. The tide of emigration from the Atlantic ports to the golden regions of California continued una- \"0 bated, No less than thirteen hundred people bad left New York in three vesels in two days. Serious fears as to the ultimate result began to be enter- tained, and a very general feeling prevailed, that even before the close of the coming summer, there would be received most alarming accounts of mis- ery, destitution, and consequent sacrifice of life. The papers contain no new facts respecting the Webster trial, but a general feeling prevailed that the extreme penalty of the law would be car- ried out. MEXICO.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe learn from Vera Cruz that General Santa Anna had declared his intention of abandon- ing politics, and returning to Venezuela: assigning his English as an embarrassing circumstance in his residence in Jamaica. A proposition had been made in the Mexican Congress for the abolition of punishment by death for all political offences, but it did not succeed. BRAZILS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLetters from Rio Janeiro, of March 15, state that the fever was very bad indeed in the city and suburbs; almost every family had lost one or more of its members, and its attacks had been more particularly fatal among the new comers. The shipping in port had suffered severely in their crews about twenty masters of crews had perished through its virulence. AFRICA. SENEGAL.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIntelligence has been received through France that an attack had been made by the na- tives of the coast against the inhabitants of St. Louis. The Governor, Capt. Baudin, was absent on an expedition in the upper part of the river, and the aggressors took advantage of the circum- stance to more readily accomplish their hostile projects. CHINA. The Overland Mail brings accounts of another dashing affair with the piratical junks in Mir's Bay, in which the Medea captured and destroyed thirteen of these formidable vessels, mounting from eight to eighteen guns each. In this last brush the pirates (Chinese) lost 220 men killed and twenty were made prisoners, two of whom after- wards died of their wounds. The destruction of the whole piratical force was accomplished without a single casualty on the side of the English. The official despatch from Captain Lockyer, R.N., to senior naval officer in China, furnishes ample de- tails of the manner in which this gallant action Z3 was achieved. INDIA. An express anticipation of the Overland Mail, reached London on Friday. The dates of the ac- counts which this mail brings are Calcutta the 22nd of March, and Bombay the 3rd of April. There is unpleasant news from the Punjaub. The expedition to Kohat, to bring into subjection the Afreedie tribes, after having at first partially succeed- ed, has, after all, failed in its object: it has not over- awed, it is said, but only irritated them. There is a lofty martello tower which supervises the pass on the direct road between Kohat and Peshawur. When our troops were about to return from their retributive expedition, it was considered necessary to garrison this fortalice. As soon, however, as the main body had retired, the tower was blockaded by the Afree- dies, and both provisions and water began to fail. Apprised to this state of affairs, Capt. Coke advanced iroui KoLa: and rrv.std the well as replenish- ed the larder and fiaggon of the besieged. Having performed his necessary duty, he returned to Kohat, but as soon as his lenti\" were struck, the place was reinve^Uvl hy tn; An-adies. About 2,000 men says the Lahore Chronicle, under the leadership of Derrea Khan, advanced towards the tower, under cover of regular breastworkes, erected step by step,- approached to within a few yards of the tower walls, and again cut off the supply of water, which was furnished by a single tank outside the walls. Capt. Coke was once more riraunoned, but finding his amu- nition scanty, resolved to withdraw the garrison by friendly negociation. Some Afreed'es of an amicable tribe were the media of communication, and their diplomacy proved effective. The tower was evacu- ated, and the Afreedies disbanded-of course crowing over their success. Sir Charles Napier was on his return to Lahore. His excellency had y availed himself of his power to disband the 66th N.I., the whole of the native officers and privates being struck off the rolls of the army. The place of the regiment does not, however, remain a blank in the Army List. TheGoorka corps, known as the Nuseree battalion, has been bodily placed under the command of the European officers of the 66th, and assumes the title of the 66th Goorka Regi- mentr The are uely reports (iays the Calcutta 8,tarJ. of a similar spirit displayed by other corps in the Punjab, but we have reason to believe they are entirely exaggerated,\" The same paper states that Jung Behadoor, the Nepalese Premier, had arrived in Calcutta. He proceeds with a large suite to England by the April steamer, leaving his brothers to rule at Katmandu in his room. Lord Dalhousie arrived in Calcutta on the 7th of March, and had been indefatigable in his attendance to his legislative duties. His Lordship, under exi- gencies of public service, proposed quitting Calcutta again in a. short time the Marchioness had already done so, travelling by land along the great trunk road. WEST INDIES, The West India mail has arrived, bringing accounts from Jamaica of March 7 Trinidad, March 6 and Barbadoes, March 9. The islands continued healthy. A trifling riot had taken place at Gray Town, but it was soon put down, and the ringleaders punished by a smart flogging. The Jamaica papers report, an important meeting at the town of Buff-bay, for the purpose of co-operat- ing with the National Association for the Protection of British and Colonial Industry and Capital. Upon the motion of the Rex. C. T. May, Rector, the Hon. J. R. Grosset was called to the chair,' who observed that the proceeding marked a new era, being the first time that a public meeting had taken place in Jamaica by invitation of an Association in the mother country. A resolution was moved by Mr. Hossack, and seconded by Mr. Sollas, accepting the invitation to co-operate with the Central Association. Mr. Mason, in proposing a resolution, reiterating their claims to protection, gave a remarkable statement of his own sufferings under the Free-trade policy :-For my own part (he said), Englishman as I am born and bred, I am painfully driven to the conclusion, after two-and-thirty years' residence here, that it would have been better now for me, if I had followed the bent of my youthful inclination when I arrived here, and have joined one of the then-called South American patriot expeditions. The cut-throat Governments of that miserable country could not sq grievously have oppressed and robbed us as the British Government have; for had I survived the struggle for independence, and saved anything, I should have taken good care to place a comfortable nest egg beyond their reach to support me in the decline of life. But how is it now with me, gentlemen ? Induced by the lying cajoleries of lordly aristocratic British Governors and statesmen, I embarked my all, and exerted all my energies to carry out a British scheme of emancipation. Well, gentlemen, the emancipation took place in 1834, and I received one-third of the cost of the slaves I then possessed and a British people have boasted of the sacrifice they then made ever since, quite forgetting the outrageous cnnfiscation they then inflicted on their feiiow-countrvmcn here, myself among the number. He then detailed the several measures, admitting slaye-grown produce to the detriment of theirs, which had. one after another, robbed them of all their property. BRITISH AMERICA. CANADA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe learn from Toronto that incessant rains with a rapid thaw of the snow for two days, had produced a great freshet in all the rivers in that part of the country, carrying a way bridges, mill-dams, quantities of timber, and other property in the vicinity. The Buffalo Commercial of the 5th April, contains a letter relative to the navigation ot the St. Lawrence river by American vessels, from a member of the Canadian government in which he says\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd American vessels are not now permitted to pass by our inland navigation to the sea, neither will special application lor that pur- pose be enlert-iined. The fact is, the authorities of this province look upon the free use of the St. Lawrence and inland navigation as a valuable con- cession, which should not be made without an ade- quate compensation.\" NOVA SCOTIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Legislature of Prince Ed ward's Island have voted a want of confidence, one! refused to grant supplies, until a responsible Government is given tfhem. A line of telegra ph incorporated by the government, has been esta- j blished between Halifax and Picton. AUSTRALIA. The Adelaide papers of the 24th December last, which have come to hand* are filled with the speeches delivered at a meeting of the colonists, held on the 21st of that month. Upon that occa- sion, so highly interesting and important to those more immediately concerned, many of the shops were closed, and business altogether suspended.

{"ocr": "CAOTION TO FARMERS HAVING DISEASED SHEEP.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd At the Tavistock Guildhall, last week, Walter Arthur ap- peared to a summons issued at the instance of Joseph Long-, before John Rundle, Esq., magistrate. Mr. Clul- cott, solicitor, said that this was an information laid at the instance of the committee appointed for the purpose of devising means to prevent the spread of scab or mange in sheep, against the defendant, who is a farmer residing in the parish of Marytavy, for having kept several sheep infected with that decease, on a common in the parish of Petertavy; and he further stated that the object of this proceeding was not to punish the defendant by pressing for a heavy penalty, but almply to give publicity to the Act of Parliament (38 Geo. I I I., c. 5) under which this information was laid, and thereby prevent, if possible, a repetition of the offence. Mr. Chilcott asserted that it was the wish of bis clients that the smallest penalty allowed by the Act should he imposed. Defendant then pleaded fuilty to the information, and was mitigated penalty of Os. (the lowest allowed by the statute) and 19s. 8d. for costs, which were immediately paid. It may not be amiss to make known to agriculturist and others keeping sheep, that thry are liable to a penalty of jgtO for turning out or keeping on commons sheep infected with scab or mange.

ATTEMPT TO COWBRT THE POPE!\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe corres- pondent of the Daily News, writing from Rome on the 2nd inst., gives the following singular account of an interview between a Protestant clergyman and the Pope :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" One of the most interesting occurrences of last week was the inter- view of the lley. Dr. Townsend, canon of Durham, with the Pope. I mentioned in a previous letter that the rev. doctor's object was to endeavour to induce his Holiness to do away with the bickerings, animosities, and polemical discords which keep the various tlenominationsofChristians separate and at enmity, and by calling a general council, to establish the basis of an universal creed. It was cer. tainlya bold atempt for a Protestant clergyman to convert the Pope himself, but the doctor was resolved to beard the lion in his den, and on Friday last he went to the en- counter in full dress canonicals. After having knelt to kiss the Pope's hand. Dr. Townsend was invited by his Holi- ness to take a chair, and an animated conversation com- menced in Latin, a fit language for controversy, and one in which the disputants might be presumed to be a match for each other. The Pope was upon the whole very tole- rant, as may be imagined from his having not only lis- tened with cahnness to Dr. Townsend's arguments in favour of releasing the Catholic clergy from their vow of celibacy, but also assured him that he entertained serious ideas of adopting such a plan in the early part of his reign, especially after having received pressin-r letters upon the subject from Germany, but that, in the present state of Italy, and indeed of the whole continent, any innovation on his part would be dangerous, even if he had the power to act freely, which he had not, being by no means the free agent that he was on his first accession to the throne. The same objection would prevent him from calling a general council, or attempting to unite the great and divided family of Christians, although he fully admitted the grandeur of the scheme, protested his own desire for peace and harmony, and wept at Dr. Townsend's enthusi- astic picture of England recognizing in Pio Nino the head of a universal church. After three quarter's of an hour's discussion, the rev. canon took his leave placing in the hands or his Holiness a document containing the princi- pal heads of his argument which appears to have made some impression on the pontiff's mind, judging from the fact of his having sent to the doctor's residence, on Sunday last, only two days after the interview requesting to be made acquainted with the period oMr. Townsend's re- turn (he has just gone to Naples), a Are: should like then to have some more conversation witlftim. THE BRIDGE OF MONKEYS. Stop a moment, capt.. -you shall see.\" The half-human voices now sounded nearer, and we could perceive that the animals were ap- proaching the spot where we lay. Presently they appeared upon the opposite bank, headed by an old grey chieftain, and officered like so many soldiers. They were, as Raoul had stated, of the comadreja, or ring-tailed tribe. One\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd an aide-camp, or chief pioneer, perhaps\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdran out upon a projecting rock, and, after looking carefully across the stream, as if calculating the distance, scampered back, and appeared to communicate with the leader. Thisprod'uced a movement in the troop. Commands were issued, and fatigue parties were detached and marched to the front. Meanwhile, several of the comadrejas\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdengineers, no doubt\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdnn along the bank, on both sides of the arrove. At length, they all collected around a tall Cottonwood, that grew over the narrowest part of the stream, and twenty or thirty of them scampered up its trunk. On reaching a high point, the foremost-a strong fellow-ran out upon a limb, and, taking several turns of his tail around it, slip- ped off, and hung head downwards. The next on the limb-also a stout one-climbed down the body of the first, and, whipping his tail tightly around the neck and fore arm of the latter, dropped off in his turn and hung head down. The third repeated this manoeuvre upon the second, and the fourth upon the third, and so on; until the last one upon the string rested his forepaw on the ground! The living chain now commenced swinging backwards and forwards, like the pendulum of a clock. The motion was slight at first, but gradually increased, the lowermost monkey striking his hands violently on the earth as he passed the tangent of the oscillating curve. Several others upon the limbs above aided the move- ment. This continued until the monkey at the end of the chain was thrown among the branches of a tree on the opposite bank. Here, after two or three vibrations, he clutched a limb, and held fast. This movement was exe- cuted adroitly, just at the culminating point of the oscil- lation, in order to save the intermediate links from the violence a too sudden jerk! The chain was now fast at both ends, forming a complete suspension bridge, over which the whole troop, to the number of four or five hun- dred, passed with the rapidity of thought! It was one of the most comical sights I ever beheld, to witness the quizzical expression of countenances along the living chain! The troop was now on the other side, but how were the animals forming the bridge to get themselves over ? This was the question that suggested itself. Manifestly by number one letting go his tail. But then the point d'appui on the other side was much lower down, and number one, with half a dozen of his neighbours, would be dashed against the opposite bank, or soused into the water. Here, then, was the problem, and we waited with some curiosity for its solution. It was soon solved. A monkey was now seen attaching his tail to the lowest on the bridge; another girdled him in a similar manner, and another, and so on, until a dozen more were added to the string. These last were all powerful fellows; and, running up toaliighlimb, they lifted the bridge into a position almost horizontal. Then a scream from the last monkey of the new forma- tion, warned the tail end that all was ready; and the nex moment the whole chain was swung over, and landed safely on the opposite bank. The lowermost links now dropped off like a melting candle, while the higher ones leaped to the branches and came down by the trunk. The whole troop then scampered off into the duppural, and disappeared! \"Aw, be the powers Moll Kelly! av thim little crayteurs hasn't more sinse than the humans ov these parts. It's a quare counthry any how. Be my sowl! it bates Bannagher intirely!\" A general laugh followed the Irishman's remarks and we all sprang to our feet, re- freshed by our sleep, and lighter in spirits. The storm had disappeared, and the sun, now setting, gleamed in upon us through the broad leaves of the palms. The birds were abroad once more-brilliant creatures\u00e2\ufffd\ufffduttering their sweet songs. Parrots and tronpicles flashed around our heads, and chattered in the branches above. The stream had become fordable, and, leaving our lair,\" we crossed over, and struck into the woods on the opposite side.-Ad- verdures of an Officer in Southern Mexico. THE BATTLE WITH THE BLOODHOUNDS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe stood for some moments gathering breath, nerving ourselves for the desperate struggle. I could not help looking over the precipice. It was a fearful sight. Below, in a vertical line, two hundred feet below, the stream rushing through the canon broke upon a bed of sharp, jagged rocks, and then glided on in seething, snow-white foam. There was .no object between the eye and the water no jutting ledge \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdnot even a tree to break the fall,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdnothing but the spiky boulders below, and the foaming torrent that washed them! It was some minutes before our unnatural enemies made their appearance, but every howl sounded nearer and nearer. Our trail was warm, and we knew they were scenting it on a run. At length, the bushes crackled, and we could see their white breasts gleaming through the leaves. A few more springs, and the foremost bloodhound bounded out upon the bank, and. throwing up his broad jaws, uttered a hideous \"growl.\" He was at fault where we had entered the water. His comrades now dashed out of the thicket, and, joining in a chorus of disappointment, scattered among the stones. An old dog-scarred and cunning\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdkept along the bank until he had reached the top of the canon. This was where we had made our cros-1 sing. Here the hound entered the channel, and, springing from rock to rock, reached the point where we had dragged ourselves out of the water. A short yelp announced to his comrades that he had lifted the scent, and they all threw up their noses and came gallopping down. There was a swift current between two borders of basalt. We had leaped this. The old dog reached it, and stood strain- ing upon the spring, when Lincoln fired, and the hound, with a short wough,\" dropped in upon his hedd, and was carried off like a flash! \"Counts one less to pitch roes,\" said the hunter, hastily reloading his rifle. Without ap- pearing to notice the strange conduct of their leader, the others crossed in a string, and, striking the warm trail, came yelling up the pass. It was a grassy cliff-such as is often seen between two tables of a cliff-and, as the dogs strained upward, we could see their white fangs, and the red blood that had baited them, clotted along their jaws. Another crack from Lincoln's rifle, and the fore- most hound truckled down the gorge. Two rubbed out,\" cried the hunter, and at the same moment I saw him fling his rifle to the ground. The hounds kept the trail no longer. Their quarrey was before them; their howling ended, and they sprang upon us with the silence of the assassin. The next moment we were mingled together,- dogs and men,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin the fearful struggle of life and death I know not how long this strange encounter lasted. I felt myself grappling with the tawny monsters, and hurling them over the cliff. They sprang at my throat, and I threw out my arms, thrusting them fearlessly between the shining rows of teeth. Then I was free again, and seizing a leg, and a tail, or the loose flaps of the neck, I dragged a sa- vage brute toward the brink, and summoning all my strength, dashed him against the brow, that he might tum- ble howling over. Once I lost my balance, and nearly staggered over the precipice; and at length, panting bleed- ing, and exhausted, I fell to the earth. I could struggle no longer. I looked around for my comrades. Clayley and Raoul had sunk upon the grass, and lay, torn and bleeding. Lincoln and Chane holding a hound, were balancing him over the bluff. Now, murter,\" cried the hunter; \"give him a good hoist, and see if we kin pitch him CIFir orit'other side, hee\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwoop,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwoo And with this ejaculation the kicking animal was launched into the air. I could not resist looking after. The yellow body bounded from the face of the opposite cliff, and fell with a heavy plash upon the water. Hewas the last of the pack !-Ibid. CHINESE TRADITION OF THE DELuoB.-In an ad. dress lately delivered in Dublin by Dr. Gutzlaff, that distinguished man, among other things, made the follow- ing statement:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLet them now look to the east of Asia, and there on its shores, washed by thePacinc, they would find China, an ancient nation, which has retained its cus- toms for over 2,000 years, with a strictness and attach- ment that would do honour to better things. In fact, the Chinese had a continual history even from the deluge up to the present time they had writers in all time and in all circumstances, and they had a language which, in its essential parts, had undergone very little change for the past 2,000 years. Was it not a wonder that this nation could exist so long, and could not be subdued by the storms that had swept over the plains of Asia ? The fear- ful inroads of barbarians who wasted and overthrew the Roman Empire in the West and in the East, all that the wisdom of the Hindoos had estdblished, did not annihilate or disperse his nation (for he called the Chinese his own nation). The invaders of China, instead of giving their triumph a national character, were obliged in time to amal- gamate with the Chinese, and thus this nation was pre- served in its purity. fhe Chinese history stated that there was at one time a great deluge, when the waters rose to the heavens and that the empire was then con- verted into a swamp, which a king called Shull gotdrnined by means of canals whose mouths opened into the seas and rivers. The date of this event only differed a few years from that generally assigned to the deluge. It was a confirmation of the truth of Holy Scripture, that so dis- tant a nation as the Chinese, who did not know from the Bible ot the occurrence of the great fall, should yet record the same event as that spoken of in Holy Writ. There were other coincidences also; such, for example, as the record of a great starvation, which took place about the time when Joseph was prime minister of Egypt. SERIOUS DISASTER.- -A mass of rock was to be blown tip in the port of Algiers, by means of gunpowder nearly four tons were placed in the mine, and great numbers of persons collected around to witness the explosion. It was expected that the rock would have been broken off in one large mass; btr, unhappily, it was shivered into a thousand fragments, which were hurled a long distance in every di- rection, falling among the spectators. Eight persons wi-re killed, and twenty-one wounded, some of them very se- riously. iVf. Jourdan, Juge d'histruction, was literally cut in two.

{"ocr": "THE MORMONS. The formation of a Mormon State in the upper part ot California, under the name of Deseret,\" which, it is probable, will shortly be admitted into the American Union, has again directed public attention towards this extraordinary sect. That ar. eniirelv new religious body shaull have sprung up., and attracted around it, within a few years, a host of zealots sufficiently numerous to con- stitute themselves into an independent State that this body should have been drawn together, not from Red Indians, nor Yankee entliusiats, nor Mexican hunters, nor Cannadian trappers, but, like the followers of Thorn, of Canterhury, mainlv from out of the bosom of our own English church, is one of the most startling of al! the \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2illustrations of the boasted march of intellect in this nineteenth century. It is true, Joe Smith, the prophet, was a cute Yankee, bred and born but the ranks of the Mormonites, or Latter J) ty Saints,\" are now recruited chiefly from the small farmers, the country artisans, and shopkeepers of England, who flock towards the staadard of the faithful,\" carrying with them capital, industry, energy, and character, whatever may be said of their mental discernment, or religious perceptions. We have now in England a large b<>dy ot Mormonite missionaries constrin,ly at work. much more zealous in their opera- tions than those who have better things to teach and every year sees an increasing number of Mormon con- verts leaving our shores to join the general body in the far distant wilds of California. Under such circumstances. a sketch of the rise and history of the Mormon faith may not be unteresting to our readers. Joe Smith, the founder ot the sect, was born in 1805, at Sharon, in the New England Sate of Vermont. About s ten years after, his parents removed to the neighbour- t hood of Palmyra, in the American State ot New York, 1 where they lived for several years. Joe grew up with the J tastes and habits of a \"loafer;\" he was an idle lounger at 1 -drinking-shups; ignorant, uneducated, coarse, and viscious. J He did no work, unless it was an occasional stroke at 1 money-digging,\" searching for hidden treasure, the favourite pursuit of vagabonds in every age. What had first turned his attention to the project of founding a re- ligious sect is not known; but, in the story of himself, which he afterwards gave to the world, he averred that the Spirit of the Lord found him at Palmyra, at the age of J fourteen or fifteen, and awakened him to religious thoughts by a miraculous vision. A subsequent revelation in 1823, disclosed to him that he was \"chosen of God\" as an in- strument of a new dispensation\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda dispensation which should fulfil and complete those heretofore vouchsafed in the Old and New Testaments. He was informed that the American Indians were a remnant of Israel, a branch of the tribe of Joseph: that they had beenconductedtothiscountry a civilised people, possessed of the true religion, and favour- ed of the Almighty: that they walked not in the ways of the Lord, but fell into all manner of wicked courses, and massacred one another in endless wars: that, at last, they were almost exterminated in a great battle, at a hill called Cummorah,\" 200 miles west of Albany, in the state of New York. and not far from Joe's residence in Palmyra and that the survivors degenerated into savage tribes, whom the Europeans found in possession of the country. It was further revealed to him, that the ancient re- cords of this people, which had been kept from time to time by their Seers and Prophets, were saved by Divine Providence, and hid up\" in the hill Cummorah 420, by Moroni, the son of Morman that, it, due time, these re- cords should be entrusted to him, and he should be ena- bled, by inspiration, to translate and publish them to the world and that, through his agency, the kingdom of the Latter Day Saints should be established, the New Jeru- salem built up, and the whole earth prepared for the final coming of Christ. After many alleged premonitory visions, the sacred plates were at last committed to this Moses of the Latter Day Covenant. With them he received a pair of specta- cles, by :he aid of which he was to interpret the records- these spectacles Joedesignated the \"Urim and Thummim.\" The sacred plates were said to be of gold, seven or eight inches square, scarcely so thick as common tin, bound to- gether like a book, atul secured by three rings running through one side or edge of the plates; the book being six inches thick. The plates were covered with Egyptian characters. After his establishment at Nauvoo (ot which hereafter) Joe procured some Egyptian mummies, and caused several sheets of papyrus, carved with hierogly- phics. to be framed with glass, like pictures. His mother, then in her dotage, kept these as an exhibition, and ex- plained to visitors,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwho always paid a gratuity\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe history of \"King Pharaoh, his wife, and datcr\" (being the mummies there present), and their connection with the children of Israel and the Latter Day Saints; her accounts of the Egyptian characters would certainly have astounded the learned historians of Europe and Asia! To return Joe commenced the work of the translation of the plates, which, after considerable delay, was at length accomplished, and an edition of 1,200 copies of the \"Book of Mormon,\" was published at Palmyra, New York, in 1830. Such is the date of this new Bible of the Mormon prophet. Another edition was afterwards published in England at Liverpool, under the auspices of three of the brethren there. This Mormon Bible contains the first and second books of Nephi, the books ot Jacob, Enos, Jarom, Omni, the works of Mormon, and the books of Mosiah, Zeniff, Alma. Helaman, Nephi (the second), Mormon, Ether, and Moroni. The whole is a prosy and awkward imitation of the Old Testament in subject, mat- ter and style; abounding in bad grammar, verbose, trifling, puerile conceits, stolen incidents, and palpable anach- ronisms. ronisms. There is every reason to believe that Joe Smith got the idea and most of the materials of this book, from a manu- script composed by the Rev. Solomon Spalding, some time a Congregational minister at Mason, Massachusetts, and also the head of an academy at that place, but who after- wards removed to New Salem, in Ohio, in 1812. While there, he regarded with much curiosity the antiquities found in the State, and indulged in speculations about their origin. At length he conceived the idea of a scrip- tural romance; taking up the lost tribes of Israel, re- moving them to America, and deducing from them an imaginary history. The Book of Mormon was the result; and, while composing it he often read portions of it to his wife and friends. At Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, to which he afterwards removed, the manuscript was for some time in the hands ot Mr. Patterson, the editor of a paper there; and, by him, was shown about, without any reserve. Among others, Sydney Rigdon, a compositor, read, and had abundant opportunities of copying the manuscript, which was afterwards returned to Mr. Spalding who died in 1816. Many years after, in the year 1828, Rigdon was work- ing at his trade at Palmyra, when the public began to hear rumours of Joe Smith's golden plates, and Rigdon shortly after joined him, when he assisted in the trans- lation\" until the date of its publication, and continued one of the most zealous coadjutators of the \"Prophet\" until near his death. The people of New Salem, how- ever, in the year 1834 were in no small degree surprised to hear certain passages read from the Book of Mormon by a female preacher, which they at once recognised as part of the deceased Mr. Spalding's manuscript.. A public meeting was held, and a committee appointed to visit Mrs. Spalding (now Mrs. Davidson) and compare the new revelations with the old romance. It was done accordingly, and the identity of the two fully established. Mrs. Davidson published, in 1839, a narrative of the whole history of her husband's manuscript; and its truth is at- tested by many credible witnesses. The only unaccount- able thing about it is, that a minister of the gospel should have written such an amount ot trash, and found people patii nt enough to listen to its reading. The names cf Mormon and Moroni have been sometimes referred to in confirmation ot this story. The first is a Greek word, meaning a frightfal mask, or, as children call it, a false tace,\" or \"scareface.\" The latter is supposed to be an anomalous formation from the Greek, moros, signifying a fool. Joe Smith, however, succeeded in getting his book pub- lished, and his scheme faitly launched. He obtained con- verts, the earliest of no grrater reputation than himself; but, Dy degrees, others of higher standing joined him,- some from hopes of profit others of influence. Mission- aries were set to work, who found a ready audience. Novelty, curiosity, love ot change, discontent, and the love of the marvelous, attracted many. The scriptural phraseo- logy of the new religion excited anew the slumber- ing spirit ot fanaticism in New England prophecies Were hazarded, miracles were promised, the gift of tongues was preached, the power of casting out devils was vouchsafed and a divine protection was offered against the poison of serpents, and the assaults of wild beasts; while all other -existing teachers of religion were denounced as impostors, and false guides. Such doctrines, preached with zeal, will not fail to attract a number of ignorant persons in any community; and, accordingly, the doctrins of Joe Smith prospered. The rebuilding of Zion was one of his grand dreams, but the Prophet made many mistakes as to its site. Pal- myra was its first location, next Kirtland, in Ohio, then in Missouri, afterwards at Nauvoo, in Illinois, and from tivence the Mormonites have wandered into the Califor- nian wilds, but still growing in numbers at every stage of their wanderings. As yet, all the prophecies have failed yet, sfill the faithful have hope. The Church is full of zeal, and the missionaries are eager. It was observed that wherever Joe and his followers have pitched their camp, as being the spot on which Zion was to be rebuilt, there the land was rich, and the prospects of increase great. They never, by any accident, aliphted on a barren spot, but gselected fertile lands, great \"water privileges,\" and a location abounding in wealthy settlers, enabling the Saints to \"milk the Gentitps,\" as the process of sucking them was facetiously termed in the levelations of Joe. In Kirt- land, they established a bank, the Prophet being presi- dent, and Sidney Rigdon cashier. It was established in obedience to one of Joe Smith's \"'Revelations given in Zion, July, 1S31,\" wherein Sidney Gilbert was divinely \"appointed to receive monies,\" Edward Partridge to divide the Saints their inheritance the aforesaid Sid. ney Gilbert furthermore to estahlish a store,\" \"that he may obtain money to bay lands for the good of the Saints,\" and with that view, to \"obtain a license, that he may send goods also unto the people;\" and, finally, it appointed, in vearse 5 as follows And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant William W. Phelps, be planted in this place, and be established as a printer unto the church,\"&c., These revelations of the Prophet were generally a strong exposition to the Saints, to mind the main chance which they were not slow to Jay to heart. Hut the Kirtland bank fared no better than the Heathen BiHlks around it; the country was flooded with its paper, while the bank vaults were innocent of specie. The hold- ers of the notes never got a farthing; and the Saints, after \"milking the Gentiles,\" decamped to Missouri to build another Zion. Meanwhile, their\" church\" had been licked into shape, and there was the Prophet, the Patri- arch, the Melchisedec, and the Aaronic priesthood, High Priests, and Presidents, the Twelve Apostles, the Quorum of Seventy, Bishops, Elders, Priests, Deacons and Teach- ers, whose respective duties were prescribed to them through the medium of frequent divine revelations to Joe. and occasionally to other men high in office. By order of these so called revelations, special provision was made for the support of these persons, and, as may easily be anti- cipated, the Prophet and his family were not forgotten. Removed, or \"absquauilaled,\" to Missouri in 1834, the .Mormons established the towns of Far-west and Adam- \u00e2\ufffd\u00a0ondihamart. Dissensions here sprang up between the Saints and the Gentiles, which continued to increase in frequency and violence during their residence in the Western States. The Gentiles refused to be \"mitred\" patiently, and were very indignant to see the laws of their State, fot the check and punishment of dishonesty and knavery, set at defiance. At length the Mormons posi- tively refused obedience to the officers and processes of Alie law they fortified their town, Md prepared to de- fend themselves bv force. The militia of the State were called out under Gener il Doniphon, who h is since so dis- tinguished himself in Mexico, and, after some warlike demonstrations, Joe Smith surrendered himsdf a prisoner to an-iwer the various charges ot felony ot which lie was accused, and his people dispersed to seek a refuge beyond the limits of Missouri. Th,'y wandered into the adjoin- ing State < f Illinois, and began to arive in Quincy and its vicinity during the winter 01 1S38-9. Tiiey were very poor, iii-dad. and destitute of food. Describing their i wrongs ,d sufferings in the oust moving terms, and ex- t hibitinga deportment of the greatest humility, the inha- bitants of the district were tilled with compassion, and large contributions in money and necessaries were made for their support. They were employed on farms, in workshops, in private famiiies, and everybody thought thev would ere long be absorbed in the general population of the country. At this juncture, early in the spring of 1839, Joe Smith escaped from prison in Missouri, and fled into Illinois. Here he held a great gathering of his fol- lowers a few miles from Quincy, at an old camp-meeting ground, and he addressed them, as well as the sucked,\" in an oily speech. It was not free from impudence, and even blasphemy. Referring to one of his followers, who had professed to have \"revelations\" during his im- prisonment, and seemed to be ambitious of acting as suc- cessor to Joe, he said, I don't know anything about his revelations. God can ^ive revelations, if He pleases; this may he true or it may be false. I don't know anything about it. I can't be everywhere at once. God Almighty must attend to some of those things himself!\" Again was a new site for the Holy City chosen, and Nauvoo was the favoured spot. This is said to be a Hebrew word, signifying The Beautiful.\" Certainly the situation is very beautiful. Those who have witnessed the Panorama of the Mississippi, recently exhibited in London, will remember the commanding situation of the Temple, on a high bluft, near the banks of the river, slop- ing gradually down into a level bottom, and surrounded by a bend in the Mississippi about five or six miles long. The view trom the temple, in every direction, is very lovely. On the opposite shore is Fort des Moines (now Montrose) in Iowa, situated in a prairie bottom, stretching several miles to to the west, and shut in by an amphi- theatre of hills. Eastward, a belt of timber almost two miles wide circles it about, and beyond it lies an open prairie, some eighteen miles across, and extending almost indefinitely to the north and south. In three or four years there sprung up on this site a Mormon city, as if by magic. Houses of brick, and wood, and stone, were scat- tered over a surface of about three miles square, inhabited in 1814 by not fewer than 15,000 souls. The Temple itself was an imposing and costly structure of white marble, surmounted by a cupola, and a magnificent portico of Corinthian colums.

THE DUKE OF MONMOUTH'S POCKET BOOK.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe British Museum has recently become possessed of the memorandum book which was found in the pocket of the unfortunate Duke of Monar<mth, at the time he was taken prisoner hy the troops of James II. it in about six inches loug by four broad, and the cover is black leather, It contains some 40 or 50 pages, most of which are written upon by the Duke; but what gives it peculiar authenticity is an inscription on a fly leaf, in the handwriting of the King himself, stating that it was taken from the pursou of the Lhike of Monmouth, after the battle of Sedgmoor. After his abdicatiou Jatnes II. seems to have presented the little volume to a monastery in Paris, where it was preserved with religioni care uutil subsequent to the late revolution. The contents are of a very vaiied description, and sin- gularly illustrative of the character of the noble writer, The relic has only been in this country a few weeks. A grand banquet was given at Willis's rooms ou Satur- day, by upwards of two hundred military and naval offi- cers, to the Duke of Richmond, in consequence of his exertions In obtaining medals for those who served in the Peninsula war. After the repast, LicAitenant-General Lord Saltouu, who presided, presented to his Grace a handsome centre-piece of plate, valued at fifteen hundred guineas.

MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT ON THE THAMES.-\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA me- lancholy occurrence took place some few miles down the river, off Holyhaven. A vessel called the r lora was beat- ing up the river from Wales, when she went ashore uear the haven, and the crew immediately proceeded to put a kedge out in order lo get her oil. They lowered the boat, and were in the act of arranging the kedge, when a smack came foul of them. The boat was instantly capsized, and we regret to announce that two ol tiie poor fellows, named Charles Lush, of Poole, and Charles Thomas, of South- ampton, were drowned. We have not heard that their bodies had been rt-covered. STRANGE ACCIDENT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAn accident happened on the Dumbartonshire Railway on Monday evening, by which eight persons were more or less injured. It appears that the train, after passing Dumbarton, was suddenly divided by the simple unscrewing of a nut. whereby the bolt coupling the tender to the carriages became loose, and, (ailing out, the engine shot ahead of the train. On ob- serving this, the engine-driver immediately put on his break and brought to. without taking into consideration that the caniages had still considerable way upon them. The train, however, soon overtook the engine by the momentum it had, and before he could get out of the way the tender was run into. Several of the carriages were considerably damaged, injuring some of the passengers as already described.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdNorth British Mail. ACCIDENT AT SEA. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd We regret to record a melancholy disaster which took place last Wednesday in n gale of wind and stormy weather very unusual for this season of tbe year. About 6*30 p.m. a sloop was seen to lounder oil* Penberth, and, as no boat was seen either before or alter the melancholy accident, there was every reason to believe that the crew had perished. This supposition has since turned out to be too true, for it has been ascertained that the unfortunate vessel was the Plymouth Packet, Captain Wil- liam Hitchens, laden with granite and bound for Sciliy. None of the bodies of the crew (three in number) have, up to the hour of writing, been washed ashore. There was an awful sea running off the Land's End ou the above evening and the sloop was standing to the soulhwa'd and eastward, and very deep. The lugger Olivia, which was running for Gwavas Lake, and had observed the disaster, hauled to the spot, and discovered a man holding on a water keg, and they managed to throw him a rope, but life was apparently extiuct, ,as be made n,\" effort to grasp it. Some few floating articles were picked up by the Olivia, but she did not kllow the vessel at the time, and after a fruitless search was obliged to run for her own safety.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdCornwall Gazette. COLONEL SKINNER'S ADVENTURES.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe following is a touching episode from the campaign of 1800, when Col. Skinner was serving under the Mahrattas, against the Sikhs. He was iu the command of an independent force, but being deserted by his infantry, and attacked by an overwhelming Sikh force, he was obliged to retreat. The two battalions of the, enemy that were near me had been joined by the Rajah himself, with about 1000 horse, who charged me several times as 1 commenced to retreat. I repulsed them, but with the loss of one gun, which broke down, and of my own horse, mortally wounded, though it stlll kept on; but the remainder of their battalions now coming fast up, I found further progress itnpossible, and drew up in a line plain to receive them. Here I made a short speech to the men: I told them we were trying to avoid a thing which none could es- cape\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd that was death that come it would, and as such was the case, it became us to meet it, and die like soldiers. Thus resolved, we allowed the enemy to come within fifty yards, when we gave them a vulley and charged. Those in our front gave way, and we cap- tured thcirguns. As those on the flanks, however, now galled us with their cannon, I threw myself into a square, and sought to gain the ravines, now only about half a cos from us. But fate had decided against us. I [ley pressed us so close on all sides that my men began to lose their coolness we were charged too, and lost three more of our guns. Still, with the one left I kept moving on, and got clear of the enemy's infantry, who had got a little sickened, and showed less disposition to chase; but the cavalry kept on charging, and my men giving up very fast. I still had 30'J good soldiers and my gun left, but a party of horse pressed us so hard, that I moved out with a hundred men and stopped them but when I looked back, I found that only ten had followed me\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe rest had turned back and joined the gun. As I was going to follow them, a horseman galloped up, matchlock in hand, and shot me through the groin. I fell, and became insensible immediately; and, after my fall, the poor remains of my brave but unfortunate fellows met the same fate. I do not believe that fifty men out of the 1000 escaped from the field untouched.\" PAUL'S EVERY MAN'S FRIEND, (Corn Plaister,) may be relied on as a speedy and certain cure for those painful and stubborn annoyances Corns and Bunions, causing the lame and afflicted to walk with comfort.

The Royal standard was hoisted at the Tower, the Mouurnent, Somerset-house, the Admiralty, the spires ol the Churches of St. Martiu's-in-the-Ftelds, St. Margaret's, St. J'unes's, at her Majesty's Theatre in the Ha) market, the Royal It ilian Opera, Covent-garden, the Thettre Royal, Drury- t nte, and the usual public placeiy At oue o'clock the Park guns fired a Royal salute, wiich was responded to by those of the Tower, the Artillery-ground, Finsbury- square, the batteries of Woolwich, and Her Majesty's ships of war. The vessels in the river and the docks, both British and foreign, had their variegated pendants flying on the occasion. ALARMING ACCIDENT ON THE NORTH-WESTERN RAIL- WAY The quarter past 10 o'clock train on Siturday from Euston-square. when on its way northwards, about two miles beyond Wolverton, met with an accident, fortunately unattended with serious injury to any one, hut which for a moment excited the most serious alarm. From some un- explained cause the luggage on the top of one of the car- riages caught tire, and the flames spread with great rapidity. In one of the compartments of the next carriage behind it were seated Mr. Paxton, Mr. Bass, M.P.. and Mr. Cochrane, the active superintendent in the building of the Crystal Palace, and Mr. Crampton, the engineer of the Submarine Telegraph Company from Dover to Calais. These gentle- men were on their way to share in the dinner given to Mr. Fox at Derby, and while chatting pleasantly together were suddenly startled by hearing shrieks and seeing flakes of fire drifted across the windows of their compartment. Mr. Crampton guessing what was the matter, and comprehend- ing at once the danger, with a coolness and daring highly praiseworthy, opened the door, and leaping from carriage to cani\u00c2\u00bbge by the aid of the footbridge, made his way past that which was in flames, and was approaching the engine, when he was observed by the guard a,id driver, who, as soon as possible, stopped the train. In the meantime, his compa- nions had a nairow escape of it, for the flames found their way into the compartment which he had le:t open, and set the clothes of the inmates on fire in several places. They had the greatest difficulty in extinguishing the sparks and flakes of tire that had found their way in, but beyond some singes and a blister or two no personal injury was sutfered. Had it not been for Mr Crampton's presence of mind, however, very melancholy consequences might have re- sulted.Perhaps, when the ingenious conceiver of the Crystal Palace had been reduced to adies, some mea,ures might have been taken to secure the long-desiderated means of communicition between driver and guard of which this is another example. As it was, all the passengers were greatly frightened, and several had to deplore the destruc lion of their luggage.

Lord Palmerston,\" the Jlur/lillg Herald observes, has been the spoilpd child 01 office. For four-and. forty years of his lite he has enjoyed substantial advantages \u00e2\ufffd\u00a0of power, and this official experience, while it has afforded h1m aptitude, 11 vast command of lacts, great readiness, in- finitp plausibility, and habits of activity and labour vpry rare a- his time 01' life, has a1!!0 given him ao overwhelming confi. dence ill his own powers, and i1 dashing, hap hazard, devil- may-careish sort of manner, which too often amounts to ras\u00c3\ufffd1nes!! and precipitancy, if not occasionally to outrageous brusquerie and ill manners. The noble viscount has heen so long in office that he feels himself more than at home in it. and consequently very often takes liberties. Now, although conduct such as this may be endured fora season in a Home or Colonial Minister, yet such a bearing cannot belong tolerated in R Secretary d State for Foreign Affairs. h that otfiee discietion, judgment, temper, impassibility, and reliableness are more necessary than in any other.

In the miserable and disgraceful serips of transactions reviewed last night in the House of Lords. is reflected, as an entire landscnpe may be mirrored in a puddle, the whole perverse, capricious, and untrustworthy policy which has ruled at the Foreign Office during the IlIst fOllr years.

In California, new ami rich mines continue to be dis- covered in seemingly inexhaustible numbers. An order has been issued by the supreme government of India, discontinuing in the army the morning dram of arrack. The Paris Sciicle speaks of a rumour that the President of the Republic is to have an interview with Queen Vic- toria, at Jersey. A correspondent of the lioston Traveller announces the appearance of the sea-serpent in the vicinity of Kenne- bunk Point, Maine. Knrfio Tamis, minister of public worship and Instruc- tion at Athens, has been shot. The accounts from Morocco state that a great agitation prevails there. The Emperor's authority was disregarded in the greatest part of Fez, and the taxes are nut paid. Accounts from lierlin of the 2nd instant state that the King of Prussia ha.1 announced his determination to make no further concessions of any description to Austria. It is stated in some of the German journals that Hay- nau's visit to London was for the express purpose of testing the state of public feeling towards him. The electric telegraph between Vienna and Cracow has jugt been completed, and the first despatch over it\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda mi- litary one\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwas received by the minister of war from Cracow in five minutes. The Duke de Montpensier was deeply a/fecred at the news of his father's death, so much so that it was lound necessary to bleed him. The event is likewise severely felt by Queen Christina. There are, it is estimated, 11,000 individuals connected with the omnibus labour of London. Of these 6,000 are drivers and conductors, who work on an average, more than sixteen hours a day. In Mexico the cholera h 'd nearly ceased hut the deaths by its previous ravages were no less than IS 000. The Mexican congress had been regularly installed, and urgent measures set on foot to replenish the treasury and restore the credit of the government. At the Plymouth police court, a few days ago, a barber named Isaac, against whom a complaint had been made for mutilating a little girl's hair, by cutting off several long ringlets, when he was only requested to thin out the hair, was fined 4s. and costs, and ordered to return the ringlets.

When abuut a quarter of a mile un the Deal road, the post-horses in his Grace's carriage sud- denly took fright at the sight of some ballads posted upon a board by the road side for sale during the races, rhe post-boy lost the command of his horses, and the carriage was precipitated from the road into a stubble-field. One of the horses fell, and the post-boy was thrown under the carriage, but escaped unhurt. The Duke was not injured, and proceeded at once to Walmer. ASCENT OF MONT BLANC.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdGalignanis Messenger contains an interesting account of the ascent of Mont Blanc hy a Mr. Gretton, late of the 5th Fusileers, and Mr. Richards, of Wexford. Accompanied by experienced guides, they 'accomplished the dangerous exploit amid great eclat, resting one night, as usual, on their way up- wards on the rock of the Grand Mulets. By half-past seven on the following day they returned in safety, and were triumphantly received. We understand that Mrs. Macready, the esteemed ma- nageress of the Biistol, Bath, and Cardiff theatres, has received from the War-office an elegant medal, earned hy her deceased son when with the army in the Sutlej. It was accompanied hy an exceedingly handsome note, sta- ting that the medal had been granted for Assistant.

The Worcester great city and county bazaar in aid of the improvement of one of the approaches to the city at All Saints' Church, commenced on Saturday, and termi- nated on Tuesday. The shire-hall was the place chosen for the exhibition, and everything that taste or skill could devise was effected to render the magnificent hall a source of atiractinn, the general decorations being in the Eastern style. The fineness of the weather, and the annual meet- ing of the Worcestershire Regiment of Cavalry, contribu- ted to attract large numbers of the neighbouring gentry to the city, which was greatly crowded throughout the day. The total proceeds were nearly \u00c2\u00a3200, and it was compu- ted there were 1200 victors during the day. The Festival of the three choirs of Gloucester, Worces- ter, and Hereford terminated on Friday night, or rather on Saturday morning, at Gloucester, with a grand fancy and full-dress ball, and proved one of the most successful meetings ever held in that city. The whole of the morn- ings' performances of sacred music were attended by large audiences, and this was especially the case on Friday, when tbe oratorio of The Messiah was performed, and the Cathedral was filled in every part\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdnave, aisles, and wes- tern gallery. The collections made for the Charity for the Relief of the Widows and Orphans of Clergymen of the dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, and Gloucester, were larger than the collections at Hereford last year. The daily amounts collected at the doors of the Cathedral were \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdTuesday morning, \u00c2\u00a322a Is. 6d.; Wednesday morning, JE152 8s. Gd.; Thursday morning, JE142 13s. Gd.; Friday morning, JE344 3s.-total, \u00c2\u00a3862 6s. 6d, The collection after The Messiah is unprecedented. During the per- formance of this oratorio a cathedral robin was fluttering about over the heads of the people. At the last Gloucester Festival in 1847, the collections made for the Charity were JE688 2s. lid., thus showing an increase on the present occasion of no less than \u00c2\u00a3176 3s. 7d. It should he un- derstood that these collections go entirely to the Charity, without any deduction whatever on account of the general expenses of the Festival, which are defrayed out of the receipts from the sale of tickets. These, however, seldom realise sufficient for the purpose, and the deficiency has to be made up by the stewards, who are this year fourteen in number. It is expected that their liability will be very light. ANECDOTE OF THE LATE SiR R. PEEL.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdSir Robert proposed to have portraits taken of some of the principal fri.mJII Mod colleagues with wtwm he had been assuciated in public life, and for this purpose sent for one of the most eminent artists of the day in that department. The portraits were to be ten in number; and, after generally explaining his wishes, he asked what would be the price? Three hundred guineas each,\" was the aDswer. Very well.\" He took up a piece of paper and wrote\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\"there is a cheque for fifteen hundred guineas in the meantime. You may begin with Lord Hardinge, who is soon to go out to India.\" He handed the cheque as quietly and freely as if it had been merely an order for admission to the gallery of the house of Commons\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" thus,\" added the gentleman, when relating the circumstance, \"at the very first, and without remark or preface, giving me as good as an annuity of 75 guineas per annum.\" THE CIIUUCH OF ENGLAND.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe schism in the Church of England, which the Literary Gazette long ago and repeatedly predicted, from the signs of the times, to be almost an inevitable consequence of the conflicting opinions entertained on every subject and on every band, appears to be assuming a very tangible and operative form. We are, in common, we presume, with all the world, pre- sented with a prospectus of a reforming association, calling itself The Wtcklijfe Club, which declares its objects to be It recasting of the Prayer-book au\u00c3\u00b9 Catechism, u remodel- ling of the relations between the Church and State, a modification of the Episcopacy, and the erection of a hierarchical Government above all other human control. Many other hardly minor changes are announced, inclu- ding an Equalization of Church Property, a veto of Parishioners on the appointment of Ministers by Patron- age (which patronage it is proposed to correct), and a variety of farther reformations, all to be effected in the name of the Moat High and the Saviour, whose true worshippers and interpreters the members of the Wicklift'e Club affirm and proclaim themselves to be. This is the movement we foresaw.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLiterary Gazette. A VERY OLD SOLDIER.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe most remarkable cha- racter in the whole establishment (Hospice de Vieillards, at Brussels), was an old Dutchman named Jan Hermann Jankens, who was born at Leyden in the year 1735. At the time when I saw him he was 109 years of age. His faculties were unimpaired, and he was a remarkable exam- ple of that vigorous organization which sometimes mani- fests itself in the human frame; and which excites our wonder when we find that such delicate structures as the nerves of sight and hearing may b.. used for the space of a century without wearing out. Until within two years of the time when I saw J an kens, he had been able to work well and actively. His hand was firm and steady, and he frequently wrote letters to his distant friends. When in his 107th year, be thought very reasonably that he might give up his work. And what do you do now ?\" I in- quired. \"I enjoy my life,\" replied he \"I saunter about the whole day long, singing, smoking, and amusing my- self. I spend my time very gaityl\" His memory was stored with recollections of events connected with the marriage of Louis XVI.; for, when a soldier in the Aus- trian service, be had formed one of the military escort which conducted Marie Antoinette in France. He sang me an old song, which had been composed in honour of the Royal nuptials, and which he said was very popular at the time. It was in the usual styte of such effusions; a mere string of hyperbolic compliments, in praise of the \"beauteous princess\" and the \"illustrious priuce.\" It sounded like an echo from the grave of old French roy- alty. Jankens sang this song in a remarkably clear, strong Household Words.\" ELECTRO MAGNETISM AS A MOTIVE POWER.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdPro- fessor Page, in the lectures which he is now delivering be- fore the Smithsonian Institution, states that there is no longer any doubt of the application of this power as a substitute for steam. An immense bar of iron, weighiog 1601b., was made to spring up by magnetic action, and to move rapidly up and down, dancing like a feather in the air, without any visible support. The force operating upon the bar he stated to average 3001b. through ten in- ches of its motion. He said be could raise this bar 100 feet as readily as ten inches, and he expected no difficulty in doing the same with a bar weighing one ton, or a hun- dred tons. He could make a pile-driver, or a forge ham- mer, with great simplicity, aod could make an engiue with a stroke of 6, 12, 20, or any number of feet. He exhibited his engiue of between four and five horse power, operated by a battefry contained within a space of three cubic feet. It looked very unhke a magnetic machine. It was a reciprocating engine of two feet stroke, and the whole engine and battery weighed about one ton. When the power was thrown on by the motion of a lever the engine started off magnificently, making 114 strokes per minute; though, when it drove a circular saw, ten inches in diameter, sawing up boards an inch and a quarter thick into laths, the engine made but about 80 strokes per minute. The force operating upon this great cylinder throughout the whole motiou of two feet was stated to be 600 Ib, when the engine was moving very slowly; but he had not been able to ascertain what the force was when the engine was running at a working speed, though it was considerably less. The m'lst important and interesting point, however, is the expense of the power. Professor Page stated that he had reduced the cost so far that it was less than steam under many and most conditions, though not so low as the cheapest steam engines. With all the iraperfectiuns of the engine, the consumption of 31b. ot zinc per day would produce one-horsepower. The larger his engines, contrary to what has been known before, the greater the economy. Professor Page was hinselt sur- prised at the result. There were yet practical difficulties to be overcome, the battery ItS yet to be improved, and it remains yet to try tbe experiment on \u00c2\u00bb grander \u00c2\u00abcale-- to make a power of 100 bone or more.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdiwwra/ InteUi\u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 qfncer (American papery THE PEDESTRIAN AT TBANMERE -lamea Sesrles, the Leeds pedestrian, had, up to last night, accomplished more than one-fourth of the thousand miles which lie has under- taken to walk in a thousand hours. By the conditions of the match which Searles first undertook, there wa< no sti- pulation as to what period or the hour the mile was to be performed, and had nothing interfered to vary these condi- tions, an hour and a hairs rest would have been secured to the pedestrian after walking two miles. Confident, lion ever, of h's success, Searles has made another match, undertaking to perforin the feat in a manner exactly similar to that which was accomplished lately by Manks, at Sheffield. He commences to walk the mile exactly at the hour, and, of course, he has only about three-quarters of an hour for rest, sleep, or refreshment. So far he continues its capital spirits. He has an excellent appetite; his food consists principal'^ of flesh meat; he touches neither ale nor spiiits; and never excee Is a couple of glasses of sherry a day. He bus been visited by Dr. Roper, of Birkenhead, and will be attended daily by that gentleman up to the clotte of his task He walks the mile, on an average, in about fifteen minutes. The minimum time, so far, is ten and a half ininuies; and the maxim urn twenty and a half minutes. The field, which has been enclosed, is well adapted for fit- purpose. A walk has been cut specially, and the ground staked off. The pe- destrian has to go four times round the field to complete the mile; and, in order to make his task as agreeable as pos- sible, especially in wet weather, the course ha* been care- fully cindered over, and the gtotind rendered Poli-I. There are eight men in charge of the match\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdfour on the part of Searles and four who represent the men who have staked their money. Of course, these relieve each other during the d'y and night. At dusk the pedestrian walks upon th* hitth road. This is done in order to prevent any dispute, because unless there was a man stationed at several of tl < posts at the turnings of the field, Searles might cross the course, and thus evade part of the distance. Now, however, as soon as it is impossiale to see him traverse the cotir-e from the other end, he wlIlk. half a mile on the road lead- ing to Rock Ferry, aod returns again. A timekeeper is stationed at the end of the half-mile to take care that 'he distance is faithfully accomplished, and another at the starting point to see that it is begun and ended fairly. The arrangements to prevent ay mistake or quibble appear to be perfect. For the accommodation of Searles a comfortable little cabin had been fitted \"pill an outhouse at the corner of the field. Here he has a bed, fire, clock, and all the other n\u00c2\u00bb-ces\u00c2\u00abary conveniences. Once a day water is brought from the river, and he is stripped and carefully wa-lieti over. When he throws himself on the bed to sleep during the night, he oool gets into a deep sluiuher; but so accustomecl is he in getting to his work, that be sometimes awakes of himself three or four minute. before the time has expired for the recommencement of his task. We need scarcely sav that many thousands of per- sons from this side of the water have visited the ground'. On Sunday Me^sr*. Willoughby ran three boats all day, and they were densely rrowded, a\u00c2\u00bb also were the Corpo- ration boats. Except a few who managed to get along the line of railway which overlooks the field, all strangers wt'N doomed to disappointment, as a promise had been made to the magistrates, by the persons interested, that the rub- ) c would not be admitted on the Sundays, aud this promise, we understand, ha.

{"ocr": "FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Paris papers of Thursday have been received. The President of the Republic held on Wed- nesday a farewell review of the regiments of the garrison about to leave the capital. The Prince accompanied by the Ministerof Wat, Generals Magnanand Roguet, and the Generals commanding the brigades to which those corps belonged, arrived at the Champ de Mars at twelve o'clock, where four regiments of infantry were drawn up on the right.andthreeregiments of cavalry on the left. After riding in front of the two lines, the President proceeded to the centre of the ground, and there distributed crosses of the Legion of Honour to a number of officers and soldiers who acknowledged the favour by cries of Vive Napoleon He then took his station at the Military School, and the seven regiments defiled before him. The President was well received by the people.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe trial of the Avenement for a libel on the Government, has ended in the condemna- tion of the editor to six months' imprisoument. The pub- lisher of the Presse has been alike condemned by default.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Don Enrique, of Spain, and his wife, the Duch;ss of Seville have arrived in Paris, and alighted at the Hotel des Princes to remain until after the accouchement of the Princess. The Paris papers of Friday are devoid of intelligence of interest. Nothing is known as to the intention of Louis Napoleon on the question of the electoral law; but it is understood there is a great division on this subject in the Republican party. It was rumoured on the Exchange that the Government are about to place some of the departmental in a state of siege.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdM. Victor Place, lately appoiuted Con- sul of France at Moussol, has taken his departure from the capital, with instructions to direct the new excavations about to be made at Nineveh, aud for which a sum has been voted by the National Assembly. He is to be joined at Moussol by the members of the Scientific Committee about to explore Assyria, Babylonia, Mesopotamia, Chal- dica, and Medea.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdPrivate letters from Malta mention the arrival of Kossuth and his companions on board of the Mississippi on the 21st inst.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Roman Observer of the 17th inst. states that in the afternoon of the 9th, two individuals wbo formerly belonged to the lJand commanded by Forbes, had attacked a peaceable inhabitant of Terni, named lios- chi, and pierced him with twelve wounds, which fortunate) v were not dangerous. The intended assassins were imme- diately apprehended.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Fresh shocks of earthquake were felt in the Neapolitan territories on the night of the 6th instant. The Pays contains a long article on the great question of the revision of the Constitution that will soon come before the assembly a second time. Amongst other things which that terrible and inevitable law reqniies from the Execu- tive and Legislative are the following:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" Louis Napoleon Bonaparte willllddress a message to the Assembly. It will be full of respect for the Constitution. He will patriotically and loyally repudiate all idea of overturning it, or even of falsifying or evading it. He will recognise that this Consti- tution, issuing from the sovereignty of the nation, cannot be modified or changed but by the entire nation. He will in vite the French people to fulfil all their duties while exer- cising all their rights and their legal representatives to pay due regard to the opinion which inspires and which judges them. He will announce to the people that they must not pass the limits of the law which binds them. In one word, he will render a complete, solemn, aud disinterested hum- age to the Republic of which he i\u00c2\u00ab the chief and to the nation of which he is the elect. The day following this message 100 representatives of the people will deem it a point of honour to sign the following proposition for imme- diate presentation:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd'The Legislative Assembly resolves that the Constitution of the French Republic ought to be partially revised. In consequence, a Constituent Assembly, named by all the electors inscribed on the etectoral iists made out in conformity with the law of the 15th of March, 1849, shall assemble ou the 15th of February next.' Fifteen days after the presentation of that proposition it will be voted by 600 majority. This is not merely an affirmation of ours; it is necessity which requires it. We do not hazard a pro- phecy, we state a mathematical certainty. We will prove it. The proposition cousins two acts of an inseparable chuac. ter, viz., the repeal of the law of May 31, and the revision of the Constitution. 446 votes declared in July last that on the revision of the Constitution depended the salvation of the country, and 231 that the re\u00c2\u00bbi-iou was a violation of public rights; that it was a pubic danger, a cause almost certain of future revolution. We find, therefore, 446 on one side, who make the salvation of France depend on the re- vision of the Constitution, and on the other 231 who make the maintenance of public order depend on the repeal of the law of the 3Istof.May. Will the 446 representatives who believe that France is saved if the revision be voted, refule that revision when they can obtain it by the sacrifice of a law w.thout authority, without efficacy-which the greater part of them prooounce to be vicious, impracticable, and daugerou\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand which a mere sentiment of amour propre prevents them trom openly condemning and abandoning? Will the 231 representatives who believe that a new revo- lution must, be avoided if universal suffrage be restored, re- fuse the repeal of the law of the 31st of May when they can obtain it by granting the revision without dinger to the Republic\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdnot as a concession of ri^hf, but as a new recog- nition of the principle of the sovereignty of the people, of which it is the leg^l expression and the iivingandnatura) form? No the revisionists will not refuse the revision at the price of the law of the 3Istof May; nor yet will the republicans refuse the repeal of the law of the 31st of May at the price of the revision. Both the one and the other will comprehend the responsibility that such a refusal must impose on them They will feel that to reject the arbitra- tion of the nation is their own condemnation.\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdM. de la Gueronniere then goes on to show that there would be nothing dangerous to republican institutions nor to society in such a compromi-e between the two parties. PORTUGAL.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Peninsular Mail steamer Madrid has brought intelligence from Lisbon to the 19th inst. The prospects of the Septembrists were more favourable, arising from the fact that the Queeu had sent for the Duke of Ter- ceira, to whom she expressed her great displeasure that his Grace should have joined the Cabralite faction. Her Ma- jesty felt it necessary 10 give the Duke this reproof, because she said, as he was holding a high office at Court it would lead the public to believe that she wa< clandestinely encou- raging the Cabralite party, which she altogether renounced, because she was satisfied that the feeling of the country was opposed both to Count Thomar and his government. The result of the conference was that the Duke of Terceira pro- mised to separate frjm the Cabralites. This act of the Queen had given great satisfaction to the public generally. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdCaptain Martin's squadron had sailed from Lisbon on a cruize. SPAIN \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Madtid journals of the 19th inst. announce that the Government was accelerating as much as possible the departure of one thousand men and forty Paixhans guns intended for Cuba. The Urden, which is considered the Ministerial organ, says\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\"We can fully confirm the impor- tant news that the English Government has ordered its naval forces to protect Cuba and it states that it also has made representations to the United States' Cabinet on the duty imposed on it of preventing piratical expeditions. The journals express the greatest s-itisfaetion at the proceeding of the British Government, and declare that the sentiment of indignation at the conduct of the American pirates is univerul in Spain. Private letters from Madrid speak of the general feeling of satisfaction produced there on all parties by the instruc- tions given by the British Government to the commander of the uaval force in the West Indies relative toco-operation with the Spaniards in the event of any newpiraiica) attempt on the island of Cuba. Even the Heraldo, which was not wont to say much in praise of Lord Palmerston, concludes a leading article on ihe subject III the following manner;- While giving expression to the grateful feeling these tidings have produced on us, we consider it our bounden dutylo dwell particularly 011 the beneficial results produced on this occasion, as on many others, from the Queen of England being represented in our country by a distinguish- ed nobleman who is intimately familiar with our national character, and who has on more than one occasion given proofs of his sincere desire to draw still closer the friendly relations existing between two nations which have so many interests in common. We feel convinced that the recom- mendations of Lord Howden have much contributed to inducing the British Cabinet to adopt on this question a policy so highly honourable. This being the C ire, we feel bound, as Spaniards, to pay to Lord Howden the tribute of gratitude aud ol thanks which he so well merits, and we consider his conduct ia the present iustance as an addi- tional title to the esteem with which he has so wet! inspired all classes of the people of this country.\" PRUSSIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAccording to advices from Berlinof the 22nd inst. the Italian Sovereigns are about to form a confederation similar to the Germanic League. The confedertion has a twofold object, namely, to maintain and strengthen inter- nal order by an equal and simultaneous advance of the Sov- ereign power in allltahan States and to render all foreign intervention, from whatever quarter, unnecessary. Such a confederation would free the Pope from the French Repub- licans, and the Emncror of Austria, therefore, finds it expe- dient to proceed with this measure in full concurrence with the other Italian rulers. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA correspondent of the New Prussian Gazette states that Prince Windischiiratz has been again appointed Governor of Bohemia.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdRuinourj had been circulated that the question about ,the incorporation of the Austrian dependencies with the German Bund had been made the subject of personal conference between the K'.ng of Prussia and the Emperor of Austria at Ischl, but this is decidedly contradicted. The inauguration of that stupendous woik the railway which connects St. Petersburg)) and Moscow took place on the ht inst, The Emperor o' Russia, accompanied by the Empress, the principal members of the Imperial family, several foreign Princes, and attended by the high Officers of State, and a numerous suite, quitted St. Petersburgh at six o'clock on Sunday, and arrived at Moscow at half past eight o'clock the same night. According to advices received from Milan of the 21.t inst., the Emperor of Austria made his solemn entry into that city on horseback, on that day, reviewed the troops in the Campo di Marte, proceeded to the Cathedr il where a Te Deum was performed, and rode immediately back to Monza, The deportment of the people is described as quiet and respectful.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe King of Hauover has honoured M. Von Manteufi'el with the grand cross of the Guelphic Order; and a list has been published of twenty-two veteran private soldiers in Prussia, who have received from Queen Vic- toria the medal commemorative of the campaigns from 1793 to 1814. Several tradesmen and artizans have been arrested in different parts of Hanover, charged with having been in communication with the political refugees in London. Letters, which were addressed to and received by parties in London, are in the hands of the Hanoverian police; and it is therefore supposed that some refugee must have fur- nished these documents.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA marriage was solemnised at Frankfort on Wednesday last, between Don Miguel de Brdganca and Adelaide Sophia Louisa Jane Leopoldina, Princess of Laewenstein-Wertheitn, only daughter of the late Hereditary Prince Constantine Joseph, and of the Prin- coss Mary Agnes Henrietta of Hohenloe Langenbourg.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd An English Company is at the present time occupied with the coiiftruction of a Railway between Christiana and the great Lake Mioscu, which will then open one hundred and forty English miles of the interior of Norway to commerce. Another Company is in negotiation for the establishment of a line of steamers between Hull and a Norwegian port. CENTRAL ASIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe German Constitutional Gazette con- tains the following article on the complications of which Central Asia is at this moment the theatre Twelve years ago the Persian army, directed by agents of Russia, was repulsed under the walls of Herat, & England undertook the fatal expedition to Cabul. led either by ambition, or by a desire to put an end to the Russian influence on the fron- tiers of India. Russia accepted the challenge, and marched an expedition against Khiva. The two rivals accordingly gave each other a rendezvous in the plains of Bactriana, lor, had the English succeeded in establishing themselves in Cabul, and the Russians in Khiva, the pulhs of the Baskirs aud Cossacks would have soon come to blows. But both expeditions failed, and when England had avenged the honour of her arms by a new expedition, and vigorously chastised the AffKhans, she definitively withdrew her armiea from the country to achieve more easy and useful conquests In Scinde and the Punjaub. Russia alone did not renounce her plans, and waited an opportunity to execute them. The first object of the cabinet of St. Petersburgh was to subject to her domination the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea, in order to obtain a point d'appui for future operations, and secure supplies, reinforcements, and a means ot retreat, in case of reverse. With that view, Russia erected forts on different points, and placed garrisons in them. She then opened negotiaitons with the Turkomans. The Kerghises readily consented to recognise the white Czar for their mas- ter. By similar manoeu ref, pursued with perseverance during several years, the Russian domination extended to Lake Aral, the Siedarja, aud the frontiers of Turkistan. Russia thus acquired a basis for mnre important undertak- ings, wheu a favourable opportunity should offer itself. Now the moment has arri- ed, ail I she is preparing to profit by it. Tsie death of the Khan of Herat gave the signal 01 a war of succession, in which Persin h is engaged, ond will, in all probibiliiy, as she did in IS3. invoke IIIIC\" more the assistance <' liu-sia. In the meantime the Kurai.in?, under the pretext of an incursion of the Turkomans, landed a body of troops on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, which is now marching towards Herat. General Perowski, who, notwithstanding the fatal result of the expedition to Khiva, is considered 8S one of the ablest generals of Russia, has resumed the chief command of the Russian forces in the Government of Orenburg. Should he march alone, or in conjunction with a Persian army towards Herat, it will be easy for him, if provided with a sufficient artillery, to reduce that fortress, where he will not meet this time a Pottinger. Will England remain an impassive spectator of events which threaten to shake, at no distant period, her empire in India? We do not believe it, and we are conviuced that ere long we sh<ll hear of measures adopted by the British Government.\" AMERICA,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLIVERPOOL, SUNDAY MORNING.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBy the arrival in the Mersey of the Royal mail steam-ship America, Shannon commander, we have received advices and letters from New Yoik to the 16th ingtij Boston to the 17th, and Halifax to the 19th. She brings 100.000 dollars in specie, and upwards of 50 passengers The New York papers st8te that the steam-ship Atlantic took out instructions from the President to Mr. Barringer. the United States Consul at Madrid, to urge upon the Spanish Government mercy and leniency towards her unfortunate and misguided prisoners. Intense excitement prevailed at Baltimore and throughout Pennsylvania in consequence of the negro outrage at Chris- tiana (reported by last steamer), by which Mr. Edward Gorsuch, the owner of the two fugitives whom he attempted to recover, was killed, and his son mortally wounded; the son was not dead at last accounts, but he was not expected to survive many hours. Several arrests of both whites and negroes supposed to be concerned in the outrage, had been made, and an armed force had been sent to Christiana to prevent any further outbreak. The Government has offered a reward of 4,000 dollars for the arrest and convic- tion of the offenders. Great preparations were making at Boston for the rail- road jubilee, at which the President and most of the high officials are expected to be present. The steamer Pampero, the vessel which conveyed the Cuban invaders to Havannah, had been given up to the American authorities by Mr. Sigur, at New Orleans. Eighteen men were arrested at New Orleans charged with riololls conduct and inciting a mob to tear down the True Delta newspaper office. Captaiu Kelly, one of the liberated Cuban prisoners, had arrived at New Orleans. His state- ments totally exonerate Lopez from the charge of having abandoned Colonel Crittenden and his party. From Canada we have no news of interest. The cropi are reported to be looking remarkably well, especially the wheat crop. From Ilavannah we have telegraphic accounts, by way of Savannah, to the 7tb September, one day later, which state that 160 prisoners had sailed for Spain in a Government transport, and that only four had been liberated, viz., Col. Haynes, Captain Kelly, Lieuteuaut Van Vechteo, and Mr. Chapman. The report contained in a telegraphic despatch from New Orleans, dated the 11th September, to the effect that a de- falcation of 50,000 dollars had been d:scovered in the house of J. C. Burnham and Co., of Havaunah, turns out to be much exaggerated. The defalcation will not extend to be- yond 15,000 dollars. Advices from St. Domingo to the 4th September had been received at New York by the arrival of the schooner Gray Eaale from Port-au-Platt, which stite that preparations were made by the Haytian and Dominican governments to renew warlike operations, and that the Haytian fleet had reached Cape Hayti previous to the sailing of the Gray Eagle. Port-an-Piatt was, on the 17th August, visited by a very severe hurricane, which tore up large trees from the roots and destroyed from fifteen to twenty houses. The chipping in the harbour also suffered severely. The English Brazil packet was driven on shore and totatlylost; a seaman be- longing to her was also drowned the schooner Sea was also driven on shore and lost; and the Norwegian brig Frarer, and schooner Chevere, had to cut away their masts to avoid the same fate. Every vessel in the harbour met with moie or less damage, excepting the Gray Eagle. Advices from Santa F\u00c3\u00a9. New Mexico, to the 29th of July, have been received, which report that the Navijo Indians had killed II persons and wounded eight others, but the cause is not stated.

{"ocr": "4h VISITATION OF THE DIOCESE OF PETERBOROUGH.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The Bishop of Peterborough commenced the triennial visitation of his diocese at Peterborough on Thursday week. In the course of his charge his Lordship made the following observations on the subject of baptismal regene- ration :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe term regeneration had, since the reformation, been used to express a change of mind in those who had hitherto lived in a state ot indifference about religion, or in open sin, to a sense of the necessity of sanctification f tlie soul, a life of holiness, an earnest desire to walk with God. He was not surprised, therefore, at persons minds being ,startled. when told that all this was given to the child in baptism. It was contrary to Scripture and the teaching of our own Church. The Church did, indeed, declare that infants were regenerated, and gave thanks; but it was clear that the Church did not use the term re- generate in the sense referred to, for she directed us to pray that infants, after admission by baptism into Christ's Church, miglu lead the rest of their lives according to this beginning, and finally be made inheritors ot Christ's ever- lasting kingdom. They knew that those who were dedi- cated to Christ were to be the servants of God, and they could not doubt but that strength would be giver, to them according to their need. On the subject of the burial ser. vice his Lordship said lie had received many applica- tions touching the reading of the burial service over the bodies of those who did not appear to be proper subjects for the rites of the Church. Ile could only say that he had no power to give any directions differing from those in the rubric. If the deceased did not come under the directions that were laid down, the minister was bound by the rule of obedience to the law. While saying this he did not despise or make light of the conscientious scruples pf those who felt strongly on the subject. He knew many instances in which the minds of ministers had been deeply pained; but how much graver the case would become had sue.i ministers been required to express their own judg- p.enJ mstead of acting in obedience to the law of their t.nurcn. It private judgment, in such a matter were to be legalised, doubts would arise in far more cases than were now contemplated. What minister would be found to decide those doubts, or indeed what bishop, if the case were refeired to him? An established religion, like a State, must have its written laws, and obediencs must follow. He could not but honour the conscientious scru- ples of the Christian minister but the real cause of sorrow to such a man would be that one of his flock had departed this life in such a state as to oblige his minister to express with faltering tongue the hope of his resurrection to eter- nal life. He (the Bishop) doubted whether any council of divines summoned to consider the subject would be pre- pared to frame provisions which should exclude any de- I parted soul at last from hope. TIlE BISHOP OF ST. ASAPII AND THE COMMUNION SERVICE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Chester Courant gives the following account of which the Holy Communion was recently administered by the Bishop of Saint Asaph at the consecration of the new Church at Gwersyllt:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdSo soon as the rails were full, the bread was delivered to each communicant successively by the Bishop in solemn silence, and when all had received he repeated once only to those ten or twelve persons, in- stead of separately to each, the words, The body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee,\" &c. The Vicar of Gresford then followed with the cup-(no word being uttered by him)\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand after all then kneeling had partaken of the wine the Bishop once for all prouounced the injunction, \"The blood of our Lord Jesus Christ which was shed for thee,\" &c. The Bishop did not ven- ture to substitute the plural for the singular number, after the fashion of some other innovators on rubrical propriety; but the inconsistency, not to say absurdity, of exhorting the communicants to take,\" to \"eat,\" to \"drink,\" after they had partaken of the elements was paiiifully evident. .L P_l1. DECLARATION ON THE bUFREMACY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdmn IUIIUWINB has been extensively circulated for signature A Decla- ration of the undersigned Clergy of the Church of England, in support of the Royal Supremacy in things ecclesiastical, and ot the wisdom and authority of the judgment ema- nating from its recent exercise. We, the undersigned Clergy of the Church of England, viewing with surprise and concern the attempts made by parties holding office in the Church to invalidate and nullify the judgment recently de- livered by the Sovereign as supreme governor of this realm, as well in all spiritual or ecclesiastical things or causes as temporal,\" by the advice of the Privy Council and the Primates of the Church; in the case ef Gorham v. the Bishop of Exeter, hereby testify our thankfulness for the judgment so delivered and feel ourselves called upon, under present circumstances (whether holding or not the view which called forth the judgment), humbly to state our conviction that it was a wise and just sentence, in accord- ance with the principles of the Church of England. And we respectfully, but firmly, protest against any attempt, from whatever quarter it n.ay proceed, to bring into con- tempt a judgment so issued and to charge with false teaching, and to discredit with their flocks, those whose doctrine has been pronounced by that judgment to be \"not contrary or repugnant to the declared doctrine of the Church of England.\" Such attempts we hold to be equi. valent to the enforcement of a standard of doctrine in our Church, by unauthorised individuals, opposed to that es- tablished by its supreme aurhority and, consequently, to be irreconcilable with the first principles of all Church polity, and necessarily to lead to a state of disorder, strife, and confusion in the Church. The document is said to have received upwards of 2,000 signatures. Among them are the Archdeacons of Saint David's, and C. Phillips, Canon of Saint David's. THE SCHISM IN THE WESLEYAN BODy.-The returns made to the meeting of the Wesleyan Conference show a diminution of nearly GO,000 in the numbers of the Wes- leyan body. A deputation from the Committee of dele- gates of the Dissentient Body addressed a letter to the Conference, seeking for a conference with a deputation from the main body, with a view to agree upon and set- tle such a code of laws as shall tend to promote the peace and prosperity of the Connexion.\" This was, on the part of the Conference, declined in the following terms:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" We are directed to state that the Conference is solemnly con- vinced that the peace and prosperity of the societies under its care will be most effectually promoted by a firm ad- herence to the principles avowed in its letter to Messrs. Stanley and Massingham, of the 3rd of August, 1850. Those principles, while they secure a willing reception and respectful consideration for all communications which may be addressed to the Conference, in accordance with its established laws and usages, effectually preclude it from recognising, or entering into any formal communication with, a self-constituted body, the existence of which in- volves a deliberate and flagrant violation of the discipline of Methodism, and the effect of whose operations has been very seriously detrimental to Christian order, edification, and charity.\" The Conference has on appeal confirmed a censure and suspension from the office of Superintt-ndent Pronounced against Dr Beaumont by thfr-London District Meeting, on the ground of his not ha=yjjfe- executed the discipline of the Connexion\" against of the dissen- tient party with thj vigour which IBL been generally adopted against them.

The estimated cost is 1:40,006. It will afford ac- commodation to upwards of 2,000 persous. PAUPERISM AND IRREMGION.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIn a document ad- dressed bv the Poor law Central Board to the Guardians of the Sheffield Union, urging npon them the adoption of inmediate measures for the religious instruction and su- perinteW^lence of their paupers, it is stated that out of 1,905 infixes of the workhouse, no less than 1,407 have declined to edge themselves of any religious per- suasion, and 18 have openly avowed that they are ofnone. WHOLESALE PISOSKLYTISM. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd It is alleged that in B. slau one single priest has, during the last three years, ffi\u00c3\u00a1Je no fewer than 720 converts from Protestantism\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd120 on t\" ir death-beds, and 600 young people ot the different sc lio' !s.

POPISH MIRACI.ES.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdI\u00c2\u00bbEKI.IN, JULY 27.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Je- ;uit missions are making extraordinary progress in Baden. Forty-two persons in one day announced their conversion to the Roman Catholic faith in Etlingon In the course of the next week, three priests of a Je- suitical order will preach in Heidelberg and Manheim. and may probably extend theirpioselytising labours to the free city of Frankport. Their progress is not want- ing in miracles. The last achieved by priestly cunning and popular ignorance was wrought in the neighbour- hood of Luxemburg. A young peasant woman prayed the advice of her father confessor on a subject of great montiil disquietude. She asserted that her departed grandmother was in the habit of appearing to her be- cause the stipulated number of masses has not been read in her behalf afrer death. The case was referred to ahigher eccesiastic.t) authority by the village priest and a solemn mass ordained for a certain day. The sacred ceremony took place, the young woman kneel ing in front of the alter in fervent prayer, when, ac- cording to her account, the figure of her grandmother appeared behind the priest marched straight towards her, and with a sort of grateful motion laid one hand upon her prayer-book. She fainted, and on her recovery found on the of her prayer book the impression of a hand burned deeply into the pasteLoard. No one else saw the departed grandmother; but the miracle was believed, and the young woman, her prayer book, and the priest, have become objects of veneration among the surrounding neighbourhood. THE USE OF AN Ecr,IPSE.-In Bavaria, the priests have frightened the people into considerable alinsgiv- ing by telling them the eclipse might be the be- ginning of the end of all things. At the entrance of the Church of the Minories, in Vienna, the following \"Cluistain Invitation\" was posted: The 27th July0, being the eve of a great phenomenon of nature, pro- cessions will be made by the faithful to the shrines of our Lady at Maria Ilell and Klein Maria Teferl, to pray for the intercession of the Queen of Heaven, that no harm may happen to our beloved city of Vienna. The faithful assemble at the convent of the Carmelites at six in the morning, and are requested to bring with 1 9 them female children clothed in white, to attend the cross. ENORMOUS TELESCOPE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn Wednesday an enor- mous telescope arrived in Hyde Park, the property, it is stated, of the Hev. John Craig, Vicar of Leamington Priors, who has obtained the permission of Lord Sey- mour to place it there for a short time for the purpose of adjustment. The barrel of the telescope is about SO feet in length, and is composed of sheet iron the diameter in the centre is about four feet, at the upper extremity about two feet, and at the lower extremity about twelve inches. FACTORY LABOUR IN THE UNITED STATE, There is a general impression in this country that the workpeople in the cotton factories of the United States are much better paid than those in this country; and the advocates of a highly protective tariff allege that, owing to the amount of wages which they pay, they cannot compete with manufacturers employing the pauper labour\" ot England. How far these allega- tion are true, or otherwise we my learn from the fol- lowing extract of a letter from Paterson, in the state of New Jersey, which appears in the New York Tribune of the 11th instant:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\"Paterson, Wednesday, July 9, 1851.\" 41 Monday last being the day for the Ten-hour Law to come into operation, the cotton factories have all i educed the waNcs-usually from one-half to an entire day's pay in the week. This is really hard, as the poor operatives were barely able to make a living before the reduction took place. The hands in conse- quence all struck work. To-day (Wednesday) I ob- serve, however, that a good number have returned to their works in several of the mills, the employers com- promising the matter with them. In our present cir- cumstances it is difficult to look this question fairly in the face. In many of the mills the machinery is of a very imperfect kind add to which it is so much worn, and the capital invested so small, that there is less chance of competing with the eastern manufacturers than they have with the European market. On the other hand, the pay is at present starvation point- usually If. 50c. to 2f. 50c. per work for woman and boys.\" From one dollar and fifty cents is in English money, from six shillings and threepence to ten shil- lings and fivepence per week, being decidedly lower than she average earnings of women and boys in the spining and weaving factories in this neighbour- hood. And it must be recollected, too, that boys are not employed at so early an age in America as in Eng- land none, we believe, being allowed to work under fifteen years of age.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdManchester Guardian. THE SPREAD OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe Athenceum has an interesting article on this subject, in which it points out the probability that formerly exis- ted of the Dutch language attaining a kind of universa- lity-I In 1650 the United Provinces seemed more likely to make a grand figuie in the future world's his- tory than England. Their wealth, activity, and mari- time power were the most imposing in Europe. They had all the carrying trade of the west in their hands. Their language was spoken in every port when that of England was then hardly known abroad. Yet Holland has fallen nearly as much as the Saxon has risen in the scale of nations. Her idiom is now ac- quired by a few. Her merchants conduct their corres- pondence and transact their business in French or in English. Even her writers have many of them clothed their genius in a foreign garb. Dutch, like Welsh, Flemish, Erse, Basque, and other idioms, is doomed to perish as an intellectual medium; but the tongue of Shakespeare and of Bacon is now too firmly rooted ever to be torn away. The English language is gradually taking possession of all the ports and coasts of the world\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdmaking itself the channel of every communica- tion.

CLEVER TRICK.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdCaptain Swinney applied at Marl- borough-street, on Friday week tor advice in the fol. lowing dilemma:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdHe was walking down Regent- street, when his attention was casually attracted to a nne showy horse which a man was leading. At that instant an honestlooking fellow, dressed like a gentle- man's coachman, came up to him and said. \"Ah Sir, I see you are looking at that horse it's just the horse I want for master. One of our horses is dead and that horse just matches the one left. Now, I bought that horse for \u00c2\u00a3 50., but when I wanted to pay for it the rascally dealer said it was guineas, not pounds and so we've had a wrangle, and he won't le me have the animal at no price. Do pray, Sir, try and get it for my master, and here's the money.\" The coach- man showed a bag of sovereigns, and applicant, feeling much concern for the distress of the coachman and his honest anxiety to look after his master's interest and wishes, consented to do what he could to serve him. He offered the jE53 10s. to the nephew of the dealer, who came up at that moment, but when he proposed to close the bargain by tendering the coach- man's money the nephew refused to take it, assigning as a reason that his uncle had made a vow not to take the coachman's money on account of the row that had taken place, and he would not make his uncle break it. Applicant, who continued in his good-natured disposi- tion towards the coachman, got over this difficulsy by stepping into Hopkinson's, the banker's, in Waterloo- place, and writing a cheque for \u00c2\u00a3 53., which he handed over to the nephew. The horse was to be placed in a stable in Regent-street, and while room was making tor the animal by the removal of a carriage which stood in the gateway, the honest coachman disappeared with his bag of money, and applicant found himself, to his chargin, the undoubted owner of the horse. Feeling some misgiving that he had been taken in, and had Paid, \u00c2\u00a3 52., for a horse not worth as many shillings, lie thought his best course was to seek Magisterial asaist- ance.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMr. Hard wick expressed his surprise thatCapt. Swinney should have been imposed upon by so com- mon a trick. The Captain having been recommended to ascertain the value of the horse before he gave the parties into custody for fraud, left the Court tor that purpose, and shortly afterwards returning with an evi- dent addition to his inquietude, stated that he had the horse valued, when it was pronounced to be worth not less than SO guineas. He now feared he had bought stolen property, as it was difficult to believe the biter had bid in this transaction. Mr. Haidwick recom- mended Captain Swinney to refer the matter to the police. STEAM-BOAT ACCIDENT AT SEA. lhc Pacific, one of the translantic steamers, met with an accident at sea which at the time created the greatest alarm. \"About half-past 1 a.m. an unusual vibrating motion was felt in the ship, and which was almost im- mediately followed by the breaking of that part of one of the engines (the port engine) called the crosstail,' which sevcn.l in the centre; and, at the same time, its connecting rod snapped off about two feet from the end. The starboard engine made some three or four revolutions after the accident, and wielded the broken rod, so that it came in contract with a beam supporting two pillars and broke the feed pipe, and in a moment the whole ot the engine department was tilled with boiling hot steam, the density of which was such as to render it impossible to discover what, damage had been done for some time. 'Ihe engineers (Messrs. Parkis and Harris) at once unhooked the engines, closed the stopcocks of the boilers, and raised the safety vales, thus at once overcoming danger. The engineers, in spite of the scalding steam, succcded in stopping the starboard engine. The firemen, too, alive to the probable danger, and energetic to prevent it, auhough compelled, in detachments, fainting and al- most overcome, to grope their way on deck to breathe the air, immediately on temporarily recovering hastened down again to aid if possible in the leparation, and, in a space of time inconceivable, suceeded in raking out all the immenste fires (32). and thus all was safe. Soon after this the steam cleared off, and no dam\" o to life aj- limb occurred. ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION BY A LADY. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd On Saturday week a young lady in Paris, who had expres- sed strong opposition to the intention of her mother to contract a second marriage, went to the house of the destined husband, and on his signifying his deterniina t;1) to presvere in thtfaffair, ihe pulled forth a pisto! ^id discharged it at him, when the shot grazed his >ioulder, and lodged in the wall.

{"ocr": "YR AWYRGYLCH. NID oes odid neb nad ydynt yn eithaf adnahyddns o bwysigrwydd a defnyddioldeb yr Awyrgylch. Yr cedd hyn yn eitbaf adnabyddus i'r hynafiaid ymres- yment ei fod yn un o'r pedair el fen o ba rai y tarddai pob peth; a rhoddai ereill iddo fath o addoliad, ac ystyrient ef fcI y prif dduwdod. Ganfodyroesoedd ofergoelus hyny wedi myned drosodd, a'u hofergoel- ion gyda hwy, ni fydd o nemawr adeiladaeth i wneu- thur sylw. pellach o honynt dan y testun hwn ond dylem lawenhau am y goleuni nerthol ac addysgiadol mae y celfyddydau yn lewyrchu i ddirgelion natur. Mor bell mae ymchwil dyn wedi cyrhaedd, fel nad oes dim braidd o fewn ei gyrhaedd nad ydyw wedi ei oIrhain-pob gwrthddrych byw a difywyd, y dolydd a'r coedwigoedd, y moroedd a'r mynyddoedd, ydynt yn awr dan lywodraeth ei wybodaeth; fel hyn mae gwybodaeth helaeth yn bresennol yn bod mewn per- thynas i'r hyn sydd wedi bod dan sylw dyn o amser Galileo hyd y dydd heddyw, sef yr awyr. Desgrifir yr awyr yn gyffredinol fel gwlybwr, o her- wydd y symuda sylweddau drwyddoheb rwystr. Gellir gweled hyn yn eglur yn ehediad adar a man bryfed ynddo pan yn llonydd; gall y milyn lleiaf hyd y mwyaf o ehediaid yr awyr symud drwyddo heb y rhwvstr lleiaf; a throsglw.vddir y sain a'r arogl mwyaf tyner gyda rhwyddineb drwyddo, pan mewn ystad o lonyddwch. Amgylchynir yr hoil ddaear ganddo, ac lieb ei bresennoldeb, ni fyddai y gwrthddrych dystadlaf yn nhrefn natur yn abl i gynnorthwyo ei hunan; mae mor anghenrheidiol i blanigion ag i ddyn, i drigolion y dyfnderoedd ag i'w drigolion ei hun, fel nad oes yn nhrefn natur un gwrthddrych nad ydyw yr awyr, i ryw raddau, yn dvianwadn arno, ac yn gweini iddo. Fe brofa cyniiefmdra cylfredinol nad yw yr awyr yn wag\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdei fod yn fater neu sylwedd, galiuog i weini gwrthwynebiad cryf i rym llaw gelfyddydol. Y pwys- au ar fanerau a ddygir yn ei erbyn, ar edyn a hwyliau melinau gwynt, ar longau yn eu llawn hwyliau, chwythiad megin, &c., ydynt yn brofion eglur a diym- wad o'i sylweddolrwydd. Prawf arall o'i sylweddol- rwydd yw ei alluogrwydd i gynnyrchu a throsglwyddo sain. Yn ngollyngiad neu dyrfiad pylor, newidir y sylwedd hwmv i swm o gas o wrthneidiolrwydd aruthr- ol, yr hwn ar yr enyd a gyfyngwyd o fewn y cylch a feddiannwyd yn flaenorol gan y pylor; tyr allan gyda grym rhyfeddoJ, ac a dery yr awyr allanol efo grym- usder. 0 herwydd fod tan yn arferedig, gellir medd- wl fod mwy nag awyr yn gweithredu. Rhyw brawf uach a esyd hyn ya eghir: llanwer chwysigen yn Hawn o awyr, a gwasger hi nes y tyr; neu y ffordd oreu fyddai rhoddi dyrnod iddi nes y torai, yna fe ruthrai yr awyr allan gyda grymusder, gan daraw yn erbyn yr awyr cylchynol, nes cvnnyrchu trwst mor uchel ag ergydiad llaw-ddryll. Y ffaith hon yn unig a brawf sylweddolrwydd yr awyr. Pe tarewid y chwysigen gyda nerth bychan, annigonol i'w thori, ni chynnyrchai ond ycbydig o scvn gan hyny, yr awyr cyfyngedig o fewn y chwysigen, wrth ruthro allan yn erbyn yr awyr allanol, sydd yn pery y twrf. Pe symudid yr awyr cylchynol, ni chynnyrchid swn. Er prawf o hyn, cymmerer cloch gytfredin, a gosoder hi o fewn llestr wedi ei waghau o'r awyr a sugnedydd, tarawer hi yn galed, ac ni chlywir dim oddiwrthi. Deallir wrth hyn mor wir anghenrheidiol yw awyr i gynnyrchu stirn; ond gan mai rhan arall, neu garden arall o anianyddiaeth naturiol ydyw, gadawaf iddo y tro yma. Gallwn sylwi fod y chwysigen yn alluog i ddyoddef cydwasgiad mawr, hyny yw, gwasgiad cvdfFurf, fel y byddo pob rhan o honi yn derbyn yrun pwysau o bob tu oil drosti; fel hyn gellir cyfyngu yr awyr i gylch llai. Y casgliad o hyn yw, fod yn rhaid fod grouyn- au cyfansoddol yr awyr yn cael eu dwyn yn nes at eu gilydd; a chan yr eanga y chwysigen yn union pan ryddheir y cydwasgiad, dengys hyn adferiad yr awyr, neu ei ronynau, i'w pellder biaenorol. Yn ol y prawf hwn, gellir gwneuthur unrhyw swm o awyr feddiannu ychwaneg neu lai o gyfwng hyny yw, gellir ei eangu neu ei gyfyngu ac os cyfyngir ef, dychwela i'w faint- ioli yr un fath a gwthiedydd (spring). Y gwrthneid- iolrwydd o'r awyr a gynnyrchir gan rym gwrthyredig- 01 (repulsive) gwres (caloric), yr hwn a duedda i wa- hanu gronynau yr awyr hyd nes y gwrthweithir ef gan rym gwrthwynebol. 0 Y mae gwrthneidiolrwydd yr awyr yn cynnwys nerth anghyffredin pan y cyfyngir ef i le bychan mae ei ymdrech i adferu ei briodol faint, yn gryf dros ben mae mor fawr weithiau, nes y tyr beiriannau cryfion o haiarn yn cliwilfriw, a gesyd y manau o'i gwmpas mewn cyrnmaint perygl a gollyngiad pylor. Ar yregwyddor hon y gwneir awyr-ynau (air guns), y rhai a yrant belenau o blwin amryw gannoedd o lath- eni gyda'r tin nerth a phylor. Nid yw awyr-ynau. neu yregwyddor ar ba un y gweithredant, ddiin mwy na llai nag awyr wedi ei gydwasgu o fewn cyleh bych- an mewn pellen gron wrth ollwng ychydig o hwn yn rhydd, mae ei ymdrech mor fawr i ennill ei briodol faint, fel y gyr y fwleden allan o'i fiaen, am nad yw hon yn cynnyg cvmniaint o rwystr iddo ag ochrau y gwn, ac fel hyn mae y fwleden yn ehedeg drwy y faril, yn cael ei gwihio yn mlaen gyda nerth mor fawr gan yr awyr, fel y gyrir hi amryw gannoedd o latheni, ac y treiddia i goed a gwrthddrychau ereill o gjfartal galedwch. Mae yr Iioll ystyriaethau hyn yn prof, fod awyr yn sylwedd, ac o ganlyniad, mae y gory ni ad yn dyfod \"yn union, A yw awyr yn tebygu sylweddau ereill yn y rhinwedd cyffredinol hwnw, sef pwysau ? Gellir ateb y gofyniad hwn yn union mewn dwy tfordd. Os yw awyr yn meddu pwysau, rhaid fod llestr yn cynnwvs awyr yn pwyso inwy ria Hestr gwagobono; felly y mae pellen o wydr yn llawer ysgafnach pan yn wag o awyr na phan yn llawn. Fel hyn mae yr awyr, fel sylwedd arall, yn meddn pwysau, ac mae y fraitii yn arwain i ystyriaethau mawrion. Nid yw y fFaith wedi ei phenderfvtiu pa mor uchel y cyrhaedda yr awyr; ond gellir casglu oddiwrth be!- ydrau yr haul, y rhai a dcflir yn y cyfnos yn mhell wedi i'r gwasanaethydd anmlirisiadwy hwnw fyned yn is oa/r terfyngylch, fod awyrgylch y ddaear yn cyr- haedd o ddeugain i bump a deugain o filltiroedd yn unionsyth i fyny oddiar wyneb y ddaear. Mae yr oerni a theneuder yr awyr mor eithafol yn yr uchder yma, fel mae yn rhwystro estyniad peilach o hono yn ol gwybodaeth celfyddyd. Wrth fod yr awyr yn cyrhaedd mor uchel, rhaid o anghenrheidrwydd fod y rhan hono o'r awyr ag sydd mewn cyssylltiad a gwyneb y ddaear, nen y rhanhono ag sydd yn nesaf i wyneb y ddaear, yn dwyn ychwan- eg o bwysau, o herwydd fod yn rhaid iddo ddwyn yr holl bwysau uwchben, Yn union ar yr un egwyddor a phe gosodech lwythi o wair, y naill lwyth arben y llall, i wneuthur das pe torech y das, celech weled fod y rhan isaf yn llawer ealetaeh--y gwair wedi ei wasgu yn nes at ei gilydd, nag yn y rhan uchaf. Felly efo yr awyr, pa nesaf y hyddo at y ddaear, trymaf i gyd ydyw, a pha uchaf i fyny y bydd, ysgafnaf i gyd ydyw, gan fod gronynau yr awyr yn nes at en gilydd yn agos i'r ddaear. Gwyddai yr hynafiaid fod yrawyr yn dwyn pwysau ar y ddaear; ond ni wawriodd y goleuni hwnw hyd ainser Galileo, eifod yn abl i gyn- nal colofn o arian byw o ddeg modfedd ar hugain. Os cymmerir pibell wydr wedi ei chau yn un pen, ac yn agored yn y pen arall, a rhoddi ynddi arian byw, a tharo eich bys ar y pen agored, a'i wyneb yn isaf, a'i roddi mewn llestr yn cynnwys arian byw, fe saif yr arian byw mewn uchder o ddeg modfedd ar hugain yr achos o hyn yw, na fedr yr arian byw ddisgyn dim yn y bibell heb godi yr arian byw yn y llestr, yr hwn sydd eisoes yn cael ei gylchynu gan yr awyr allanol. Yr un fath gyda dwfr gall yr awyr gynnal colofn o ddwfr o bedair troedfedd ar ddegar hugain, am ei fod yn ysgafnach dair gwaith nag arian byw. Ar y ffeithiau hyn y gwneir y barometer, yr hwn nid yw ond pibell wydr yn eynnwys arian byw, a'r hwn a ddengys oddiwrth ei godiad a'i ddisgyniad fod yr awyr yn pwyso mwy neu lai. Pan yn gydwastad a'r mor, mae colofn yr awyr yn hwy yn y bibell, na phan yn uwch na hyny felly pan yn gydwastad a'r mor, gwthir yr arian byw yn uchel i'r bibell, a phan yn uwch na'r mor, fe ostynga, am fod yr awyr yn llai cwmpasog i fyny yn uchel nag i Iawr. Pan ddidolir y dwfr a tyddo yn gymmysgedig a'r awyr, mewn ffurf o wlaw, bydd y pwysau yn llai, ac o ganlyniad fe os- tynga yr arian byw yn y bibell; ac oddiwrth y weith- red hon y tardda y dull o ddweyd fed y glasses yn isel,\" ac i'r gwrthwyneb, pan fyddo yr hin yndcg a I llonydd, fod y \"glasses yn uchel,\" Mae math arall o farorneler, gwahanol i'r un cyffredin, yr hwn a arfei-ir gan fordwywyr; mae hwnw wedi cyfyngu y bibell am ychydig ffordd, fel na fyddo i bob ysgogiad o'r llong achosi codiad neu ostyngiad yn yr arian byw. Mae pwysau yr awyr yn agos i wyneh y ddaear braidd yn anghredadwy; ond mae profion mor ddi- ammheuol wedi eu gwneuthur, ac yn hawdd i'w gwneutlnir, fel nad all un dyn o fesur neillduol o syn- wyr wadu neu fethu eu synied. Y pwysau a gyfrifir yn gyffredin o awyr ar fodfedd ysgwar ydyw, o bed- war ar ddeg i bumtheg pwys; felly rhaid i gorff dynol o faintioli cyffredin gynnal o 15 i 20 tunell o bwysau, ond fod y pwysau hwn wedi ei gyfartalu dros yr boll gorff, fel nad ydym yn teimlo un rhwystr nac anghyf- leusdra oddiwrtho. Mae yr awyr yn wlybwr anghyfnewidiadwy. Mae achos i feddwl, oni bai y gweithrediadau y mae yn ddarostyngedig iddynt yn feunyddiol, na oddefai byth ddim cyfnewidiad; o achos y gweithrediadau hyn, mae yn ddarostyngedig i gyfnewidiadau mawr, ac y mae y rhai hyn yn cymmeryd lie bob awr a phob mynyd. Gwvddom fod ystafell gauedig, yn Hawn o bob], yn tueadu i lygru yr awyr, \u00c3\ufffde, hyd y nod yn ei gyfnewid i'r fath raddau nes y byddo yn difa bvwyd gyda chyflymdra y gwenwyn mwyaf dinystriol. Oddi- wrth hyn, gwelir y pwysfawrogrwydd o wyntyllio tai, lleoedd o gydgasgliad pobloedd, megys capeli, eg- lwysi, &c., yn lie fel y mae capeli Cymru yn gyffredin, y ffenestri yn nghau, nes y byddo gwres, chwys, ac anadl y rhai presennol, yn annyoddefol braidd, a hyn i gyd o herwydd ystyfnigrwydd ac anwybodaeth. !Bydd rhai yn ewyno rhag cael annwyd, ereill ei fod yn codi y peswch, wrth agor ffenestri y capel, a rhyw res an- orphen o esgusodion, yn dangos anwybodaeth ac hun- anoldeb y creaduriaid hyn. Pegwyddent yr egwydd- or ar ba un y maent yn byw, byddai y ffenestri yn agored ar ddechreu y cyfarfod, ac felly hyd ei ddiw- edd, ac ni fyddai dim perygl amgen nag oeri ambell gopa digon poeth. Yr achos yn gyffredin mewn lie- oedd o addoliad na oleuai y canwyllau yn dda, yw fod yr awyr yn llygredig, ac o ganlyniad yn afiachus. Nid yw yn rhyfedd fod oymmaint o hepian a thrym- gysgn yn y capeli, pan y gadewir jddynt fod yn debyc- ach i dai pobi nag i le addas i addoli, a hyny o achos anwybodaeth. Nid oes fawr ogost yn dilyn gollyng- itd awyr ffres i mewn, na gollyngiad yr un afiaehus allan. Mae hvn a hyn o danwydd yn cael eu llosgi yn y corft' dynol yn barhaus, at gynnal cyfartalrwydd y gwres drwy y corff, ac etfaith y llosgiad hwn yw llygr- iad cylchynol yr awyr, ac nid nnnhebyg; i hyn yw eff- aith tanan cy-ffredinol ar yr awyr. Gallem yn hylaw ddangos effaith y llosgiad hwn, drwy osod canwyll dan lestr cauedig mewn dwfr wedi ei goleuo, a cheir gweled, wrth i'r ganwyll losgi yn yr un awyr heb gyf- newidiad, y coda y dwfr i fyny, yr hyn a ddengys gyf- newidiad llygredig yr awyr drwy leihau ei swm. Oddiwtthyprawf hwn, gellir gweled dau beth: yn gyntaf, na oddefai yr awyr yn y llestr i'r ganwyll oleuo yn ln'Vy na hyn a hyn o amser ac yn ail, yn niwedd y prawf, fod llai o awyr vn y llestr na chyn hyny. Mae llawer o ddulliau heblaw llosgi canwyll a leiha yr awyr mewn lie cyfyng. Gwlvbwr wedi ei ddar- paru drwy ferwi ychydig o galch a brwmstan, sydd ganddo y rhinwedd i sugno rhan fawr o awyr a osodir i'w weithrediad. Mae yn ddigon hawdd gwneuthur y prawf hwn, drwy ysgwyd y gwlybwr mewn costrel, ac ar ol hyny tynu y corcyn allan odditan ddwfr, a rheda y dwfr i mewn i'r gostrel yn gyfartal i'r awyr a sugnir gan y cymmysg neu y gwlybwr a enwyd. Gall- wn wedi hyny chwilio a all yr awyr a erys yn y gos- trel gynnal fflam neu oleuni canwyll, neu ryw fath arall o oleuni, yr un fath ag a wnaed yn y prawf o'r blaen, a chawn weled yn union y gwna yn y gwrth- wyneb\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdyn hwn diffoddai y goleuni. Nid yn annhehyg, gyda golwg ar deneuder yr awyr a'i anmhnredd, mae capeli ac eglwysi anwyntylliedig \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 ond nid o herwydd anmhuredd yr awyr y mae cym- maint o gwyno gan drafaelwyr wrth esgyn penau mynyddoedd, ond yn unig o herwydd ei deneuder. Desgrifia rhai teithwyr eu dyoddefiadau, wrth ddringo Mont Blanc yn yr Eidal, fel pe bai eu holl gyfansodd- iad yn ymddattod; teimlent ryw ben-ysgafnder banner iiietidwol, amddifadrwydd o nerth, rhyw ddi- hoender a blinder, ynghyd a syrtbni, nes y byddai yn llawn ddigon o drafferth i'r arweinwyr eu cadw yn effro a phe buasai iddynt gysgu, mae yn ddiammau y buasai y cwsg hwnw yn gwsg tragywyddol; ac nid yn anaml y gwelir esgyrn dynol ar fynyddoedd uehel. Mae yr awyr mor denau ar rai aiaaau a gyrhaeddwyd I gan deithwyr ar fynyddoedd yr Andes, yn Amen .a Ddeheuol, fel mai prin y clywid un twrf wrth ollwng ergyd aHan o ddryll; ac yn ami iawn bydd esgyrn dyniou ac anifeiliaid a syrthiaaant yn ebyrth i'r awyr denau i'w cael yma a thraw ar y mynyddoedd hyn. Er fod awyr denau fel hyn yn achosi llawer o anhyf- rydwch teimlad am beth amser, etto, wrth fod yn hir dan yr un awyr, mae y rhanau mewnol yn cael adeg ac amser i lenwi eu hunain ag awyr o'r un pwysau a'r un oddiallan, ac yn dyfod yn y diwedd y naill awyr i wrthwynebu y llall, yrun fath ag mewn awyr dewach bydd yi awyroddimewn yngyfartal i'r awyr oddiallan, a bydd yr anghyfartalrwydd a achosai yr anhyfrydwch yn lleihau; ac felly gellir dywedyd am dymher awyr denau, ei fod yn dyfod yn raddol yn llawn mor hawdd cynnefino ynddo ag awyr o dymher uwch, os na fydd yn rhy oer i gynnal bywyd. Mae yn amlwg y gall dyn fyw yn bur nchel, mewn awyr denau, heb ddy- oddef llawer o anhwylusdod, a dwyn ei orchwylion yn mlaen heb fawr o rwystr. Gellir gwelett hyn yn ucheldiroedd Tartary, arororau China, lie mae y trig- olion yn byw mewn awyr bur denau hefyd yn Mex- ico^lle mae pob math o orchwylion yn cael eu dwyn yn mlaen gyda'r un hwylusdod ag yn Mhrydain. Yr un fath hefyd yn Quito. Mae Mexico 7.775 o droed- feddi yn uwch na'r mor, a Quito yn 9,550. Mae trig- olion rhai manau ar ochrau mynyddoedd yr Himalaya yn uwch fyth. Fel hyn, dangosir gymmaint sydd gan gynneftndra i wneuthnr ag esmwytho a lieihau yr an- hyfrydweh. Mae hefyd fwy na chynnefindra yn y lleoedd a enwyd yn tueddu i fsmwytho; hyny yw, fod yr hin yn llawer mwy sefydlog, tra y mae gwynt- oedd, gwres, a llawer o ddwfr yn cael ei ddal yn yr awyr yn Mhrydain. Mae y rhai hyn yn achosi llawer o anesmwythder i'n teimladau, trwy eu hymweiiadau sydyn, yn newid tymheredd yr awyr ac yn fuan ceir clywed cwyno fod \"yr bin yn drymllyd,\" a'n bod yn teimlo ein hunain yn ddioglyd, yn swrth, &c., pan, mewn gwirionedd, mai llawer ysgafnach fydd yr awyr nag o'r blaen, ond mai cyfnewidiad sydyn yn mantol pwysau yr awyr, heb gael atebiad gan awyr o'r un pwysau oddimewn, ydyw yr achos o'r camsyniad a'r anhyfrydweh hwn. Mae gan arian byw rinwedd i Jsugno awyr i ryw raddan, ond hydd yn rhaid ei roddi mewn llestr, a'i ferwi am hir amser; ac os cymmerir y gweddill 0 awyr a fyddo ar ol y prawf hwn, a cheisio goleuo can- wyll ynddo, ni fyddai yn fwy abl i gynnal fflam nag yn y prawf cyntaf a'r dwfr. Cyfnewidir yr arian hyw yn fawr\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdnid yw yn nibellach yn meddu ei wlybeidd- rwydd na'i ddyscleirdeb metelaidd, ond wedi ei droi yn sylwedd coch, cragenog ac y mac wedi ennill yn ei bwysau ragor nag ydoedd yn ei gyflwr gwlybyraidd a metelaidd. Wrth hyn, gwelwn, pan boethir arian byw mewn swm o awyr, collir rhan o'r awyr o'r llestr y poethir ef ynddo, ac ennillir arian byw mewn pwys- au; a'r casgliad yw, fod yr awyr colledig yn guddiedig yn yr arian byw, a'i bod yn bosibl dadguddio ac ad- ennill y rhan a gollwyd. Gwelir hyn oddiwrth y ffaith ganlynol. Os, wedi i'r awyr gael ei sugno gan Z, yr arian byw, y cyfedir y poethder hyd nes tanio, ad- fera yr arian yr holl awyr a sngnwyd, ac ail-ymddeng- ys yr arian byw yn ei ffurf briodol a metelaidd, a bydd yr awyr a adferwyd yn tebygu i awyr gyffredin, o ran bod yn wrthneidiol, yn loyw, yn ddiliw, ac yn ddiflas. Ar yr un pryd, mae hwn yn dra gwahanol i'r awyr a wrthododd yr arian byw ar y cyntaf ei sugno di- ffoddai hwnw ganwyll yn union, ond JIysg yn yr un a adferwyd gyda thanbeidrwydd. Mae yr awyr yn yr hwn y gommeddodd y ganwyll oleuo, mor niweidioi, fel y diffodda fywyd yn gystal a fflam. Mae'r ffaith hon wedi ei sefydlu yn anorchfygol, drwy soddi anifeiliaid bychain ynddo. Am ei ddinystr- olrwydd i fywyd, gelwir ef azote, oddiwrth dd\u00c3\u00a1u air Groeg, a asoe a, dim, zoe, bywyd. Yr awyr a ad- ferwyd o'r arian byw, yr hwn a gynnal losgiad, ac sydd ganddo weithiau yr effaith o drosglwyddo i syl- weddau llcsgiadol flas sur, ac oddiwrth yr amgylchiad hwn, gelwir ef oxygen gas, neu fel y tarddir ef o'r Groeg oddiwrth oxus, sur, gennas, cenedlwyf. Mae yr awyr yn gyfansoddedig o'r ddau gas hyn, yn ol y cyf- artalrwydd o 1-5 o oxygen, i 4-5 o azote.", "word": "3", "description": "\u2026.

These Pills will be found one of the best medicines ever offered to the Public: harmless and simple, yet thoroughly efficacious in removing Indigestion\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdknown by a sense of fullness and pain in the stomach after meals, ftatulenceL spasmodic affections of the chest, giddiness, inactivity, and langour. sense of fullness in the throat (popularly called the rising of the lights), loss of appetite, and sometimes great craving for food, sick. ness after meals, heartburn, drowsiness, sick-headache, sour belch ings, rumbling sensation in the stomach or bowels, restlessness n night, startling and frightful dreams, sometimes great moaning the sleep, and sense of weight and oppression upon the chest, un- pleasant taste in the mouth in the morning; the tcngue frequently covered with a yellowish fur, shooting pains from the stomach to the shoulder-blades, pain in the side, yellowness of the eyes and skin, weight over the eyes and back part of the hpad, loss of m*e mory, dizziness and dimness of sight, ringing noise in the cars, and great depression of spirits. They correct the morbid state of the liver and organs subservient to digestion, promote a due secretion of bile, speedily remove habitual costiveness, destroy worms, relieve the constitution of gouty matter and other impurities, and restora the frame to a healthy state, These Pills have been used by the Proprietor in private practice, for the last ten years, with extraordinary success. They are suit- able for the most delicate females, and are well known by hundreds who have derived from their use the greatest benefit. They do not require confinement; moderate exercise will promote their benefi- cial effects; seldom acting on the bowels until several hours after taking them, and then almost imperceptibly as a gentle aperient they will be found to answer admirably. Tanner's Pills are tonic and carminative, promoting a kindly warmth in the stomach and bowels, ana give tone and vigour to the whole system. In all cases it cannot be expected that one or two doses will effect a cure; they must be steadily persevered in. for several days, and then the most successful results will shovr themselves.

Its continuance is proved by all experience to b a temptation to idleness and crime, and our state of society is not so pure, that artificial inducements to pov-Tty and crime are re- quired. In the majority of farms land is encumbered with useless and injurious hedge rows and timber trees, whose removal uoul 1 both increase the area of useful ground, and allow the full beneift of the iri- fluencies of sun and air, Few tenants when their land is measured have an allowance for hedges or timber trees. The miserable drainage of a great part of the country is no'orious, yi t it is nearly as necessary to the fill] of is I)CI.f,ect is to the health ot the animal creation. The custom ot playing at so! lie is for a week or so every year, is a serious interference to a farmer's busi- ness, if ene\\ifably causes a considerable waste of money in drink, and leads to ti,e acquisition of habits the reverse of business ones-no trades can be more dissimilar than fanning alltl fighting. With regard to waste of power on a farm, how cften do we see three or four horses pulling one before another; instead of a couple of rather stronger ones, abreast, close to their work \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd farmers seem to think a horse's keep ot small value it is rare to see a steam enc,ritie in %ttips doiit, ,ill the lit-avy work, as it is common in Scotland. Good roads on a farm are far the cheapest, as they save hoise power alld avoid wear and tear to the c,irts and harness, 111111 al ow ot greater dispatch\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdbetter roads will permit the carts and harness also to be lighter and more simple. Few things act more pr.judicially to the landowner in the end than the law he has made to give himself a pre- ference over other creditors by the power of distraint so long as it exists it will render capitalists shy of lending to a homer, it has the effect of causin\"- the \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2- xw mi inn/ua vi uiS> ItniJinr, and perhaps this pn'viitge has had more to do with low, ti!e of' (lit- farming class than we at first see comparatively few men of any spirit would follow a farmer's trade with its semi feudalisms, so long as any other more free and independent business was open. Although the trudesmnnshoutfd keep correct ac- counts, and tit nigh the neglect ill doing so would perhaps prevent a bankrupt getting his certificates \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd how often farmers wholly omit it How few farmers in this cou> try know the cost of their wheat or oxen yet this knowledge is essential if they are to have a fair chance of success. On many ( n addition to the circumstances already referred to) it is pioliaide that a reduction ot rent may be jiece-saiy. Through want of attention both from owner and tenant (they both relied upon Parliament, not their own exertions, to give them profits) farming has become a wastefuily conducted trade (as is the ca-e with all piotected trades) and th\" honourable feeling in the mind of the landlord will not allow him to Iel all the ill effects of joint bad management tall upon the poor tenant alone, they will surely come forward and take a share of the tem- porary distress, and in the end, agriculture in this country will occupy the high position it ought. To meet the present difficulties, would not sui h a plan as the following be pose a fantl now fairly rented at twen:y-.S t' i,er acl'F-tO Dltlet the outlay necessary for v n/emeiits to raise a greater quantity of food; it tenant have it 011 a fifty years' lease at fifteen shillings perncre for the first ten years, and thirty shillings per ar-i-e for the re- mainder of the terul-if a tenant had full controul to do everything he liked with the )a) d and produce (of course giving full security that he would invest a certain sum during the first ten years in permanent improvements), can anybody doubt the complete suc- cess of the farmer, and would not the landlord, in the end, get more rent than he can do by any other plan ? In the best feeling these remarks are written, and if they cause a little discussion only, they cannot fail to awaken a desire to enquire further into the usual manner of holding and working land. A FREE TRADER. Wrexham, March 18th, 1850. THE CHURCH IX WALES. BlR,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdTn the last 11^;aid' I see announced that Mr. Williams, M.i\\, has moved for certain returns from the four Welsh dioceses. What may be Mr. Wil- liams's ulterior proceedings, in obtaining the I, of course, know not. Similar returlls have, from time to time, been made frum the different dioceses in England and Wales without any extensive benefit. Still, Mr Williams's step is one in the right direction. Had he also moved for a return of all the clerical de- linquencies, (such as instances of drunkeness, pugilism, among the clergy), in the dioovst: ot't. Asaph within the last three or four years, with a view of hav- ing the church rtlieved from such monstrosities, it would have tended to some good, and I would with your permission, respectfully suggest to your clerical and church coirespondents who, week after week,:n their well-meant zeal for the church in Wales, attack the present bishop of the diocese,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwhether they would not more effectually promote their object,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe improvement of the church, by aiding the bishop in detecting arid punishing those clerical delinquents who degrade their office, und do far greater injury to the church than her avowed enemies. The ostensible grievance seems to be that the bi- shop is not a Welshman. Neither was the late Bishop of St. Asaph, nor is the present respected Bishop of Bangor a Welshman. Yet they appear to have es- caped these virulent attacks, heaped on Bishop Short. I fully believe that the real cause of the hatred ta the bishop is his vigilance and activity in diocese, his refusing to prefer clergymen of unworthy cha.-acter, his liberal views which do not suit the high and dry church;\" and his condescending and kind mannet, coupled with his unostentafious \"equipage,\" which do not agree with the notions of episcopal dignity, enter- tained by ou,- honour and preferment hunters. Your corr< poudfcuts' pIU ?'oi, in the I Herald' Of the 9th inst. to the bishop's \"equipage\" and his rest- ing in London, was ill-placed and ill-timed. Your said correspondent may not be aware of the bishop last summer having made his tour through the diocese, no! in a slendid equipage\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffddriving, Jehu-like, foui horses reeking and foaming; but quietly in a plain phaeton, with a couple of horses, going from parish t' parish to call upon his clergy; and, to the writer's Knowledge, where he found clergymen of good charac- ter and in distressed circumstances, contributing in the most <y licate manner to the aid of those clergymen. I shoufd think that your correspondent's allusion to Xero fiddling while Rome was burning, is much more applicable to those ofoui- diocese who drink ami fi^ht, and hunt and sport, while the church is sinking, than to a bishop who by his activity and watchfulness endeavonrs to improve his clersry, and, through them, the state of religion in the church in Wales. I am grieved with and ashamed of the illiberal con- duct of my countrymen towards an Englishman which conm.stH mightily with the liberal and generous con- duct of the English to my clerical countrymen in England.

It is right the public should be acquainted with the state ot things in the Xorthern di ision also. From the accredited returns now before me, there appear to be in the six Counties of North Wales 5D6 Chap- 's ani Stations belonging to the Calvinists; \"271 ditto to the Independents and 203 to the Wenleyans making a total of 1,070 dissenting places of worship. Allowing three services on an average per week to each ot the-e, the result will be that there are pro- vided by the dissenting in'erest 3.210 Welsh services per week tor the population of the Dioceses of St. Asaph and Bangor. The Bishop of St. Asaph has asserted that no class of men work harder than the Bishops\" It were be- iide my purpose to speak of these labours in England. If your readers will cast their eyes over the extract, they will see at once, that the English Bishops in North Wales, with all their vast resources, only pro- vide 410 services per week in the native language of their flocks.

Yours truly, GLEWLWYD GAVAELVAWR. THE COMMERCIAL INTERESTS OF ABER- YSTWYTH. SIR,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt is a remarkable fact that, although the tradesmen of Aberystwyth have bfjen for years com- plaining of various evils under which they have la- boured and suffered, no attempt has been made to bring matters to a more favourable state. Tne apathy with which things have been treated is remarkahle to a degree. We trust a lew words on the subject will prove serviceable in rousing their energies, and caus- ing them to bestir themselves in a manner most likely to prove beneficial to their own interests and that of the public generally. Ope of the greatest evils is the want of rapid transit to or from any of the commercial districts to Aber- ystwyth it is one which is of more vital import than has hitherto been supposed; and surely something should have been done ere this to remedy so tiagrant a want. Let it be remembered that at the present, any town, not immediately connected with steam communi- cation, either by land or sea, is a full century behind the more spirited enterprisers of other parts; and why should this part of Wales be so very backward in this respect, while every other town and county are striving might and main to obtain an object of such peculiar benefit ? A steamer has long since been proposed, to act in conjunction with those from the ports of Livei- pool, Bristol, &c.; why, then, let the proposition flag ? Tradesmen should recollect of what benefit quick re- fUI'ns are, before they so stubbornly resist the enticing offers that have so repeatedly been mads to them from arious quarters. Let them consider that numerous \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2 ominerial gentlemen have to make their calls in some instances, months before the goods arrive, owing to the extreme uncertainty of their transit. Interest of money lies dormant, and to his own sheer want of forwarding so decidedly beneficial an affair, he will \u00e2\ufffd\u00a2ot tinue year after year to suffer a grievous loss, wh ch altogether prevents his competing with his more pu hing and enterprising fellow-tradesmen in other aoes. Time was, we had a stf&|QQi> plying for a few months, which proved of rery essential bet efit, both is to the me. ns of tral,sitiou for goods and passengei fl,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe latter of which ought by no means to form an unim- portant item in the scale of import. But in whichever way the question may be taken, it is a certainty that the utility of ste/lm navigation to this town is undenia- ble and the sooner such an excellent scheme is put into operation, the more permanent the benefits arising from it. It is to be hoped that the principals of the various commercial houses transacting business with the Ab'-r- ystwyth tradesmen, will toso do their utmost in tor- warding the measure, as it must likewise prove as eminently beneficial to them as to the trade of the town itself. Trusting you will excuse my being so prolix, I am, Sir, yours, &c., A YOUNG TRADESMAN. Aberystwyth, March 19th, 1850. SIR,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdI beg to propose that if the 'Dee Conser- vancy Bill' should pass, it should have an amended ti- tle, thus A Bill to enable the City of Chestfr, to block and bank up the trade of the Dee, from Connah's Quay to the sea; and to enable the Riv\u00c2\u00ab.r Company, to reclaim estates out of the said river, at the public cost and charge. For that will be the true effcct of the bill. If, how- ever, it should get through the Commons, Thank God we have a house of Lords Yours truly, CYMRO-DEVA. SIR,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdInasmuch that from what I spoke at the Guild Hall meeting, on the 8th instant, some have imagined that I r.o not consider the observance of the Sabbath, a duty devolving upon Christians, andothers ure much surprised anil offended at an assertion made, which they deem both erroneous and injurious in its tendency. I trust you will kindly allow the following observations to appear in your valuable paper. It is obvious I presume, to all, except those who are enveloped in ignorance and superstition,, that the Jewish Sabbath, and that observed by Christians, is not one and the same day. The one was originally instituted to commemorate the works of Creation the other to celebrate the work of redemption the former being the seventh, and the latter the first day of the week. Though the Christian Sabbath in many re- spects, differs from the original one; yet believing that to observe th Sabbath is a perpetual obligation, I shall offer a few observations to establish the fact. It may naturally occur to the mind of the inquirer, if the Sabbath is a perpetual institution, why is it that Christians, instead of observing the Sabbath originally instituted, keep iiiotljei- (lav-tliiit is, the first (lity of \u00c2\u00abeel< as the Sabbath. In meeting this difficulty, v e must bear iu mind that the Sabbath is a thing entirely distinct trom the day on which it might be kept,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin other words the day might be altered without changing the substance of the institution. If the divine law- giver should so order, it might be observed on any, or successively on all the days of the week. If then, (as Dr. Dwighr pointedly remarked), the day on which Sabbath, or holy rest, was to he holden, should, by divine permission, be a different one from that ori- ginally established, the Sabbath, itself the substance of the institution, might still remain a perpetual institu- tion. The possibility of such a case is evident, from its original establishment. God did not bless and Hallow the seventh day, but as being the day on which the Sabbath was to be observed. Were tlie Sabbath appointed on any other day of the week, the blessings would follow it. No douht the Lord's day, which the primitive Christians observed, is an especial day, and set apart for an especial purpose. Should it be asked, why the first day of the week is kept a Sabbath, rather than any other day? the reply is because it is the day on which the Lord our Redeemer arose again from the dead. In Hebrews iv. 10, we learn it is a day kept for an expressed purpose, viz, to celebrate the Redeemer's rest from his mediatorial work upon earth For he that is entered into his rest, lie also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.\" Secondly, the perpetuity of the Sabbath is evident from the fact that it is enjoined by the fourth decalogue, Exodus xx. It is a fuet which cannot be denied, that there is no express command for the observance of the Sabbath, in the Ni-w Testament, but this seeming de- ficiency is amply supplied by the passage to which we have alluded. It will be admitted that the moral law, in the whole of its substance is inchangeable. The great design of salvation, instead of liberating any from obligation to observe this law, is t0 redeem n.uni.imJ trom guilt, and the pollute ul sin, in order that they may fulfil it. V-f only the glory of the Diety will ever i-o>oue to whine forth through the medium of \u00e2\ufffd\u00a0\u00e2\ufffd\u00a2lis law but the present and eternal happiness of men is inseparably connected with the obser vance of it. If then, our obligations to the moral law are eternal, it must follow that the observance of the Sabbath, being \u00c2\u00bb p\"t ot' law, is a perpetual obligation. Thirdly, since the institution is in its nature a per- manent establishment, it is highly reasonable to believe that nothing but all express command from the Divine law-giver is sufficient to abolish it. The scriptures, however, contain nothing which resembles an abroga- tion of it. When Christ abrogated the ceremonial and civil laws of the Jews, so far as they might he thought to extend to the gospel dispensation, it is incre- dible, that if this precept were to be abolished at all, neither he nor they should give a single intimation concerning the abolition. On the contra y, the ex- ample of the apostles and primitive Christions, deci- sively teaches us, that the day of Christ's resurrection is to be kept by the Christian. If it was the duty of our first parents to set apart one day in Seven to cele- hrate the work of creation, and the Israelites their mighty deliverance out of Egyptian bondage, is it not reasonable that Christians should have a Sahbath to eonnnemorate an unspeakably greater display of Di- vine goodness in the accomplishment of the great plan of salvation. Fourthly-The perpetual establishment of the Sab- bath, is evident from the fact, that in scripture it is exhibited as a type of the saints' rest in heaven. Now, every type has an existence, until it is consummated ill the substance which it represents, consequently the Sabbath must remain until the redeemed of every age shall be gathered unto their eternal rest in heaven, and time be swallowed up in eternity. Thus, although the observance of the Sabbath cannot be proved from an express command in the New Testament, yet, there are other grounds upon which its perpetuity is esta- blished, as upon an immovable basis. If asserting that there is no express command in the New Testa- ment, which is an obvious fact, is a cause of surprise and offence to any, the writer does not think it his duty to offer any remedy to such, for truth requires no apology, neither is there all evil result to be feared from the manifestation of any truth which the Bible contains. There are small men to be had, who are much sur- prised and offended at everything which does not ex- actly coincide with their quantum of knowledge, or narrow views. Divine truth, however, has nothing to fear. It may be clouded, and men may raise dust into its face but its career is like that of the sun, ir- resistible. I am, sir, yours, &0., W. RICHARDS, Baptist Minister. RHELTENIIAM. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd A very lamentable aflfair bas just taken place in this town, by which a highly re- spected family have been plunged into the deepest distress. Captain Douglas (late of the 16ih Regi- ment). who w-is recerlly tried and dismissed from her Majesty's service by court-martial for conduct \"unbecommg the character of an officer and a gen- tleman,\" in connection with some proceedings in the Island of Guernsey, has lately been residing at Cheltenham, wliete, among other families, he ob- tained an introduction to that of Mr. Letsam Elliott, a gentleman of fortune, resident in the ueighboorhod, in whose circle he is said to have experienced great kindness and hospitality. At the latter end of Feb- ruary Mr. Elliott was from home for a few days on a visit to Earl Fitzhardmge. His family attended one of the public balls held at Cheltenham during his absence and when about to return home, the youngest daughter, Miss Marianne Elliott, aged only 19 years, was found to be missing- On Inqlllrles being made, it was ascertained that the young lady eft the assembly rooms under charge of Captain Douglas, who had been present during the evening, and in frequent conversation with the family. An instant search was set on foot, but the unfortunate gnl's hiding place was not discovered, and nothing was heard of her until she returned home of her own accord on the following day. Precautions were then taken to prevent any repetition of the indiscretion, hut, unfortunately, they proved ineffectual, for, on the evening of Saturday, the 3rd inst., Miss Elliott quitted her father's roof in disguise, and proceeded to Capt. Douglas's lodgings, which she afterwards left by the mail train for London. Mr. Elliott im. mediately started in pursuit,and has since been in- defatigable in his endeavours to discover the retreat of his lost child, but hitherto without any success. Miss Elliott was somewhat short in figure, but very beautiful and accomplished, the idol of her family, and a universal favourite with all who knew her.

{"ocr": "THE WEATHER AND THE Crops.-The grain crops, excepting those sown upon cold wet lands, pre- sent a luxuriant appearance in all these districts. The Swedish turnips have in many places suffered so much from the ravages of the fly and wire worm as to re- quire a great breadth of land to be replanted, or sown with common turnips. In several places we are sorry to find that the potntoe haulms have, during the last week, presented an appearance which indicates the existence of the blight, which, in former years, proved so destructive to that valuable root. The quality of the potatoes up to the present time has been such as to induce a hope that the virulence of the disease has been so materially diminished as not to prove so de- structive as in byegone years. BURSTING OF A WATERSPOUT ON THE MOUN- TAIs.-On Tuesday, the twenty-ninth ult., about three o'clock in the afternoon, the quarrymen and other inhabitants of the Vale of Nantlle, were greatly alarmed by the noise of a roaring torrent, which appeared to be coming upon them. After some time of anxious suspense, the water was observed tumbling in cascades over the clift's of Cwmbysilin, a mountain on the south-west side of the vale and almost simultane- ously another torrent appeared issuing from the top of Mynydd-mawr, on the opposite side. The panic which the sudden surprise produced, caused the quarrymen to suspend all operations. Meanwhile the water came rushing on, and, carrying everything in its course, soon flooded the vale along its entire extent. In the vale of Bettws, situated between Carnarvon and Beddgelert, there was a similar torrent from the mountains and ia the vale of Llanberis the same sudden flow of water from the mountains occurred, exeeding both in volume and violence those of either of the above places. Several grass fields and much vege- tation were destroyed, and the houses were inundated to a considerable extent. A public-house, Ty'nllan, had thirty inches of water upon the ground floor, where none nud never been previously witnessed. The two lakes were, in a very short time, swelled into one, and appeared discoloured to its centre. Some severe losses of hay and other damages to property have been sustained. The falls seem to have been general along the entire mountain rid\u00c2\u00b0-e.

CUSTOMS, JULY 30TIl.-The retirement of Roper Weston, Esq., collector of Weymouth, has caused the following changes in this department of the public service :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMr. Costerton, collector of Bridgewater, to be collector at Weymouth; Mr. Hughes, comptroller at Drogheda, to be collector at Bridgewater; Mr. Cronin, collector at Tralee, to be comptroller at Drogheda; Mr. Heatley, comptroller at Wick, to be collector at Tralee; Mr.' Nesbitt, comptroller at Kin- sale, to be comptroller at Wick. We are glad to find the name of Mr. Hughes, of Drogheda, late comptroller at this port, in the above list of promotions and the same pleasurable feeling will be entertained by our readers generally on this portion of the Welsh coast,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd for the ability, rectitude, and urbanity with which that officer discharged his duties to the Crown, during his long residence at Carnarvon, were not more accu- rately appreciated by his official superiors, and by those whose conduct it was his duty to inspect, than were his courtesy, hospitality, and private virtues by the extensive circle of friends who shared the pleasure of his acquaintance.

Nothing as yet has been heard of the boat. It is supposed she may still be on the surface. A reward has been offered, with the view of finding out the parties. She had on at the time a foremast and mizzeu-mast, with the sails clued to them. I THE STEPHENSON BANQUET.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdTickets for Mr. Stephenson's dinner, at twenty-five shillings each, have been issued, and the skeleton of the woolen tent or building, where it is to take place, appears in a fiel(I adjoining the George Hotel, Iwar Bangor. We are sorry to learn that dutinir the last few days printed letters, soliciting subscriptions, to make up the sum of 250Z., have been extensively eirculated throughout all parts of the country. Considering the long list of influential and wealthy names of the gentry and clergy of the Principality that was publicly advertised as forming the committee, when the banquet was first de- termined upon, it is much to be regretted, for the sake of all parties, that efficient steps had not been taken :is a preliminary to provide the requisite funds. Had those steps been taken, the awkward necessity of pur- suing, as it were at the eleventh hour, a course that can- not but be extremely annoying to all those gentlemen whose names, as being the original promoters of the fete, have been placed so prominently before the public, would not have occurred. To issue printed letters, urgently soliciting subscriptions at so late a period, does not seem respectful towards the committee collee- tively, nor complimentary individually towards Mr. Stephenson. The honour of the Principality is impli- cated, and the inhabitants have a right to be explicitly tol,l the names of the parties with whom the proposed dinner originated, as we:l as to he supplied with the names of those to whom the out of the ar- rangements has been entrusted.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Communicated.

The master, wife, and three of the crew had left in a boat for Har- mouth, leaving three of the crew on board. The vessel was taken off the Causeway, apparently having sus- tained but little damage, and was brought by the sal- vors safe to this harbour, where she now remains. Had it not been for the timely arrival of the Margaret, the vessel, in all probability, would have been a total wreck. Porn MADOO.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe weather, this week, has been all that could be desired, to enable the upland farmer to secure his hay, and to mature and ripen the corn crops. Several patches of rye and barley have been cut during the last few days and if this weather con- tinue, the harvest will be an abuudant and early one. We, however, much regret to find that the potatoe disease has again made its appearance, more particu- larly after the late rains,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdpatches of second-early varieties have become quite blaokened in the short space of forty-eight hours, emitting a powerful stench and on close examination, several of the tubers, al- though previously sound, have, in the same short space, become diseased and rotten.

CHESTER AND HOLYHEAD RAILWAY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWe under- stand that a gentleman known to be able, active, and possessed of great railway experience has been com- missioned by the Chester and Holyhead board to de- velope the Dublin traliic via Holyhead. It is pretty evident that there is scope for this, since the Chester and Holyhead line now gets but a small portion of the traffie. Liverpool takes it away. Why ? One reason is that the Holyhead route is 13?. 611. higher in the fare than the Liverpool. Another, that under the present arrangements there is little or no saving over Liverpool in the point of time by the night trains. As the Holyhead route is the better one, it requiresbutgood, shrewd arrangements to take the traffic. As regards the distance by sea, Holyhead possesses a great advan- tage. From Liverpool to Dublin is about 138 miles; while from Holyhead to Dublin it is but 70 miles or thereabouts. The one is therefore about double the other in point of sea passage, and we all know how glad the majority of travellers are to abridge this sort of travelling during which they are mostly ill, or exist in the fear of it. Arrangements are being made by which the time of a trip to Dublin will be in favour of Holyhead by three hours. This arrangement is to come into operation on the first of September next. In regard to the traffic between Dublin and Liverpool, the Chester and Holyhead receive none of it, owing to the enormous difference in the fares by the two routes. There is a large traffic between Dublin, Liverpool, Manchester, &c., and as the Chester and Holyhead must run their mail trains, it would be a vast deal bet- ter for them to have them filled with cheap passengers than none at all. We have no doubt that a great deal is to be done for the Chester and Holyhead by judicious management in the way of increasing the traffic. The gentleman commissioned by the Chester and Holyhead board to take it in band is not appointed a permanent officer of the Company, but employs a month or two's interval between relinquishing one railway engagement (fulfilled for many years) and another of a permanent charaoter, in thus seeing what can be done for the Chester and Holyhead Company. Mr. Peto, the Chairman of the Chester and Holyhead Company, is no doubt the main-spring of this movement. He is not a man to sit down quietly under disappointment. On the contrary, he is one of those active, stirring, and powerful spirits of the age which never rests till they have reached success, or never \"give up\" till they find going on perfectly hopeless, and a waste of en- eri;y.-Re,ra atli's Journal.

We are glad to learn that Mr. Ilengler met with that encouragement in Rhyl, on Thursday last, he so i-iolily deserved. The j circus was filled, and the completeness of the fitting up was only equalled by the strength of the pavillion. There were full 1,600 people present, who were highly gratified. Our correspondent says, the young Pa- laski has no parallel; and the clown, Mr. Knight, at intervals enlivens the amusements with better spirit and taste than is usual in these exhibitions. The mon- key steeple chase is exceedingly clever. The perform- ance of Mr. Hengler, and the first-rate training of his animals are surprising.\" For route of the company see advertisement. AMLWCH CHORAL SOCIETY. -This rising institution already contains G5 members. Mr. Jones, flour mer- chant, is the principal conductor. The voices are under the management of experienced tencliers,-Alessrs. J. Palmer and W. Evans, conduct the air; Mr. Benjamin Jones, Pensarn, tenor; Mr. S. Roose, Drug hall, coun- ter and Mr. L. W. Lewis, Pensarn, bass. It is to be hoped the Amlwch public will universally support the society and our correspondent adds, \"from what we have witnessed of their capabilities, there is every prospect that in a short time we shall have concerts of sacred music to enliven our winter evenings.\" LLANGEFNI.-The lovers of church music in this town have had quite a festival for the last few days. On Friday, the 25th ult., the local church choir so ably conducted by Mr. Davies met to the number of 40, in the Rectory ground, to enjoy a sumptuous supper, the third kindly given by Mr. and Mrs. Owen since they came to the place. On this occasion the singers went through several of their favourite pieces in a manner which drew very complimentary remarks from the Rev. Charles Williams, of Holyhead, and the Rev. C. P. Ellis, of Llanfaes, addressed them. On Saturday also a good detachment of the far-famed choir of Llan- Ilechid paid a visit to their old pastor and fellow churchmen, at Llangefni, and a regular coueert was given in the school room to a crowded audience, at five o'clock, in the middle of which a suitable break was made, by the delivery of a short lecture on church unity, by one of the churchwardens of Llanllechid, who had accompanied the singers into After being most hospitably entertained by the Rector and his lady, they proceeded to Llanerchvmedd, and on Sunday morning: attended the church, which was ex- ceedingly well attended. The audience seemed highly pleased with the singing, and the manner in which they intoned the service. They attended the little church of Coedanna at two o'clock, and arrived at Llang-efni by the six o'clock service. The church here was most densely crowded, every pew and hench being fully occupied, with scarely standing room in the body of the church. From the attentive manner in which the congregation listened to the service and singing, we are led to believe that they duly appreciated the visit of the choir, which has now the second time given its services at Llangefni. IIAKLECII.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdlJic Nic.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn Tuesday, the 29th ult., a respectable party of ladies and gentlemen consisting of Capt.

After partaking of cold collation within its walls, they spent some hours in examining the fortress, after which they proceeded to the Blue Lion Hotel, to tea. The remainder of the evening was agreeably spent in hearing the harp played in a masterly manner by the well known harper, Evan Jones, who has been engaged for the summer season at the Hotel. DENBIGHSHIRE AND FLINTSHIRE AGRICULTU- RAL SOCIETY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt will be seen by advertisement in another column that the annual meeting of this society will be held in Ruthin on the 23rd of September. We, however, understand, that the president, Lord Feiiding, and the vice-president, Col. Myddleton Biddulph, will not be at that time in the country and that both will be represented by leading gentlemen of their respective counties. We sincerely hope the meeting will be well attended, and that the talents of the leading agricul- turists will be directed to the best means of improving the agriculture of the Principality. Great and praise- worthy efforts have been made by many gentlemen in ths (Iii-ectiori but, although farming generally has, during the last twenty years greatly improved, much further progress must take place before Welsh agricul- ture will rank with that of England and Scotland. AN UNCOMMON CASE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA correspondent says,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Some time back, Hugh Williams, of Ty Newydd, Llanddulas, aged 79 years, fell off a cart, and many thought that he was dead but Mr. Edwards, the ac- tive surgeon at Abergele, was soon on the spot, and found that the poor man had fractured his left thigh- bone; and to the surprise of all his friends, ossification has taken place, and lie is so far recovered that he can walk to Abergele and back, a distance of five miles.\" THE ANCIENT ORDER OF FORRESTERS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThis benevolent society held its 7th anniversary on Wednes- day last, at the Bee Inn, Bettws, Abergele. When all the members had assembled, they marched in a body to the parish church, where was delivered an im- pressive discourse by the Rev. E. Evans. From church they returned to the Bee, where a sumptuous dinner awaited them. No delicacies which the season afforded seemed wanting, nor did the manner in which things were got up betray a want of care or a saving disposition. After dinner was over and the cloth drawn,W. Ll. Edwards, Esq., surgeon, was unanimously elected president amongst the hurrahs of the brave forresters. The worthy president in dwelling upon the utility and advantage of such societies, and in ex- plaining their origin, recalled to memory the light of other days,\" and the heart of every Cymro present must have leaped when he touched with so much ten- derness upon the memory of our warlike forefathers. During the remainder of the evening several toasts were given and followed successively by enthusiastic cheers. The Queen, Prince Albert, and all the royal family, the prosperity of the society from the chair. The Rev. E. Evans, from Mr. H. Roberta, Mr. T.

Ro- berts and Mr. J. Davies, Nant-y-fedw, was encored. In conclusion a vote of thanks was returned to the worthy hostess for her excellent preparation. The noble spirited old lady said that nothing could give her moro pleasure than to find that she had given sa- tisfaction, and concluded wishing the society could hold another anniversary the following day in the same place. RUTHIN.-Pi-oposed Festivities.-At the meeting convened according to requisition by the mayor on Saturday last. it was unanimously agreed that James Peers, Esq., write to F. R. West, Esq., to request the honour of his company, and that of his son, Mr. F. M. West, to dinner at the Lion Hotel, on the day of the latter young gentleman attaining his majority. It was decided that should Mr. West meet the wishes of the requisitionists, and accept the invitation, steps be immediately taken to carry out the demonstration with all possible eclat. For this purpose the following were named as a committee to carry out all future proceedings. Gabriel Roberts, Esq.; J. Peers, Esq. R. Ellis, Esq. R. Edwards, Esq., mayor; Spier Hughes, Esq. the Rev. the Warden of Ruthin; Dr. Prytherch, Mr. J. Jones, agent Dr. T. C. Jones, Mr. A. Higginson, Mr. J. J. Bancroft, Mr. R. Lloyd, Mr. J. Edwards, Mr. R. Roose, Mr. R. W. Evans, and Mr. William Davis,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdfour to form a quorum. The meeting was then adjourned till the following Tues- day. On that day, in consequence of the Assizes not being finished, there was no meeting. BONT UCHEL LADIES CLUB, NEAR RUTHIN.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe celebration of this reunion having been postponed, out of respect to Mrs. Tumor's family, it has been deter- mined that the anniversary shall be celebrated on the same day as the dinner in honour of the nuptials of the Hon. William Bagot with the Hon. Miss Ellice,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd thus adding to the other festivities in honour of the wedding. As this club stands A. 1 in estimation in the country, and is always well attended, there is no doubt that on this occasion the pleasures of the mem- bers will be highly increased, and that the influx of strangers will be greater than on any former oceasion. FLINT EISTEDDFOD.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe arrangements for this bardic congress and musical festival are progressing most favourably, and the committee have engaged that eminent performer on the Welsh harp, Mr. Ellis Ro- berts, harpist to his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, to attend on the occasion. The procession to the ancient Castle of Flint, a fortress so interesting from historical associations, will be most striking. The well known song O let the kind minstrel attune his soft lay,\" will be sung on the ground, with two ad- ditional verses written especially for the occasion by Mr. P. Ellis Eyton, the honorary secretary. The exe- cution of the silver medals and harp has been entrusted to Mr. Aronson, of Bangor, and the designs are very pleasing. Compositions for the various prizes adver- tised are pouring in by every post. The Mold Cym- reigyddion and the Holywell Philharmonic Societies have joined with the committee heart and hand,\" to promote the objects of the Eisteddfod. The concert in the evening will be diversified by the exquisite per- formance of Mr. Ellis Roberts on the Welsh harp, Within the concave of its womb is found, The magic strains of soul-enchanting sound.\" Many local stars\" are to be present, and will, no doubt\" shine\" in brilliant lustre. John Williams, Esq., M.P., of Bronwylfa, and other Welsh patriots have been invited to attend, and the good people of Flint are determined upon having a day that will long be remembered.-See Advertisement.

{"ocr": "A fatal accident in hunting, with the Shropshire hounds, occurred on Tuesday to C. S. Stokes, Esq., youngest son (if the Rerereiid J. C. H. Stokes, of Abbey Foregate, in Shrewsbury. The meet was at Leaton Shelf, and the hounds had found at Preston Gubbals, and were in full cry towards Battlefield when near Preston Guhbals, on the offside of a fence, there was a pit 10 feet deep, to avoid which they had to turn on one side, and it was supposed that instead of doing so. Mr. i Stokes' horse rushed straight over the cap and stunibl<:i into the pool. Mr. Stokes was then unseated, and was struggi ng a short time with his hands and whip above the water, unable to reach the bank, apparently sinking into the mud, which was very deep. Peter Beck, Esq., of this town, who had just passed the place, on hearing thestrucule turned back, and want into the pool, but the deceased had disappeared, and Mr. Beck found himself so fast sinking into the muddy bottom (immediately getting up to his chin) that h:> was obliged to return, whid,\" he only did by the assistance of a whip that was thrown to him. Assistance was obtained, but it was half an hour before the body was got out.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Eddoires's Journal. THE PAST AND PRESENT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt is of some importance at what period a man is born. A young man, alive at this period hardly knows to whatimprovments of human life he has been introduced and I would bring before his notice the following eighteen changes, which 'have taken place in England since I began to breathe the breath of lif-a period amounting now to nearly seventy years. Gas was unknown I groped my way about the streets of London in all but the utter darkness of a twinkling oil lamp, under the protection of watchmen, in their climacteric, and exposed to every species of degradation and insult. I have been nine hours in sailing from Dover to Calais, before the invention of stea,n. It took me nine hours to go from Taunton to Bath, and now I can go in six hours from Taunton to London. In going from Taunton to Bath, I suffered between 10,000 and 12,000 contusions, before stone- breaking Macadam was born. I paid il,5 in a single year for repairs of carriage springs, on the pavement of London and now I glide without noise or fracture on wooden pavement. I can walk, by the aspistance of the police, from ore end of London to the other, without molestation; or, if tired, get into a cheap and active cab, instead of those cottages on wheels, which the hackney coaches were at the beginning of my life. I had no umbrella They were little used, and very dear. There were no waterproof hats, and my hat has often been reduced to its primitive pulp. I could not keep my small clothes in their proper place, for braces were unknown. If I had the gout, there was no colchicum. If I was bilious, there was no calomel. If I was attacked by ague, there was no quinine. There were filthy coffee- houses instead of elegant clubs. Game could not be bought. Quarrels about uncotnmuted tithes were endiess. The corruption of Parliament, before reform, was infamous. There were no banks to receive the saving oi the poor. The poor laws were gradually sapping the vitals of the country. '\"hclever miseries I suffered, I had no post, to whisk my compiaints, for a single penny, to the remotest corners of the empire. And yet, in spite of all these privations, I lived on quietly, and am now ashamed that I was not more discontented, and utterly surprised that all these changes and inventions did not occur two cen- turips ago. I forgot to add, that, as the basket of stae coaches, in which luggage was then carried, had no springs, your clothes were rubbed all to pieces :ind that, even in the best society, one-third of the gentle- men, at least, were always drunk.-Pev. Sidney Smyth's Works. SK\\sK AM) SENSATION.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe greyhound runs by eye- sight only, and this we observe as a fact. The carrier- pigeon flies his two hundred and fifty miles homeward, h' eye-sight, viz., from point to point of objects which he has m irkcd; but this is only our conjecture. The fierce dragon-fly, with twelve thousand lenses in his eyes, darts from anle to angle with the rapidity of a flashing sword, and as rapidly darts hack-not turning in the air, hut with a clash reversing the action of his four wings\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe oniy know;\u00c2\u00a1 creature that possesses this faculty. His sight then, both forwards and back wards, must be pro- portionately rapid with his wings, and instantaneously calculating the distance of objects, or he would dash himself to nieces. But in what con formation of his eye does this consist? No one can answer. A cloud of ten thousand gnats dances up and down in the sun, the gnats being so close together that you can scarce see J the minutest interval between them, yet no one knocks another headlong upon the grass, or breaks a leg or a wing, long and delicate as these are. Suddenly, amidst your admiration of this matchless dance, a pe- culiarlv high-shouldered vicious gnat, with lon, pale, pendant nose, darts out of the rising and falling cloud, and settling on your chock inserts a poisonous sting, What possessed the little wretch to do This: Dill he smell your blood in the inazy dance 5 No one knows.

I have, &c., SAMUEL PECK. SIR JDIES GIBSON CRMO. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Scarcely is the grave well closed on Lord Jeffrey, who did so much to promote the cause of the Whig party in Scotland, ere Ai-c baie to announce the dent,, of one, who, although possessing none of the talents for which that accomplished writer and critic was distinguished, yet contrived, in his own peculiar way, to render himself a scarcely less effective ally of that party, among whom, even up to the period of his death, lie excised a considerable influence in all matters relating to Scotland. The gentleman to whom we allude is Sir James Gibson Craig, leadin., partner of the firm of Messrs. Craig, Dalziel, and Brodie, writers to the signet in Edinburgh. He had been for a long time in a very infirm state of health, and died, somewhat suddenly, at his mansion-house of Riccarion, about four miles from Edinburgh, on Wednesday. Sir James Gibson Craig was born in 1765, and was consequently upwards of eighty-ifve years of age. He passed as a writer to the signet in 1686. and is among the oldest on the list of that numerous and-respectable body of legal practitioners. The deceased baronet took a prominent part in all the great political struggles of this country from 1792 downwards, and was on terms of intimacy with Fox and most of the leaders of the old Whig school. As an acknowledgment of the services which he ren- dered to i tiat party, he was created a Baronet of the United Kingdom in 1831 by the Government of Earl Grey. Sir James Gibson Craig always took a deep in- terest in the local politics of the Scottish metropolis, and he figures prominently in the sarcastic ballad against the Whigs written by Sir Alexander Boswell in 1822, and which gave rise to tlie duel between the writer of it and lr. Stuart, of Duncaru, in which the fonm r was shot. Sir James will be succeeded in his title and estates by his non, Mr. William Gibson Craig, one of the members for the city of Edinburgh. THE ADVENTURES OF A FIVE SIIILLING PROSECC-- TION.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe perfection of reason is at present in full course of illustration at the as.-izcs. As usual, some of the illustrations are curious. The perfpction of reason, provides amongst other things, that all persons selling on a SlInday shaH be fined jive siiilliiig., Now it ap- pears that Mr. Barton, of Eynsham, in Oxfor(]?hire, hJ!d one pennyworth of walnuts on a Sunday in No'ern- her last. The house was cloed and the blinds down- nevertheless, he sold the walnuts. Whereupon the Rev. Mr. Bricknell, vicar of the parish, su-nmoned the said Barton to answer the charge before the pettv sessions. Eynsham, it further appears, is in Woodstock district, bat the citation dragged the vender of walnuts to Wit- ney, the rev. gentleman's own bench, where, to the credit of the activity of the bench, the said rev. gentleman was tlie only magistrate present. He decided at.d convicted of course, the penalty comprehending, besides the f ve shillings, the expenses of a guinea to the informing constable for taking the trouble to walk across the road. Now the perfection of reason enacts that the lines anil expenses may be le\\ied by distress, or in defaul, of pay. ment the offender may be put in the stocks. The Iiev. B. (ii(i bt)tli. He issued the warrant of dis- tress first then put Barton in the stocks; and, lastly, took the n.oney. This w IS too much even for the per- fection of reason. An action.lay against the Rev. Mr. Bricknell. But by a very recent Act of Parliament, before an action can lie in such a case, the conviction must be quashed by the Court of Queen's Bench. Into this court, therefore, this important affair was taken, and the cOf!<ic:illf1 was duly quashed accordingly, and then the affair, after going before the magistrate first, and and the judges in banco afterwards, came before judge and iurv at the assizes at Oxford. Even then it did iiot appear how the terms of the statute required the action to be brought. It was brought for damage and the expenses incurred in quashing the conviction but whether it was to he brought on account of the wrong issue of the warrant of distress or II\". Hpither counsel or judge seems to be aide to say. The decision of that part of the matter was left for the judges. The jny decided on the merits of the case by giving the plaintiff the expenses demanded. On the law of the case, the pennyworth of walnuts hr.s once more to appear before the judges in full conclave. As the Frenchman said, whpn it thundered vehemently, while he transgressed j the canon by eating an onielette du Init on a Friday \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd the noise seems too great fur so small a drop of n ilk.

DEATH or GENF.ITAL PA KEN HA M.-Major-General the Hon. Sir Hercules Rowley PakeDham, who fell at New Orleans, and brother-in-law to the Duke of Wellington, died, suddenly, on Thursday evening, the 7th inst. about 10 o'clock at Langford-lodge, the family lesiaence in the county of Antrim. Ge- neral Pakenham was about 70 years of age and, as an officer, had earned a good character by his ser- vices in the Peninsular war. Subsequently to his retirement from active service, he received the appoint- ment of Governor of Portsmouth. Latterly, he lived in the enjoyment of great domestic felicity, on the peace- ful banks of Lough Neah, amidst the cheerful society of an amiable and exemplary family. Sir Hercules served at the siege and capture of Copenhagen, in the year 1807 also in the Peninsular campaigns of 1808, 1809, 1810, 1811, and 1812, including the battles of Roleia, Yimiera (wounded).

A SUFFERING HEno.-A Commission of Lunacy was heW last week on Mr. Thomas Fears, an tDmare of Bethle- hem Hospital, whose insanity was caused by severe sabre wounds which he received at the battle of Waterloo. Mr. Fears formerly served in her Majesty's 56th Foot, and has a property of about \u00c2\u00a32,000 in the funds. The jury found that the insanity commenced in the year 1842. DR. ACHJLLI.- This distinguished man was on Thursday received with immense applause by a very numerous meeting at Exeter Hal!, to congratulate him on his escape. It was explained that, being taken out of prison by the French that he might attend a court martial, he had, while waiting to be examined, an oppor- tunity of dressing himstlf as a French soldier, and thus effected his escape. THE STANFIF.LD HALL PR(,-ERTY. Since the family of the late Mr. Jermy have left their residence at Stanfield Hall, it had remaned tenantless. On Saturday last two men, named Jermy and Lamer, took and retained possession until th police were sent 'ir, but prudently withdrew before 'he arrival of the latter. Loss OF A STEAMER: 32 rERSOS DROWNED.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd The steamer R! de Island, irom New York to Cali- fornia, was struck by a heavy sea in the Gulf of Mexico on the 29th Jan and broke in two. Only 12 out of 44 persuns were saved. They took to the jolly boat, and were next day picked up b: a brig bound to Porto Rico. The other boat with thirty persons was swamped. NEW ROUTE TO AUSTRALIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe emigrant ship Constancy, arrived at Adelaide, from Plymouth, in seventy-seven days, the average period of the voyage being cne hundred and ten days. By adopting a new track she effected saving of one thousand miles. ATTEMPTED MURDER NEAR SHEFFIELD.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA case of attempted murder, < f a most distressing character, occurred at Ecclesfiekl on Wednesday last. The in- jured party is Jane, the wife of Joseph Wadsworth, of Potter Hill, Kcclesfied, and the assailant Ann Laycock, a single woman, residing with her father at Charlton Brook. It appears that about five years ago Joseph Wadsworth paid his addresses to Laycock, and the result of his acquaintance was an illegitimate child. Wadsworth afterwards broke hi-* engagement and mar- ried another woman. The ch!'d was affiliated upon \"adswortb before the magistrates, and he h?s since paid regularly for its maintalnance. Wadsworth's wife and the girl Laycock had been on friendly terms with each other up to the piesent tim\". Laycock has a cted as h^usekeepei f ? her father, and t appears that about 10 days ago site showed such decui'V symptoms of insa- nity that her fattier, feeling it un.-afe to leave her alone, remained from his work, and m a medical man. On Wednesday sue was so muel better that, at her earnest intreaty, the father consented to go to his work, and it was arranged that he should spend the day at the house of Mr. John Smith, her uncle, wno resides within a few miles of Wadsworth's house. She went to Smith's, and, about 10 o'clock, left, saying fhe woiJd go and buy an orange. Wadsworiti's wife keeps a shop for the sale of spice and fruit, and Laycock wei.t there. She asked for oranges, and while Mrs. Wadsworth was reselling them from the window the wretched weinan stepped behind her, and slashed a razor across her threat, inflicting a fearful wound. Mrs. Wadsworth closed with her assailant, and .seized the hand in which she held the razor. They scuffled together, and in the scuffle got into the yard. Mrs. Wadsworth, who was far advanced in pregnancy, and unable to bear up against the frenzied madness of her assailant, screamed loudiy for assistance. The lu- natic succeeded in throwing her victim on the ground, ffll upon her. and repeated the endeavour to cut her throat. In defending herself, Mrs. \"Wadsworth seized the blade of the razor in her left hand, and succeeded in retaining Elr hold until several parties, who had heard the screams, came to her assistance and took her assailant off. Laycock was detained, and handed over to the custody of Mr. Shaw, the constable. The razor was found on the ground, and in the struggle both the scales had been broken. It was found that Mrs. Wadsworth had received three desperate wounds in the n-ek-one of them a most fearful gash, six inches in length-and that the larger blood vessel had been divided. The ends of two finge rs and a thumb on one hand were also cut off, and four of tne fingers on the same hand were cut across to the bone. The parties who had gathered round en- deavoured to stay the flow of blood from the frightful wounds in the throat by tying handkerchiefs, aprons, &c. rouud the neck. It fortunately happened that Mr. Turton, of Sheffield, surgeon, passed by a fv w minutes afterwards, and the woman being removed home he at- tended and sewed up the wound in the neck. Mr. Foster, surgeon, was also called ir, and remained in close attendance on her. The following morning, while in a precarious stau- from her wounds, she was deli- vered of a child, and we regret to state she is not yet considered out of danger. Laycock was removed to the TOlin-hail at Sheffield, and in consequence of her fran- tic state Mr. Raynor obtained an order for her admis- sion into the lunatic as)lum of the workhouse. We un \u00e2\ufffd\u00a0 derstand that while there she has made several attempts to commit suicide, and was in so violent a state yester- day that it was not considered safe to leave her alone. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd.SA??M 7??.?pfM?:<.

IFATAL ACCIDENT AT UXBRIDGE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn Thursday after- noon, between the hours of 4 and 5, a poor boy met his death under the following melancholy circu instances: -It appears that one of the soldiers of the 4th Light Dragoons, quartered at Uxbridge, had placed his carbine against the wall of a cottage on Uxbridge-moor, which was taken up by a boy in passing, who pointed it at another in play, and shot hifn dead. His body was removed in a cart to his mother's, house to, await the coroner's inquest. 'GOOD SOCIETY.-The Britannia says it is a fact well known to the police that upwards of one hundred and fifty season tickets, at three guineas each for admission to the Crystal Palace, have been purchased, by English thiefs. The vigilance of the police, however, has rendered the investment a bad speculation scearcely any robberies have been com- mitted. BAD LEGS AND WOUNDS OF ALL KINDS CURED BY HOL- LOWAY'S OINTMENT.-If these valuable medicines be used together according to the directions given with them, there is nq case, however, obstinate, bad, or long standing, but may be shortly cured by their surprising efficacy. Thou' sainds of persons who had been patients, in large hdspitals- and under the care of the greatest surgeons of the day without deriving the least benefit, as a last resource use Hollow'a s Ointment and Pills, which always cure them, and frequeatl, in M 1I\"le time a. a cut &Bget would require when treated in the usual way-. Vll tliuiaunj, w^vvtv.1^ r sons visited th Crystal Palace. The sum taken in shillings at the doors Was \u00c2\u00a3 2,379 7s. There were therefore 47,587 people who paid for entering, and 7,080 season ticket hold- ers. The clasfe who now come to the Exhibition remain a shorter time than their more fashionable predecessors. They generally arrive at an early hour, and begin to leave between one and two o'clock. Notwithstanding the immense num- bers the utmost order and propriety of conduct prevailed, nor was it necessary for the police to interfere except at one or two of the more attractive points, in preventing an undue accumulation of visitors. The Queen and htz illustrious guests came to the Building at their usual early hour, and remained for some time, as on former occasions, watching with curiosity and interest the influx of people when the doors were opened. Friday was the first half-crown day. The total number of persons who paid at the doors was 47,587: in addition to these there were about 7,000 holders of season tickets, most of whom arrived during the latter part of the day. Other- wise the attendance was pretty evenly maintained through- out the whole eight hours, few appearing to remain for a longer period than thiee -or four hours. There were perhaps a few more 6t the lower or labouring classes present than had been previously the case, but the great majority was still composed of the strictly middle classes. At no time previous to fdur o'clock was the building closely filled, but after that hour the throng was rather heavy. It was expected that on Saturday when the charge was 5s., there would have been an unusually numerous attendance, as it was thought that a vast number of people who had abstained from attending during the rest of the week, in consequence of the reduced price, would have crowded to view the wonders of the Glass Palace on the high price day but such was not the case. The drawing-room held on her Ma- jesty's birthday (together with a review at Woolwich and other attractions) diminished the resort of visitors to the Great Exhibition. During the first hour, from twelve till one, only about 4,000 entered the building, and about 2,900 during the second hour so that at two o'clock there were not 7,000 persons in the edifice. By four o'clock the num- ber had risen to 12,000, and by five o'clock to about 15,000. Among the visitors were Lord John Russell, Cardinal Wiseman, Lord Campbell, the Earl of Yarborough, Lord Hatherton, Lord G. Lennox, the Speaker, Sir James Graham, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Justice Pat- teson, Mr. E. Ellice, M.P., Mr. Hutt, M.P., Mr. Slaney, M.P., Mr. Sanders, M.P., Mr. P. Scrope, M.P., Mr. Hey- wood, Q.C., Mr. Whateley. Q.C. In the course of the afternoon some sensation was created by the appearance of a Spanish cavalier\" and his daughter, in the picturesque costumes of their nation. They prome- naded up and down for upwards of an hour, and excited much attention. At four o'clock, Mr. Best repeated, on Willis's Great Organ, his performance of selections from Mendel- ssohn, Handel, and Bach. The highly agreeable effect produced in the French depart.. ment of the Exhibition by the suspension of flags from the galleries facing the main avenue, has suggested to the Royal Commissioners the propriety of a similar decoration on the British side. It is proposed that each corporate town exhi- biting should send a banner bearing its arms, not too costly, yet sufficiently handsome to be worth preserving in its town hall or other public place as a memorial of the great indus- trial event. Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Bradford, and Huddersfield have ordered their several flags, which are to be of silk, the arms painted on both sides, six feet three inches long, by four feet six inches wide, attached to a blue staff, with a gilt spear head. Some interesting and not altogether purposeless discussion has been raised concerning the ultimate destination of the Exhibition. That there will be a surplus even after buying the Building, at E300,000, cannot be doubted, and some have even dared to suggest that the contents might be pur- chased also Our contemporary, the Athenceum, rapidly disposes of this dreamy suggestion. The lowest estimate of the value of the contents is twelve millions, and supposing the Commissioners were to receive E2,000 clear profit daily, it would be twenty years before the necessary sum could be raised. The Athenceum, taking for granted that the Royal Commissioners will purchase the Crystal Palace in the name of the English people, thinks that if it be then announced to all the present exhibitors in the first instance that such of them as have fitted up stalls or obtained space may retain them for, say a year, on the condition of keeping them filled with their present or other contributions of the same high class of excellence, a great majority of the most useful and beautirul artic l es -.voul d be le ,at? ority of the most useful and beautiful articles would be left. The workers in silk, wool, worsted, gold, silver, iron, and copper, mahogany and other woods\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe makers of musical and scientific instruments, watches, chronometers, carriages, agricultural machines and fountains; the producers of flowers and plants, decorators and stained-glass makers, sculptors and carvers in wood and ivory, printers and hard-workers of most kinds, would in all probability be glad to have such a universal and permanent exhibition-room for their wares, works, and discoveries. Many things of mere curiosity and rarity would no doubt be removed; but the absence of Koh-i-Noor, the Spanish jfwelsi the Indian diamonds, and similar articles, if it should be proved to lessen the mere splendour of the Exhibition, would not materially detract either from its moral interests or its practical usefulness.\" A great many cruel things have been said of Brother Jona- than and the space which the eagle's wings encompasseth,- a desolate prairie\" one of our contemporaries calls it-but in fair play his excuses should be heard in arrest of judg- ment. The Americans in London contend that in no one branch is the United States fairly or adequately represented and they appeal to the testimony of all Englishmen who have visited America.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe north, or New England State, is not represented, either as to the extent, the progress, or the variety of its manufactures. The middle States, that have long been famous for the invention and construction of some of the finest machinery in the world, have here but three or four machines. The southern States, which are principally agricultural, are certainly not represented. As an illustration of the many kinds of cotton cultivated, we find here but samples of seven, while the different varieties of sugar in the State of Louisiana are represented by one spe- cimen from a single plantation. The causes are thus given by an American writer:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" First, the want of sufficient infor- mation through the length and breadth of the States in reference to the character and extent of the Exhibition. This at present lies at the door of the Central Committee at Washington. Secondly, Congress has unfortunately appro- priated no fund, as in other countries, to assist exhibitors. And this has operated to strengthen the third cause\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe remoteness of the scene of action, an obstacle increased by the great extent of the country, which rendered the internal transmission of our contributions expensive and inconveni- ent, and even, in some instances, impracticable\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand which, added to the distance itself, made this a very onerous part of ourjtask, and formed a very considerable portion of-our outlay. The time for preparation, too, was. short, con- sidering the nature of the enterprise and the distance of the country.\" I THE AUSTRALIAN CONTRIBUTIONS. u south Australia exhibits a rich and extraordinary display of specimens from the celebrated copper mines of Burra Burra and although as a whole, the collection has apparently little to attract, the sources of great wealth are evident in the number and extent of her mineral productions, the variety and excellence of her cereal produce, and the rich and numer- ous specimens of timber adapted for shipbuilding, furniture, or cabinet work. A model of mine and smelting house is at- tached to the collection of ores, which includes cabinet specimens of the different qualities\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdmost of them are the green and blue carbonates and red oxides of copper-the former being the variety called malachite, so extensively used in the decorative arts. The peculiarity of the Burra Burra mine is that the minerals are found in them in conditions very unlike those which prevail in the English copper mines. The inference a mineralogist would naturally draw from them is that the whole of the mineral mass existed at one time as metallic copper, some specimens of red oxide still holding copper unchanged in the centre of the mass from red oxide it would appear to have passed into carbonate, the pre- vailing exterior crust of these singular formations. The drawings suspended from the walls give a general idea of the face of the country and the under ground workings the ore lies at an inconsiderable depth from the surface, and is easily worked, the exterior crust being clay, slate, and marl. Specimens of gold from the streams of a very extensive district indicate the presence of this precious metal. The geological specimens includc agates, jaspers, aqua marine, and opal, but none of sufficient purity have yet been discovered to make the working and polishing a profitable speculation. Some garnet and ruby ore, from the Kanmantoo mines, near Mount Barker, are more promising in their appearance. \"The vegetable produce is illustrated by a dried bouquet of wild flowers, somewhat injured on the voyage-samples of wheat, barley, and oats, and the flour of these different grains. There is also a box of native manufactured soap. Van Dieman's Land has a much lirger and more varied display, and has already made considerable advances in native manufactures. We have specimens of myrtle, musk, aud ironwood beauti- fully polished and worked up into articles of furniture, for which they appear to be well adapted blue-gum timber, pronounced equal to oak for. shipbuilding, and obtainable in any quantity or length up to 200 feet; stringy. bark for house- building and fencing blackwood of Tasmania, a very hard close-grained, and richly-veined cabinet wood sassafras, well adapted for turning and carving. Among the articles of furniture are a hall chair of blackwood, with a raised shield cut on the back, with kangaroo and emu for supporters, taste- fully carved in relief and polished a small round chess-table of Huon pine, the checkers of Huon pine and black oak of Tasmania, with a border of blackwood and a narrow string of myrtle, the whole enclosed by a band of figured pine a pier- table of polished blackwood, showing the rich dark tints and veining of the wood, and the high polish of which it is sus- ceptible. Another round table of muskwood, of great beauty, is remarkable from the brass-work and springs being entirely of Tasmanian manufacture. A sideboard of the akaqia mela- moxylon is considered to be one of the finest specimens of the veining of this beautiful wood and a lady's work-table of muskwood is a very elegant specimen of decorative cabinet work. Cedar is found in various parts of the colony, in the ravines and gorges of the mountains, and on the high table land, generally 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. One of the netV products is the gum of the gress tree (zan- thnrrhata Anstralis). The gum, resin, or balsam, is highly inflammable, yielding in combustion a clear white flame and rich fragrant odour, and may be used in churches in place of frankincense. Jt dies calico a rich narheen colour, is used also in making sealing-wax, and will probably form the basis of a varnish. That worsted work should be sent to the Ex- hibition from the Antipodes is somewhat curious, and the specimen here is in addition so far useful that it gives us a group of the indigenous flowers of the colony. Another manutacture is tweed of a coarse texture, a roll of which of coldnial material, worked by the inmates of Cascade House of Correction, is shown. There are also gloves, socks, shawls, and pottery ware. Another unexpected contribution is organ pipes of the Huon pine wood, bored in the solid with stops. It is considered that being free from joints and glue the tube will be less affectpd by atmospheric changes the wood, too, of the Huon pine is very durable, and when properly seasoned is little likely to be influenced by atmostpheric agencies, or to get out of tune. One of the pipes had a stopper, which on being removed the octave is produced\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthis is a novelty, and the pipe gives a very soft note, well adapted for the treble half of the stop diapason of a chamber organ. Another shows how a pipe of the usual construction may be tuned by a stopper, without injury to its size. Among the new table luxuries is Myletta Australia, called native Tasmanian bread \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdit grows under ground, like the truffle, and is eaten in a half roasted state it has also been used in soup and puddings. Necklaces, of Australian shells, possess a brilliant pearly lustre, which is disclosed on removing the cuticle-this is effected by soaking the shells in vinegar, and using friction. Manna is also produced in abundance, from the white gum tree its properties are similar to those of the manna of the druggist. Honey, bees-wax, jams, and preserved fruits, hams and pickles, with a variety of other native productions, are also displayed. A model of a wooden bridge actoss the river Derwent, at Bridgwater, with a span of 250 feet, is a very creditable specimen of engineering the books printed and boiund, the leather and all the materials of colonial manu- facture, and gilt and lettered with gold leaf manufactured from California gold, show that the art of printing, which has re- volutionised the world, has already found a home in these remote islands of the southern ocean. We have also among the miscellaneous part of the collection, cases of Australian insects and birds well preserved canes and walking-sticks handsomely carved, and made out of the os innominata of the whale sets of ladies' tortoiseshell combs, not very well finished boots made of kangaroo skin, and fit for a Van Dlemen s Land exquisite; and an infinite variety of others matters, which are more or less original and curious. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bc GREAT EXHIBITION AND THE ROYAL DOCKYARDS. -The Admiralty have issued orders to the dockyards to the effect that the ofifcers visiting the Great Exhibition are expec- ted to report to their respective superintendents any new invention m machinery, or improvements in articles in general use, tools, &c., that may attract their attention, or anything that may strike them as useful and advantageous to the public service.- United Service Gazette. One of the machine-made barrels, of good stout build, may be seen in this department: it is said to have been made in five minutes by. the patentee, Mr. W. Wild, of Salford. The agitation for the revision of the constitution in France is daily assuming a more formidable shape. The number of important places which have already petitioned the Assem- bly is very great, and promises to be far greater before long. At present the contest is mainly between Legitimists and the abettors of the present Government, the grosser factions lying quietly by and waiting their turn. The Club of the Rue des Pyramides, which counts amongst its members M. de Broglie and M. Montalembert, has adopted a resolution which urges a full revision of the Constitution, with a view to restore to the nation the full exercise of its sovereignty.\" This has always been the cant of the party; universal sove- reignty was the watchword of the Gazette du France all through the reign of Louis Philippe. The Legitimists count upon French restlessness, love of change, and uneasiness in their present position. The Red Republicans are doing the same thing, with tolerably equal chances. Meanwhile, the Chambers debate social questions with a violence and clamour which the Socialists themselves will scarcely be able to sur- pass when it comes to their turn. GERMANY. I In Germany everything is quiet, and it would seem as if everything was forgotten. The King of Prussia had returned from the Warsaw conference, ready primed-, for another. It is said he is preparing to join the Emperor of Austria at Cracow. These conferences are somewhat more amusing to the parties concerned than the congresses, and lead to about the same results-just nothing at all. PORTUGAL. I The Portuguese Ministry has been formed, under Sal- danha's presidency. The men are all Radicals, of no high standing, but sufficiently respectable. Like all successful revolutionists, they will have to give very questionable re- wards to their adherents, and, as Radicals, the first step they will have to take will be to assume unconstitutional power, as the Cortes is to be dissolved, and the business of the country cannot be carried on without. Dictators this year-levellers the next\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdsuch is the office of the Ministry of the Due de Saldanha. By decree of the 21st of May the Queen of Portugal dis- solved the Chamber of Deputies, and convoked the Cortes for the 15th of September, for the purpose of the revision of the Constitution. MORALITY IN SPAIN.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA dark-looking affair that has just been made public shows how fearfully. rotten is the social regime presided over by Queen Christina and the priests. An ex-Minister of the Crown and ex-Ambassador,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwhose long- nourished feelings of revenge for wrongs formerly experien- ced at the hands of the Pope's Nuncio, who crossed his love at a certain Court, prompted him to be ever on the alert in respect to gentlemen of that cloth visiting his house,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda few days ago, detected his better half in an amorous intrigue with a reverend gentleman holding a high clerical appoint- ment. The latter, on finding himself at the point of being run through by the husband's dagger, fired a pistol. This missed its aim, and the result was that the clergyman was conveyed to his own home in a very dangerous state. The wound proved mortal, and he wax buried within twenty-four hours. Suspicions were immediately after entertained as to the cause of death, and his body was ordered to be dug up again by the Patriarch's orders-a private investigation was the consequence, but the corpse was once more consigned to the earth by his Excellency's directions considering, no doubt, that it was better for the reputation of the Church not to stir in the matter. M. Aurioles, one of the district magis- trates, has commenced preliminary proceedings, but meets with obstinate resistance, to the investigation of the body, on the part of the clerical authorities, and he has verbally com- plained to the Court of the Audiencia. The murdered cler- gyman is reported to be a very near and dear relative to the highest church dignitary in Spain! The murderer\" is still to be seen driving about in his carriage ITALY. tj The distracted state of the city of Rome is confirmed by accounts from all quarter. The French soldiers appear t,o be rendering an unwilling service, and are suffering continual irritations from the populace, who appear to be full of mis- chief. The renewal of the debates in England on the Eccle- siastical Titles Bill induces the correspondent of the Times to send the following account of a recent interview between the Pope and an English Protestant, Lieut.-Colonel Curtis, of the Indian Staff, stopping at Rome on his way to England. The interview appears to have arisen from a desire on the part of his Holiness to personally thank the Colonel for ser- vices rendered to, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Agra:- The hour for the interview specified in the major-domo's letter was seven P.M., at which time Colonel Curtis presented himself at the Vatican, and in a few minutes was ushered into the presence of Pio Nono. The interview was entirely private, his Holiness and the Colonel being the sole occupants of the apartment. The Pope received his guest most gra- ciously and simply, the ceremony of kissing the Papal sHpper\" being entirely dispensed with, intimating that he had sent for him to thank him in person for kindness shown to the Indian mission, about which and generally he asked many questions. His Holiness then began, doubtless to his visitor's great astonishment, to speak fully and-unreservedly about his differences with England, justifying what he had done, earnestly disclaiming any intention of offending the English sovereign or nation, and expressing his anxious hope (his precise words were spero sineeramente) that the shadow (V ombre) which interposed between the two Go- vernments might speedily be dissipated. Colonel Curtis left, the Vatican impressed with admiration of his Holiness's urbane manner and unaffectedly dignified demeanour. A few days afterwards his Holiness sent, the Colonel a very beautiful medallion,-executed by M. Girometti, bearing on one side an admirable likeness of Pio Nono, and on the other a representation of the two colossal statues of St. Peter and St. Paul, placed in front of St. Peter's Church at the coitir mencement of the present pontificate. The medallion was enclosed in a red morocco case bearing the Papal arms im- pressed on it in gold.\" If this tale be true, it would seem that the Pope is kept very ill-informed of what his officials have been doing here. At Rome the feeling of hostility between the French and Roman soldiers has lately manifested itself in open and deadly quarrels. General Gemeau has ordered the inha- bitants of the city to give up all their fire-arms, swords, and poignards, by a day named after which domiciliary visits were to be made, and, every one in whose house any of these weapons were found to be tried by court-martial. Lord Palmerston has addressed a note to the Tuscan Go- vernment with energetic remonstrances upon the expulsion from Tuscany of Mr. Pakenham, who busied himself with converting Tuscan subjects to Protestantism. This affair is expected to become a serious questioir. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd AMERICA. f I LIVERPOOL, JUNE 1.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBy the Royal mail steam-ship Europa, Captain Lot, we have advioes from New York, direct to the 21st ult.1 tShe brings \u00c2\u00a3116,000 in specie and 113 pas- sengers. By the El Dorado, arrived at New York, we have advices from California to the 1.5th of April. The steam-ships Pa- nama and Isthmus left San Francisco on the 15th with nearly 2,000,000 dollars in gold dust on freight, the former aniving at Panama on the 2d ult. The mines generally were doing well, in both the northern and southern districts. Rain had fallen in great abundance, and large; amounts of gold were being taken out from the dirt thrown up during the dry season. There had been more Lynching at the mines. Accounts were daily arriving of new discoveries of auri- ferous mines in different parts of the country. The weather had been good, and the country was healthy. Letters from San Francisco relative to the money-market state that it does not present any feature of importance since ,our last notice. Rates of interest are firmly high,, and there is the same difficulty in money accomodation. t Some excitement had lately prevailed there on the sub- ject of private coin, of which the currency in circulatiou principally consists. On examination and settling by the United states aSsayer, this has been found deficient in value from I to 10 per cent.; in consequence of which all private issue of coin, with the exception of Moffat and Co.'s, who redeem theirs at par, and have ceased further issue, was re- fused to be received by bankers, &cM unless at fitting discount. Ci Exchange on the Atlantic States was 2 per cent. premium for sight; bills on England 48 per dollar. France, Ham- burgh, Valparaiso, and Mexico beat a proportionate rate. The Southern Rights convention at Charleston, had con- cluded its sittings- The resolutions were significant of the secession of the South from the North. From Toronto we have intelligence to the 20th ult. Par- liament assembled on that day. The Governor stated in his speech that the revenues from customs and canals, were in. creasing, and that the change in the imperial navigation laws had increased foreign shipping on the Canadian.ports.. From Honolulu (Sa!1dwich Islands) we have advices to the 16th, of Marth, showing an exasperated condition of the quarrel with the French authorities. The latter continue to demand the repeal of the duty on wine&& brandies, which was the original cause of the misunderstanding.. In connexion with this they claim a seatin the Cabinet of King Kanaha- maha, a sharing of the funds voted by the Government to the' support of religion between the French and American mis- sionaries, and the use of the French language in all the official correspondence between the two Governments. In case of non-compliance with these demands by the 20th of March, the French threaten to seize the fortress and blockade the port. The Government protested against the imposition and declared that if attacked they would appeal to the pro- tection of the American flag. SPRINGS IN CALIFORNIA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA correspondent writing from San Francisco, says that a curious discovery has lately been made in one of the inland chains of mountains in Nappa, a place about seventy miles from San Francisco. A party started from Benicia upon an exploring expedition, and when within a short distance of a mountain, heard a tremen- dous roaring and hissing, which they found to proceed from steam issuing from a number of apertures in the mountain's sides, and sounding\" like a great number of steamboats 'blowing off. -The geological formation of the country was extraordinary. In one spot was a spring bubbling. up water so hot as to scald the hand, while not far off another discharged an ice-cold stream. Mineral springs of ,all kinds abounded,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdsulphur, alum, carbonated and chalybeate. A piece of wood placed in one of the springs was soon petrified. A qkiairtity of lignite way-also found. Minerals of many kinds were picked up in the vicinity the whole face of the country was covered with sulphur, and. the party could see I the process of the formation of limestone going on in the mountain before their eyes. They also found a mountain of salt at a little distance. THE OVERLAND MAIL. I Ad vices have reached, via Marsailles, to the following datesCalcutta, April 23; Bombay, May 3; China, March, 30. No political event of importance had occured since the date of the last mail; but the trial and acquittal of the na- tive army-contractor, Lalla Jottu, Pirsand, on a charge of fraud, seems to have caused much discussion, and an almost general expression of disapproval of the prosecution. The Governor-General was at Sealkote on the 15th of April and was looked for at Simla shortly. Sir W. Gomm was already at the latter station. Lord Falkland had arrived in Bombay from the Mahabelushwar Hills, and preparations were in progress for sending troops to the Cape, which it was thought would be required. The Punjaub remains tranquil, but the Peshwaur country continues to be the scene of petty disturbances and rob- beries. A new steamer, the Zenobia, had been launched at Bom- bay for the East India Company, to ply between Suez and that port. Another ship had been burnt at Kedgeree. The vessel was loaded with 3.50 Coolie emigrants, bound for the Mauri- tius and all, save the pilot, captain, chief mate, and half of the crew, with a very few of the Coolies, were destroyed in the flames or by drowning. The Bombay government have determined upon opening up the river traffic on the Indus, by carrying passengers and goods at reasonable charges up and down that stream. The Falkland iron steamer, recently launched, has left for the Indus, and another boat will shortly follow. Deposits, if not beds, of coal have been found in thealabagh district, serviceable for steam purposes. It appears that cholera has broken out amongst the pri- soners at Kurrachee. Another case of military banking jobbing has been brought to light in connection with the North Western and Delhi Banks. The party inculpated is Colonel Ponsonby,. late chairman of the former bank. The Indian papers mention the death of Lieutenant J. F. Johnston, of the 3d Madras Cavalry, who was shot by his groom whilst sitting at dinner, at Jaulbah. The Calcutta Englishman copies the following from a Sydney paper of February 8th The Brothers has made a very quick run from Honolulu of 29 days, which is one of the quickest passages on record. Captain Stavers states, that the day prior to his departure, the British Consul had re- ceived intellignce of two vessels wrecked in St. George's Sound, supposed to be Sir John Fianklin's, and that two of her Majesty's brigs were despatched to ascertain the truth of the assertion.\"", "word": "5", "description": "\u2026 coin, with the exception of Moffat and Co.'s, who redeem theirs at par, and have ceased further issue, was re- fused to be received by bankers, &cM; unless at fitting discount.

INSTINCT IN THE SALMON.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLoch-Shin, a \"ieco of water about twenty-oile miles by fourteen, si- tuate ill tiic heart, of the Sutherland mountains, is the immediate feeder of the rher Shin, noted for its salmon fccundity. The loch itself has four feeders, middling sized rivers, via., the Terry, Flack, Garyie, nnd Curry, in which,, previously to the year 1M3H, not n salmon was ever seen, though mauy were in the habit of entering the loch or take. Although salmon were frequently seen going into Loch-Shin in great numbers and leaping iu it waters, not one had been caught either by Hy-fishing or trolling in the loch, until last year (1810.

How SHOULD GIRLS BK EBCCATKUI\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt has long been a question very difficult to decide whether it is best to educate girls at home or send them to school. \"\u00c3\u00afth regard to boys, there seems little doubt but that school education is the best; as it is generally found that boys brought up at home are not so fitted to make their way in the world as those who have been educated ill a school. \"\u00c3\u00afth girls, however, the case is somewhat different. The special dut). of woman is to make home comfortable and though In many cases women are forced to struggle with the world, it is not because it is their province to do so, but from preuliar cireulllstaners that oblige tlieni for a time to step out of the proper sphere. As it is the province of a woman to shine at honY, it seems most natural to give girls a home education. Schools are said to fostqr the evil passions of hatred and eny). to harden the character, and to engender selfishness. All this is uncongenial to the feminine cliaracte which should be loving, gentle, and devoted. Why, then, should not all girls be kepi at home and exposed only to home selfish- lIess These are questions which it is natural to ask, and difficult to answer in the iiegatiie and yet there are Inany situations iu which it is certainly best to send girls to school. As for example, where there iH ft large family, and the younger children interfere with the education of the elder ones; or when a widower iiiiii-i-ied again, and the claims of a second family cause the children of the first to be somewhat neglected, or, in the opposite ease, where a child at home is ill danger of being too much petted. When, for instance, a girl happens to be an only child, it is scarcely possible to educate her pro- perly at home. It is so difficult to help spoiling an ollly child 1 Such children from liying principally with grown people are generally very amusing, for they talk like the persons they haye lived with, and it appears so droll to hear a little creature, a mere hahy ill appearance, talk ii k, woman, that we are apt to attribute that to clever- ness in the individual, which is in fact only the result of circumstances. The child, however, is of course not aware of the reason why all she sav. i..0 much ndmired ami she can hardly fail to form overweening opinions of her own cleverness, particularly when she finds that she is an object of importance, not only to her own family, but to till persons who visit at the house for, of course, all who wish to please the parents take every opportunity to praise their pet child, At school, however, the neg- lected child and the spoiled child both filitl their real Icrel; and the latter is removed from the dangerous pinnacle on which all,! has been elevated. A school is a little world; and its trials are sometimes as hard to bear as those of the real world. When I speak of home edu- cation, I do not mean that children should be educated by their mothers; for, as I before observed, I do not think that mothers can teach their children so well as those who have made teaching a study. Mere book learning and accomplishments are best taught by masters of the dif- ferent arts and sciences. There cannot be a greater mistake than to hire a governess who is to leach several languages, \u00c2\u00a1.lusie,:allll drawing, in addition to the ordi- nary branches of education. If the governess can culti- vate thfe mind and manners, and teach what is required for a 801U\u00c3\ufffd English education, accomplishments, al lea.1 after the tirst rudiments have been acquired, are best left to the care of masters. No accomplishment should ever be taught, unless there is a natural taste for it for it is a fearful :misa\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a1plieat\u00c3\ufffdon of time and reason to attempt to force irtusicon a child who has no car for melody, or drawing on one who has no eNe for form or colour. Education should assist nature, and not striv@ against her; atld accomplishments should always be considered of secondary importance to the cultivation of the heart and miiid.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMrs. Loudon's Ladies' Companion.

Presently they appeared on the opposite bank, headcd by an old g?,y chieftai and officered like so many soldiers. They were, as HaOlI had stated, of the comadr??a or ring-tail tribe. Oue-a aide-dc-camp, or hi?f pioneer, perhaps-ran up upon a projecting rock, and, after looking across the stream, as if calculating the distance, scampered back, and appeared to communicate with the leader. This produced a movement in the troop. Commands were issued, and fatigue parties were detailed, and marched to the front. Meanwhile several of the eomadrejas-engineers, no doubt-ran along the bank, exarniuiug the trees on both sides of the arroyo. At length they all collected around it. tall cotton-wooil, that grew over the narrowest part of the stream, and 20 or 30 of them scampered up its trunk. On reaching a high point, the foremost-a strong fellow-ran out upon a limb, nnd, taking 8c\\,e.,1\\ turns of his tail arou.ulit, slipped off, and hllng head down- wards. The next on the limb, also a stout one, climbed down the body o, the first, and whipping his tail tightly round the neck and forearm of the latter, dropped off in his turn, and hjng head down. The third repeated this inanseuvie upon the second, and the fourth upon the third, an,1 so c n, until the last one upon the string rested his fore, paws upon the ground. The living chain now commented swinging backwards and forwards, like the pen,lullllll of a clock. The motion was slight at first, but grailuallt increased, the lowermost monkey striking his hands vi )(oll\u00c3\ufffdY on ?ie earth as he passed the tangent of the o?3ei lati??g curve. Several others upon the limbs above aided the movement. This continued until the monkey tit the end of the chain was thrown among the bI, of a tree upon the opposite bank. Here, after two or three vibrations, he clutched a imb, and held fast. This mo ement was executed d,.i?l,, just at the culmi- nating p iut of the oscillation, in order to save the inter- mediate ;linb from the violence of a too sudden jerk! The chain was now fast at both ends, forming a complete suspension bridge, over which the whole troop, to the number of four or five hundred, passed with the rapidity of thought. It was one of the most comical sights I ever beheld, to witness the quizzical expression of coun- tenance lilong that living chain 1 The troop was now on the other side, but how were the animals forming the bridge to get themselves over 1 This was the question that suggested itself. Manifestly, by number one letting go his tail. Illlt then the point d'appui on the other side was much lower down, and number one, with half-a-dozen of his neighbours, would be dashed against the opposite bank, or soused into the water. Here, then, was a problem, and we waited with some curiosity for its solu- tion. It was soon solved. A monkey was now seen attaching his tail to the lowest on the bridge, another girded him in a similar manner, and another, and so oil, until a dozen more were added to the string. These last were all powerful fellows and, running up to a high limb, they lifted the bridge into a position almost horizontal. Then a scream from the last monkey of the new for- tion warned the tail end that all was ready; and the next moment the whole chain was swung over, and landed safely oil the opposite bank. The lowermost links now dropped otf like a melting candle, while the higher ones leaped to the branches anil came down by the trunk. The whole troop then scampered off into the chapparal and disappeared\\~Capt. IteitTs Adventures in Southern Mexico. Y-!

The women of Judca believed in the Saviour, and assisted and soothed him under affliction. A woman of Bethany poured on his head precious ointment, which she kept in a \"ase of alabaster. The sinner anointed his feet with perfumed oil, and wiped them with her hair, Chiist oil his part, extended mercy to the Jewesses.

Is this so ? or is it not, on the contrary, an admitted fact that throughout the British empire the poor are year by year growing poorer, and less able to obtain the conve- niences of life which, year by year, are multiplying for the actual or supposed improvement and delectation of those who can atl'ord to pay for them ? share have the poor in all the c. improvements\" of which the well- to-do in the world are so proud 1- Need aa l oppression ata ing ia their eyes- U.. their back b..g, ragged miaery; T g. word ii? uct their m.od, nor the world 9 law. Why do not political philosophers and commonwealth patriots bestir themselves to make the general lot of the great multitude morc comfortable ? But they do, some one will say. They have given the multitude cheap bread. rrhat I deny, They have made more bread ob- tainable for less monoy but, until something be done to give the multitude the means of purchasing even at the cheaper rate, the gift of cheap bread is worse than no gift, for it is a mockery. It is all very well for men high in office, with fixed sums of no small amount coming ill every (juarter-day, or for some voluble patriots who live upon the interest of a large capital, raised by subscrip- tion, to dwell upon the advantage of a cheap loaf. Of course they are not conscious of being actuated by any motive but that of carrying pure political science into practical effect; but they may unconsciously be biassed by the particular circumstances which surround the.. But if fchey were producers of articles for domestic use, as the great mass of the people are, they would find that a low price for such productions was no advantage and that nothing is really cheap, while the attainment of the means of purchase, even at the cheapest rate, is extremely difficult. The policy which makes things cheap is an excellent policy for those whose fortunes are acquired but the)' who have to live upon the reward of labour, prosper most when the reward of labour is high. It is clear, however, that if labour be not cheap, the products of labour cannot b- cheap. If labourers have employ- ment at good wages, the commodities resulting from their labour must bear a proportionate price. If legisla- tors wish to benefit the great mass of the people, they must look, not to making things cheap, which is for the benefit of the rich, but to the creating and preserving a demand for home labour, which is assuredly for the be- nefit of the multitude. There never was a more fatal mistake than the assumption that cheapness, arising from the employment of foreign labourers to do that which unemployed home labourers might do, is, or can be, a benefit to the mass of the people. Whatever you can get from the labour of the people at home, do get it\" until they are all employed. That is the golden rule. When all the home I b our is \"n\"' ased, then it is time enough to go abroad for help. 41?i. may soon be per- ceived by politicians in whom love of their country and of the people is the predominant feeling. They in whom the love of money swallows up every better and more patriotic sentiment, will leave the home-labourer unem- ployed and destitute, while they seek abroad for what they want at a lower penny. This is \u00c2\u00bb mean and avari- cious policy, and cannot come to good.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdDublin Univer- sity Magazine. LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S STATESMANSHIP AND LOGIC. -Here we have the acknowledgment, quite unreserv- edly m^de, that expediency and not justice is the p?inci- pIe recognised by Her Majesty's Government. What Eord John Russell said resolves itself clearly into this: If you, who represent the agricultural, colonial, and other interests, had thought fit to make a bargain with us in 1841, we, in return for your support, would have insured you a certain amount of protection. I think you were fools not to have done so; but as you did not, you must even take the consequences.\" We should like very much to know upon what principle of ethics this singular declaration can be defended. To us it ap- pears at utter variance with honesty, fair-dealing, and hononr. If, as the Free-traders say, the continuance of protection was a manifest wrong to the industrious classes of the community, what right could Lord John Rusaell have bad to effect any manner of compromise? From every government, whatever be its constitution, we are entitled to expect clear and uninfluenced justice. We know of no rule acknowledged in heaven or on earth which, by the most forced construction, can justify Ministers in sacrificing the general interests of the com- munity for the advantage of one particular class, or in making compromises between public right and private monopoly and gain. For ourselves, and those who think with us, we declare emphatically that we never would be parties to any such degrading compromise; that we should feel ourselves dishonoured if we were advocating merely the interests of a class; and that it is because we know that we have justice on our side that we are resolute in our present appeal. To talk now of former lapsed opportunities of compromise, is to use the language of a freebooter. It reminds us forcibly of an incident in the life of the famous outlaw Rob Roy Macgregor, who, when challenged for having driven away a herd of cattle belonging to his neighbour, very coolly replied-' And what for, then, did he not pay me blaci mail q' The cages are perfectly similar. In 1841 no black mail Was tendered in 1850, after the' depredation has been made, we are taunted with not having purchased the favour and the protection of the Whigs! What right, -or?,,yer, we may ask, has Lord John Russell to ?P.At. the interests o'lclasses, and to talk of the agri- culturists and those connected with the colonies as hav- ing taken a distinct and responsible part in the delibera- tions of 1841! Accordin g to the constitutional view, Parliament is the sole tribunal for the settlement of national questions. It is rather too much at the present dYt ?- i,sinuate such a taunt, and to tell the ruined F,.?,r that he has only hi_If to blame, when in all uman probability, the expected negotiator on the other side, who ought to have made terms with the Whigs, was no leas notable a person than Sir Robert Peel! It is difficult to imagine a more detestable aitd dangerous state of affairs, or one more hurtful to the general morality of the country than must ensue if these indi. cated vie*a of the Premier were to pass into general acceptance; and if it were to be nnderstood that indi. viduals, and corporations, and interests, might, en special occasions, effect compromises with the govern- ment, a variance with public justice, with equity, and with honour. We all know what sort of 'cotnprontises' were made by Sir Robert Walpole in the course of last century | and evil indeed will be the day when the ex- ample f set ishall be acted on by a British minister, with thii difference merely, that large and avowed I com- promlse are substituted for private purchas8, Blackwood't J.IIIgazillc.

TOTAL Loss OF THE TORONTO PACKET SICIP.-This packet ship, nearly a thousand tons burthen, which has ac- complished some of t)f most rapid passages perhaps on record, between London and New York, has been totally lost on the Mantanilla reef, near tbe Bahama Islands, in the Florida Gulf stream\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdtbe entrance to the Gulf of Mexico The ship left New Orleans December 31st for \\*ew York and London, with passengers and a valuable freight. Tbe voyage went on prosperously till the ship reached latitude 25 ;>7, longitude 7!) 4o, when a fresh breeze sprung up from S.S.W., and towirds night it increased tel I folJ, blowing with the greatest fury. All sail was wore in, the ship's course being N, K About eight o'clock they were startled oy the ship striking. She did not bring up\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdher helm was put to starboard, and shtt was proceeding through the water at a rate of about five miles an hour, when she again struck very heavily. The crew then found to their astonishment that they w\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd>re amidst breakers, and before they recovered from the second shuck, she struck again and again with redoubled force. Captain Parker, discovering the fearful position they were placed in, ordered his men to cut awjy the masts, which was carried out with the utmost expedi- tion, and fortunately without injury to the passengers, wh ) had rushed up on deck. This step eased the ship for a time to prevent her driving further on to the reef, both anchors were let go, which brought her up. but she c n- tinued thumping on the rocks, and Captain Parker fearing sne wouui break up, had the boats cleared, suopnea WIlli bread and water, and launched. During the ni^ht the ship remained a fixture, and at daybreak the following morning the sounding of the pumps showed that there was 1101e.s than eighteen feet of water in her hold. The weather mo- derating, Captain Parker determined to remain by the wreck as lorig as it was practicable, trusting some vessel I would observe their position, and take them off. All that day, next night, and following day, not a sail bore in sight. Another mournful night was passed-the crew and pas- sengers suffering intetislly-tlie wreck sunk down on the I reef, and the decks, with the exception of the quarterdeck, were completely under water.

Dowager against the Tieasury was decided on Saturday list. The Court held that there was nothing special in the wording of the Act of Parliament granting the late Queen's annuity, and nothing therefore which dis- tinguished the case from the ordinary annuity cases; and about the general laws of such cases there is no reason for raising a doubt. When ann annuity is granted, it is in the power of the draftsman to say that the payments shall be app.irtionahle, or to leave the ca.;e to events, letting tae annuitant run his chance of benefit or loss. In the present case, the est.tte of the annuitant gained by the events the late Queen obtained a quarter's payment for ten days after the K.ng's death, and her representatives lost the quarter's payment for the sixty-three days between the last payment and the day of her death: blending the her estate gained a quarter's payment for a term less than a quarter by nineteen days. Dealing seriatim with the points urged on behalf of the executors, Lord Camobell finally touched with some severity upon the topic of the \"exaftedrank\" of the deceased. \"Wearc at loss to know how this should influence the construction of the language by which pro- vision is made for her. We might as well be told of her exemplary virtues while living, and of her saintlike death, which will ever make her memory cherished with affection and reverence by the English nation. These we are most ready to. acknowledge but we sit here merely as judges to interpret an Act of Parliament; and, according to the just interpretation of this Act cf Parliament, we are all clearly of opinion, that in the evenr which has happened no arrears of annuity can be claimed subsequently to the 30th of Sep- tember, 1849. Under the peculiar circumstances 01 this case, we were willing to have allowed the mandamus to issue, so that there might have been a more solemn argu- ment at the return, and, the question being put on the record, it might have been carried to the House of Lords: but both parties having declared that they should be coa- tented with our opinion, we have only to say that the rule For the mandamus must be discharged\" SPADE HUSBANDRY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMr. Mechi, considering the very highest order of charity to he the employment of the wil ling labourer, has engaged all the unemployed of the neuh- bouring parishes in the digging and breaking up with h- fork and pick axe, to the depth of about twenty inches, h rocky and iron-bound and macadamised subsoil of his light land.

DELIBERATE AND DIABOLICAL MURDER-About a nv.e,r \u00c2\u00b0i \u00c2\u00b0\u00c2\u00bbc'fck on Sunday morning week, a most ^old-blooded murder was committed in a small court near bridge-street, Worksop. It appears that at the time and I a\"ve mentioned, a man of the name of Edward J (Mines, a lab '.irer, and notorious character, went to the louse ot -Jonatiian Brett, a stonemason, with whom lie had a short time been quarrelling abolll cards, both being in liquor, and called him up. Brett, who was alone in the house, and in bed, got up and opened the ch .niber window, but the moment he put his head out he was lived t trom nelow by Jeffries, and received the contents of a gun in the upper part of his forehead, which lore away a portion 01 the scalp and hair and transfixed them to the ceilmg of the chamber. Brett lingered in great agony untit Tuesd'y, when he expired. Jeffries, it appeared, had said to a man whom he met in the street a short time before, that the eceased h.fd been punching him, and that he should do m m*. being apprehended he acknowledged to the omcersthat he had shot the deceased, but said he had only meant to frighten him. An inquest was held on Wed nesuay, ^vhen the jury returned a verdict of Wilful Murder agdinst Jeffries, who was committed to take his trial at the next assizes at Nottingham.

Considerable excitement was felt in consequence of Commodore Martin having returned with his squadron to the Tagus on the 2Gth nit\" and instead of taking up his position within the limits prescribed for foreign ves- sels, he anchored at the spot especially pointed out for the Portuguese navy. Such an unexpected proceeding gave rise to a variety of conjectures, the most alarming of which was that it vvas intended as a demonstration ill support of some British claims, and for which an official warrant had been granted by Lord Palmerston. The s quadron, however, removed to its proper place on the 23th and from the best information that could be obtained there was every reason to believe that Com- modore Martin's transgression of the established regu- lations was entirely accidental, owing to his total igno- rance of their existence. The project of law touching the restriction of the press had passed the Deputies on the 23rd ult., by G8 voters to 16 but it was not ex- pected that it would meet the same favour in the Upper House, unless a fresh batch of Peers were made for the occasion; which it was thought Count Thamar would not fail to do, should circumstances deem such an extreme measure necessary to carry out his object that of crip- pling the free expression of public opinion. The Por- tuguese consular agents in Great Britain are charged with making extortionate demands upon Btitish vessels bound to any of the Portuguese ports.

By these accounts it appears that a very uneasy feeling continues to prevail throughout and con- cerning the Punjaub. 1 ne late assassinations at La- hore and Peshawur, together with reported attempts else- where, have given rise to the impression that the Sikhs, unable to rt- up a fight with us in the open field, are resorting to the system of private assassination.

AITIIMFI* TO BURN DOWN THE SURREY THEATRE. -At a few minutes after 1 o'clock on Monday mornillg the vicinity of the Surrey Theatre, in the Blackfriars- road, was thrjovvn into a state of alarm by the outbreak of a fire in that favourite theatrical establishment. Most fortunately, the firemen connected with the thea- tre, aided by the police, succeeding in confiuing the mischief to the apartment where it had been discovered. It at once cxcited suspicions as to the origin, no light having, it was said, been admitted into the ward-room since the close of the theatrical entertainments on Saturday night last; and an investigation being made, sufficient proof was established to show that it had been wilfully kindled, and no doubt by some party who pos- sessed a perfect knowledgc of the iuteriOl uf the theatre. A basket filied with pieces of canvas, sanitated with oil and turpentine, had been placed in one corner of the ward-room, and its contents fired through a hole in the wall of the building, from the outside.

It was extinguished but shortly after eleven it burst forth again, and proved calamitous. The alarm was raised, and the inhabitants, with the 98th Regiment, under the commaud of Major Lewis, were promptJy on the spot, and praiseworthily exerted them- selves but as many of the adjoining houses had thatched roofs, they were soon in flames from the basement to the roof. Several horses and carts were soon in requisition, and there was promptly a plentiful supply of water to the barrack fire-engine, which was well worked by the soldiers of the 98th. As the wind blew very strong in a south-easterly direction, the fire continued to gain a rapid asectidaricy and notwithstanding the most stre- nuous exertions, it was near four 0 eloek before it was got under, bilt not until 22 cottages were com- pletely destroyed. They were principally occupied by poor persons, the greater portion of whose household effects have been destroyed or damaged. At one time there appeared very little chance of saving any part of the village, but ultimately, by laborious exertions, the fire was checked. Had a gust of wind wafted the fire to the opposite side of the village, no human efforts, in all probability, could have saved the military barracks from the devouring element. Fortnnately there were no lives lost. Mr. John Brereton, the principal dealer in the village, is the greatest sufferer his dwelling house, which is slated, escaped; but his out-offices, with a large quantity of hay, straw, and potatoes, have been totally consumed No portion of the property destroyed was insured. FRIGHTFUL ATTEMPTS AT MUKDEH AND SUICIDE. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdPftr.sroN, SATURDAY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA very painful sensation prevails at the present time throughout the village of Barup and the surrounding district, in consequence of the following tragical occurrence. It appears that a young woman, named Anne Wallwork, residing in a place called Ball Farm, had been living with a man named William Forster, at Cheethain-hill, Manchester, by whom she had one child. From some cause or other she left Forster, and wpnt tu live at thc before named village with her friends. Forster followed her, and tried to persuade her to return with him, and tie would marry her. This she refused, and after the female and the family had partaken of their dinner on Wednesday last, she was left alone with Forster and a little girl, whilst the others went to work in the garden. Between two and three o'clock in the after- noon he sent the girl out to purchase some writing paper, and whilst she was gone he took a razor from his pocket -and swore that he would cut her head off. He then made a most desperate attack upon Wallwork, and tried to cut her throat. The two struggled violently together.but the fellow succeeded in inflicting a fearful wound on one side of the neck, when the girl he had sent out returned, and having screamed, attracted For- ster's attention He then left off his attack upon the poor creature, but the moment he got to the foot of the stairs he cut his own throat. He afterwards ran up stairs, the blood streaming from his wounds, and when he reached the room he threw himself on the bed, and inflicted another gash in his throat. Dr. Tallor was promptly in attendance, and he sewed up the wounds in both ttiroats. The young woman is expected to recover but not the least hope can be entertained that the man will survive. That Forster intended to murder the woman anrl also himself, is clear, for before committing the deed he made a memorandum in his pocket book, stating what amount of money he had, and where. his furniture was to be found. ASSAULT ON AN EDITOR.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdConsiderable sensation has been excited in the county of Cornwall by an assault committed by the late high-sheriff of the county on the editor of the West Eritun. It appears that at the county meeting of the 12th of February, called in favour of agricultural protection, there was only one of the county members present, T. J. A. Robartes, Esq. The other three members were attending their duties in parliament, and sent letters expressing their sentiments on the sub- ject. Two of these letters (from Sir C. Lemon and W H. P. Careiv, Esq.)vvere read in full the other from E. W. Pendarves, Esq., the oldest of the county represen- tatives, was only partially read to the meeting, tiie part suppressed being that in which he commented upon some statements lliilde in the requisition calling the meeting. Mr. Pendarves complained in a letter to the county papers of the discourtesy of the sheriff shown to himself aud his constituents by the suppression of a part of his leti., r it the county meeting. Sir S. T. Spry, the high-sheriff, replied to this in extraordinary terms; the letter was published in one of tiie county papers, and the other (the West Briton) commented on it in severe language. The West Briton appeared on a Thursday evening, and on the next luornin Sir Samuel Spry called at the ofifce with a solicitor. The editor vvas not there, and Sir Samuel and the solicitor went to his residence. Some conversation took place on the subject of the comments in the paper; Sir S. Spry was much excited, and on the editor refusing to withdraw the comments he had made. Sir Samuel raised a short riding-whip which he had brought with him, and struck at the editor. The latter caught his arm and wrenched the whip from him, and a kind of ,scuffling fight ensued between the parties, until the solicitor, recovering from his astonishment, went forwaid and parted them. A bill. of indictment for the assault was preferred at the assize now holding at Bodmin, and a true bill\" was returned on Tuesday. TIIE LAW AND THE QUAKEUS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWhile the Crown Court was sitting, at the Cornwall Assizes, on Monday, there were several Quakers in court with thcir hats on they were requested to remove their hats, but they ob- jected, upon which Mr. Justice Erie addressed them, and said that all spectators in a court must take off their hats, and if they did not so, they must leave the court. One of these gentlemen said lie could assure the learned judge that he did not keep 011 his hat in contempt of the court he was not a spectator, but a prosecutor. NI r. Justice Erie said he perfectly understood that there was 110 intention to pay any disrespect to the court, and lie treated the matter in that way; but why did the gentle- man refuse to take off his hat or allow it to be removed for him ? The gentleman haid it was from a religious scrupie, not to pay respect to man. Mr. Justice Erie Then you had bettn leave the court and if you refuse I must order you to be removed. All the Quakers then left the court. Citri)t:i.i-ry.-At Spilsby, in Lincolnshire, William Martin, aged 85 years has been committed for fourteen days for imposing upon a woman by receiving 10s. for curing her of a complaint. The old fellow was known as a wise man,\" and gave the woman a paper parcel to suspend round her neck. She wore the parcel as directed, but received no benefit from it. The parcel was opened in the presence of the magistrates, w hen in seve- ral folds of the paper were found some pieces of sticks, and a piece of writing paper, on which was written the word Abracadabra,\" the twelve signs of the zodiac, some fractional numbers, and the following lines By Saint Peter and Saint Paul, God is the maker of us all What Hey-aye to me I give to thee, I And that is nought to nobody.\" The Chairman said but for his great age and many infir- mities, the prisoner would have been committed far three months, with hard labour, on the treadmill.

Sir John Macdonald, the Adjutant- General, after a few days' illness. His loss will be much felt in the office which be occupied, the duties of which he performed in the most efficient manner. The colonelcy of the 42nd foot becomes vacant by hts death. The late general was a member of the same branch of the Macdonald family, as the famous Flora Macdonald, to whom he was nearly related, and he possessed two or three remarkable memorials of his kinswoman. He was appointed colonel of the 42nd royal Highlanders at the death of Sir George Murray in 1844, which distinguished regiment has now again be- come vacant DKATH OF THE EARL OF MACCLESFIELD.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThis nobieman died on the 31st ult., at Ensham-hall, Tets- worth, Oxfordshite, at the advanced age of 87. He was son ot the second earl, by the daughter of Sir William Ileathcote, Bart. The deceased was twice married; on each occasion to a member of the untitled classes, and leaves issue by both marriages. Viscount Parker, his successor, is son-in-law to the Marquis of West- minster. THE LATE COLONEL WEARE, K.1L\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdLast week this distinguished officer died (27th ult.) in Hereford- shire, having lately retired from the office of comman- dant of the provisional battalions at Chatham. He en- tered the army as an ensign in the 35th Foot in the year 1801, and the following year served with the British and Russian army in Italy. Lieutenant Weare served in Egypt in 1807, against the Turks, and was present at the second attack on Rosetta, as well as the capture of the enemy's guns and camels on the banks of the Nile, and in the retreat to Alexandria. In 1809 the lieutenant served at the reduction of the islands of Isehia and Prosida, at the taking of the Ionian islands, in that year and 1810, and during the siege of Santa Maura he acted as an engineer officer. Afterwards he proceeded to the Peninsula, and in the campaigns of 1812, 1813, and 1814, was aide-de-camp to Sir John Oswald, who then commanded the 5th division of the army. During these campaigns he was present .in the severe affair at Villa Muriel, in the retreat from Burgos, the advance of 1813, affair of Osma, the battle of Vit- toria, both assaults and sieges of San Sebastian, battle of Nivelle, and some of the affairs at the Mayor's house on the Bayouue road. The late Colonel Weare had received the war medal and three clasps for his services at Vittoria, St. Sebastian, and Nivelle. In 1830 he was nominated a Knight of the Hanoverian Guelphic Order and appointed Major of the Provisional Battalion; in 1838 he was appointed Lieut.-Colonel of the battalion, and from that time till the present held the \"ppointment of commandant. He was also one of the aides-de-camp to the Queen. DR, WISEMAN'S SERMON ON THE CASE OF GOR- 11 AM v. Ex ET E It. -The following may be taken as the Roman Catholic view of the present ecclesiastical crisis: Never since this poor country was robbed of its faith to legalise the adultery and incest of Henry VIII., was so glorious a signt beheld as was seen last Sunday in St. George's Catholic Cathedral. The vast hall, crammed to its very corners with a host, ehiejly of Pro- testants, thronging to hear a bishop of God's church test,tilts, t?ii-oi preach on the monstrous farce which the powers of England's temporal chutch has just enacted.

A correspondent speaks of the most won- derful discourse ever delivered; not from the pulpit, but, like St. Paul at Athens, Bishop Wiseman standing erect on the platform at St. George's, before such a multitude as may be truly said was never seen at one time in any church in this country.' Truv and the comparison may be coiltiiiiied for was not our Catholic bishop speaking to those Protestants, in some sort, of a God unknown to them, since their church has left it an un- known manner by what rites they are to approach Him and receive His mercies ? And they felt this For an hour and three quarters Dr. Wiseman poured forth a continuous flood of eloquence, pointed with his unri- valled logic.

THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY ON THE GRACE OF BAPTISM.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIn consequence of the late controversy the Archbishop cf Canterbury (late Bishop of Chester) has deemed it necessary to publish, in the form of an ad- dendum to a work written by himself thirty-five years ago, an exposition of h is views respecting the grace of bap tism. In the concluding portion of these explanatory remarks he says,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" All that consistency requires of a clergyman who denies or doubts the universal efficacy of infant baptism is that he addresses his congregation as partakers of the blessings of the Christian covenant, unless their own sin deprive them of it, or unless the state of their hearts prove that they are not believing in the Saviour whose name they bear, and unless the habit of their Iii-es pi-ones tliit tlicy have 110 part in his silva- tion. They may have been treated as regenerate in the language of the Church, and yet be very far from be- coming such I new creatures' as the true Christian must be. Whether or no we believe that they actually be- come the c,iildi cn of God' when they are charitably pro- nounced as such at their baptism, we must judge of them when they come of age, according to the qualifications by which the children of God are characterised iu Scrip- ture. Their baptism made them unquestionably God's citildren in word and in deed,\" but they are not his children in deed and truth unless they are led by the Spirit of God,\" THE ALD.:RMKN AND THE DOCTRINE OF THAN- SLESTANTIATION.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAlderman Salomons has given no- tice in the Court of Aldermen of a motion,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" That the Town-Clerk do repoit whether the oath against transub- stantiation having been by act of pa; liament repealed, there is any occasion fur administering it amongst those taken in the Court of Aldermen.\" Alderman Farebro- ther has no objection to the consideration of the sub- ject. He certainly does not relish the idea of giving up any long-established custom without being convinced that the abolition of it would not be mischievous. Sir P.

WHAT THE RICH ARE DOING FOII TIIE POOR.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd When we look into the amount of what is given, without a shadow of return, by rich to poor in this country\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdnot counting various services in person rendere d by rich men -its magnitude is astonishing. Setting aside the enor- mous standing provision for sick and infirm (the result of endowments), for educational objects, an Englishman of fortune seldom has his purse out ot his hand. lie pays all sorts of legal demands for the subsistence of the poor in the first place; next, he subscribes to various public charities, also to ploughing-matches, &c. he assists poor dependents supports decayed relations he gives alms 011 the highways; he drops money into the chanty- plate at dinners and after sermons he encloses ifve- pound notes to the police magistrates, as from\" A.

DANGERS OF AsPHALTF.On Monday, Mr. Nunn, farmer, of Kelsall, Herts, suspecting the existence of a leak in his tank, lined with asphalte, descended it, lowering at the same time a lighted candle in a common lantern a small distance in advance of his feet. When he had nearly reached the bottom, he observed a flicker- ing light, similar to the flame of the candle, and in an instant there was an explosion. The inflammable asphalte with which the tank was lined took fire, and the whole interior, with the rapidity of lightning, pre- sented a mass of blazing fire, the flames issuing rapidly from the mouth of the tank. Mr. Nunn rushed up the ladder, and escaped almost miraculously, losing only some of his hair, which was burnt during his passage through the flames. His exterior clothing was for- tunately of stout woollen fabric; had it been of light linen, the consequences might have been truly ap- palling. \"ALL'S WELL THAT EKDS WELL.At Maryle- bone, Charles Jopling, who was charged on the 30th ult. with attempting to administer chloroform to a girl to whom he had been paying his addresses, was brought up for further examination.

A solicitor, who attended on behalf of some of the newly-made bride's relatives, contended that undue influence had been resorted to, to induce her to contract the marriage, and the magistrate remanded the prisoner until Tuesday, but consented to take bail.

Every berth between decks is nicely papered and curtained with the utmost care for the emigrants' comforts, in addition to which Mr. Dobbin has divided the vessel into compartments, by which the married families and the single men and women are kept distinct. The vessel was yesterday visited by the Rev.

In spite of the locality, therefore, it was undeniable that the child was born under the British Flag. BRISTOL SUGAR MARKET, MAY 15.-A better feel- ing respecting sugar has been shown by the trade this week than for some time past, and a fair amount of business has been done at prices that could not be obtained last week. The quantity of West India de- scriptions remaining in first bands is very small but further supplies are immediately looked for.-Bristol Gazette. The mortality of London, and indeed of England generally, shows a gradual annual decrease, whilst, it is well known, the population increases considerably. The rates of premium for Life Insurance have been greatly reduced during the last few years, yet the offices con- tinue as prosperous as formerly. These facts clearly demonstrate that some cause, either unknown or un- heeded, must have produced such favourable results. Amongst these causes, the increased knowledge of ana- tomy, and the many very valuable discoveries in medi- cine, will stand most prominent. The small-pox, that annually carried off thousands, has been successfully combatted by vacoination; and Gout, that used to claim its numerous victims, has been thoroughly vanquished by Blair's Gout and Rheumatic Pills. The following account of violence, and Scandalous conduct at the/Bomerset County Protectionist and Con- servative Association meeting, at their dinner, at the Old Down-Inn, on the 1st of May, 1850, Sir John Cox Hippialey in the chair, is stated to have taken place as per Bath and Cheltenham (Jatette (a Tory paper) of the 8th of May, 1850: -11 After the usual toasts, Mr. W. A. Green stood up for the purpose of proposing the healths of Mr, Miles and Mr. Pinney. A burst of disapproba- tion from every quarter of the meeting showed that there was no probability of Mr. Green's proposition being en- tertained and after considerable confusion, Mr. H. Blandford, who sat on the side of the room immediately opposite Mr. Green, rose from his seat, mounted the form, strode across the four tables which intervened between him and Mr. Green, seized him by the collar of his coat, and, with the assistance of others, ejected him from the room, amidst the cheers of the meeting.\" Query, What sort of a man must the chairman be ? Who is this H. Blandford ? Neither Mr. Miles or Pinney were present. COMMISSION OF LUNACY.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn Friday the 10th inst., a commission in the nature of a writ de lunatico inqui- rendo was-opened at South Petherton, in the county of Somerset, before Mr. Barlow, one of the Masters in Lunacy, to inquire into the state of mind of a gentle- man named Sealy Bridge. Mr. Nicholas (of the Chancery bar) appeared in support of the commission on behalf of the heir-at-law, and the next of kin was represented by Mr. Leach, solicitor of Yeovil. The unfortunate gen- tleman who was the subject of the inquiry is possessed of considerable landed property in Petherton and its neighbourhood, and has been distinguished for several years as one of the boldest & most enthusiastic huntsmen in that part of the country. A great deal of evidence was Rone into, from which it appeared that in the month of July last, Mr. Bridge was seized with a severe illness, and that from that time his mind had been more or less affected. He was examined by several of the jurors, but seemed not to comprehend the nature of the ques- tions that were put to him. After a short consultaiiou the jury returned a verdict that Mr. Bridge was of un- sound mind, and had been so since the 15th of July, 1819. Messrs. Langley and Gibbon were the solicitors to the commission. THE CHINESE JUNK.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdA very curiou-s spectacle took place on Tuesday upon the Thames, and one which will long be remembered by thousands who- witnessed then the first Chinese ship which ever floated Oil that river. The enterprising owners of this gfe-at fcariosity having decided upon bringing her from her old: mooring, in the Ea$t India Docks to a point more easy of access to the visitors, appointed Tuesday for the attempt, and we are glad to say that their exertions were crowned with complete success. The junk left. Blackwall, towed by steamers, at seven, A.M., with colours, flying and bands playing, amidst the cheers of the assembled spec- tators, and passed through the Pool in fine style, reach- ing London Bridge about nine, when, after a short delay, she again went ahead, and shot through the bridge most gallantly, and after passing through South- wark and Blackfriars Bridges, came to the moorings laid down for her off the Temple Gardens, and was greeted with the discharge of artillery and the cheers of thousands. Later in the day she was warped into the dock prepared to receive her. We think great praise is due to Captain Shelburne for his judgment in bringing this immense structure through the arches of the various bridges, with only a few inches clear. When it became known that the junk was lying in the river, and the day being remarkably fine, the small cheap river steamers soon became crowded by those anxious to catch a glance of the Chinaman before she entered her new berth. Two SOLDIERS DRUMMED OUT.-Two of the Cold- stream Guards, nam\"d respectively Whittle and Abbott, were on Tuesday drummed out of her Majesty's service in the parade-ground, in front of the Wellington Bar. racks, Charing-cross. They had been guilty of most disgraceful conduct, and had been previously publicly whipped. The whole of the men forming the regiment were marched out upon the ground, when the two de- linquents, with ropes fastened around their necks, were pulled out, and they were then dragged round the ground, the band at the time playing the Rogue's March.\" After undergoing this humiliating spectacle, the two fellows were turned out of the barracks, and the gates were immediately closed upon them. Upon reaching the street they were greeted with the yells of the populace. During the latter part of the evening one of the men was locked up for assaulting a police-con- stable of the F division, whom he mistook for one of the officers who gave evidence against him and his comrade. METROPOLITAN INTERMENTS BELL.-On Monday evening a crowded meeting, convened by the Metropo- litan Sanitary Association, was held at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, Strand, in favour of this bill. Lord R. Grosvenor, M.P., filled the chair, and on the plat- form were Lord Ebrington, M.P., Mr. Mackinnon, M.P., Mr. G. Thompson, M.P., Mr. Wyld, M.P., the Rev. Dr. Watlingtou, and many others who have dis- tinguished themselves in the cause of sanitary reform. The Chairman having opened the proceedings in an able speech, Mr. Mackinnon came forward to move the first resolution, but was subjected to annoyances and interruptions of such a nature as rendered his remarks almost inaudible. He observed that undertakers (from whom the interruption appeared to emanate) would not suffer by this bill. It oould Mt be supposed that the Government could consent to turn undertakers, and those who were already in the business would no doubt continue to be employed. If there were nothing else, he should support this measure on account of the pre- sent high charges, so oppressive to the poor that they were often compelled to keep the dead in their houses for three weeks or a month. (A storm of interruption here met the speaker which lasted for some time, the attempts of the chairman, and other gentlemen, to obtain order being wholly ineffectual). The hon. member at length was able to add that it was for the welfare of the community, the health of the great metropolis, and the happiness of the country absolutely requisite that the system of extramural interment should be adopted. The resolution he had to submit was this: That in the opinion of this meeting the present system of burial in the metropolis is prejudicial to health, incompatible with decency and solemnity, demoralizing in its ten- dency, and unnecessarily expensive.\" After a few words from Mr. G. Thompson, who successfully appealed to the meeting to hear the speaker who was to follow:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Lord Ebrington, M. P., presented himself in support of the resolution. It had been calculated that in and around the metropolis about 25,000 persons died annu- ally. AVhat became of their bodies\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwhere were the spaces provided to bury the dead out of sight. ? (A voice, Plenty of cemeteries.\") Yes, but how was the poor man to convey his relations thither ? (Cheers.) From a Parliamentary return of 1843 he found that there were of parochial churchyards about 170 acres of Pro- testant dissenters, 20 acres of private or commercial burial grounds, 13 acres and about half an acre belong- ing to the Roman Catholics. Now, about 110 corpses might be annually put away in an acre, and before the ground was re-opened, those corpses had returned to their parent dust. The average in these burial grounds had been about 191, or nearly double; but in one, St. James', Clerkenwell, there were as many as 3,000 to an acre, and there were ten others with upwards of 1,000 to the acre. The effect on the soil was that it turned black, ditchy, and greasy, offensive to the senses and most prejudicial to the health. Was not this a disgrace to the country and revolting to the feelings of a civilized man ? This was a task which the Government had not undertaken as a chivalrous crusade against public opi- nion, uninvited to it by anybody; but in compliance with almost unanimous public feeling. The principle of bargaining in such matterscas the burial of the dead was most revolting, especially at a time when such bargain- ing had of necessity to be made-, and he denied that under parochial control such arrangements as the Go- vernment proposed could be satisfactorily carried out. Let the details of the bill be discussed as much as they pleased, but let them assert the principle of the bill. Mr. Nodes, who announced himself as an undertaker, after considerable uproar was permitted to address the meeting from the platform. He objected to the term \"unnecessarily expensive\" in the resolution, and denied that funerals as conducted by undertakers were more expensive than was absolutely, necessary. Let the cemetery companies consent to receive the bodies at any hour, and not confine the undertakers to one par- ticular time, and the charges would be considerably re- duced. There was, he contended, nothing in the bill to guarantee that charges hereafter should not be as high as at present. He looked upon the proceedings as a dead set against his profession,\" intended to fatten those who were already fat enough. 1\\-lr. Box, another undertaker, moved an amendment to expunge the ob- jectionable words, insisting that the competition amongst the trade was too great to admit of exorbitant charges. The question was then put, and the resolution was carried by an immense majority, not above thirty hands appearing to be held up for the amendment. Mr. G. Cruicksbank was then announced to move the next resolution, and essayed to speak, but a disturbance that had commenced amongst the crowd, which was svvaying backward and forward at the rear of the meet- ing, prevented his proceeding. Suddenly a rush was made\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe temporary barriers which separated those who had tickets from the great mass were broken down, the reporters' table was upset, and their notes dispersed. All was immediately in the utmost confusion; and though Lord R. Grosvenor manfully maintained his post, it was evident the proceedings could not go on. His Lordship at length intimated as much, and the meeting abruptly terminated. The disgrace attending a disturbance of this nature was greatly enhanced by the circumstance of a large number of ladies being pre- sent immediately in front of the platform, many of whom fainted or suffered in some way or other from the rudeness of the mob. At a very excellent hotel, not a hundred miles from New York, they were one day short of a waiter, when a newly-arrived Hibernian was hastily made to supply the place of a more expert hand. Now, Barney,\" said mine host; mind you serve every man with soup, any how.\" Be dad I'll do the same,\" said the alert Bar- ney. Soup came on the start, and Barney after helping all but one guest, came upon the last one. \"Soup, sir ?\" said Barney. No soup for me,\" said the gent. \"But you must have it,\" said Barney, it is the rules of the house\" D- the house,\" exclaimed the guest, highly exasperated when I don't want soup I won't eat it,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdget along with you.\" Well,\" said Barney with solemnity, \"all I can say is jest this; it's the regulations of the house, and d- the drop else ye'll get till ye finish the soup The traveller gave in, and the soup was gobbled. FaANCB.-Io the National Assembly on Saturday 39 chapters of the Budget of Finance were voted, and the House adjourned at 6 o'clock. The session of the Council-General of Agriculture, Commerce, and Manu- factures was closed on Saturday. Five members of the society called Solidarite Republicaine were sentenced ou Saturday by the Court of Assize at Paris, two to one year's imprisonment, 500 francs fine, and deprivation during five years of their civil rights and three to six month's imprisonment, 300 francs fine, and interdiction of their civil rights during three years. M. de BTiIR lie is named president, and M. Leon Faucher secretary .,t the Commission on the Electoral law. The alleged iirr<\u00c2\u00bbt 01 a number of persous for conspiracy to set tii t. to dir- ferent quarters of Paris, and to seize the Hotel de Viilt is denied on authority. No such conspiracy h..1i uc-en discovered. The proposition of M. Creten for the abro- gation of the law exiling the Bourbons hAS. been rejected by a large majority of the Commission of Parliamentary Initiative. The Napoleon contradicts the rumour published in several papers respecting the intention of transferring the seat of Government to Versailles. The president of the Republic accompanied by General Changarnier, reviewed several regiments of in- fantry and cavalry in the Champ de Mars on Saturday. The Moniteur of Monday publishes a decree of the President of the Republic legulating the mode in which the Superior Council of Public Instruction shall be convoked, in. pursuance of the 84th clause of the organic law on education. It also publishes a decree dismissing four prefects and two sub-prefects. The Mo- niteur also publishes a report from the Minister of War, recommending the restoration of the commander of the corps of firemen of Paris, who was removed at the revo- lution of February. The President of the Republic has restored him by decree. General Castellane arrived at Lyons on the 9th and took possession of his new com- mand. The whole of the troops were drawn up along the quays and streets, so that the General was enabled, to review the garrison on the way to his hotel. The General was well received by the popolace. The autho- rities visited him on the tenth. The Union Repub- licaine of Saintes, which was prosecuted by the Attorney- General for having published a seditious libel, has been acquitted by the jury. ITALY.-The arrest and incarceration of Franzoni, Archbishop of Turin, for publishing a seditious circular, raises in Italy an inquiry long set at rest on this side the Alps, as to whether the STATE is in the CnuM& M the CHURCH in the STATE. AMERICA.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdBy the American steam-ship Atlantic, Captain West, we have advices from New York iOAptfl 27 On the 3rd inst. she experienced an accidtlit ti-. her machinery, which is said to have detained her ap- wards of forty hours. The steam-ship Ohio had Mrin&- at New York, from Chagres, with gold dust to theTthK of 120,000f. She does not bring any later nevre from. California. The British steam-ship New GrUHddd, from the South Pacific coast, had arrived at Patiatna with 65,000f. in gold-dust. We have Jamaica sdviciin to the 19th ult. The weather was not favourable for planting operations, being very dry. The Royal man steam-ship Medway arrived at Mobile on the 19th ,wt., from Vera Cruz, with 500,000f. in gold-dust. A fire had taken place in the city of Mexico, by which pro- perty to the amount of half a million of dollars had been destroyed. The New York Herald, referring to the Nica- ragua treaty, intimates that it lays the foundation of complete revolution in the commerce of the world, and. also sows the seeds of a naval struggle between the Uni- ted States and England which will surpass anything of Un- kind which has ever taken place in the history of the- human race. It refrains, however, from publishing par- ticulars of the treaty. A steam-boat on the Ohio took fire, by which upwards of 100 persons were killed. A shocking occurrence took place a few waeks sinew on the American priaries. Mrs. Ireland and her dxugh- ter, from Illinois, were frozen to death. They we\", ott their way to California, with their husband and father. Conscious that they were dying, they requested him to- save his own life and leave them to their own fate\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand this brave and affectionate man left them accordingly Some months ago, at Fox River, on the prairies, a young man named Green, impelled by a diabolical spirit of evil and cruelty, shot an Indian squaw. Her tribe demanded him, was at first refused, but at length threa- tening the lives of the whole party, the murderer was given up, and the Indians then skinned him alive, before his father, and brother, and friends! He lived four hours after being flayed. Such is an instance of the revenge of savages\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhorrible indeed, but wantonly and most wickedly provoked. THE CHURCH IN CHINA.-The following is an extract from a letter from an Episcopal missionary clergyman at Shanghai But the great event to us was the opening of our large new church, in the very midst of the Chinese city. It was on Sunday last-the first Sun- day in 1850. For hours before the appointed time numbers of people were waiting about the gateways, and when the doors were open the crowd was such that there was great difficulty in getting them seated. Many of our English and American friends were there also, and took their places in one of the side galleries. When 3 o'clock came, the Bishop, Mr. M'Clatchie, and myself, he in his robes and we two in our surplices, went aod- took our seata in the chancel. The Bishop began with the consecration service adapted to the circumsUncesr aud then a young Chinese convert (who is also a candi- date for the ministry) came forward and read aloud petition, stating that one Mr. Appleton, of America. who honoured God, and had heard that the people of of Shanghai worshipped idols, had sent 6,000 dollars to build this house, and the house being now built, he begged that the Bishop would set it apart from all com- mon uses, and consecrate it to the service of the true God. The Bishop then offered the prayers of conse- cration, and banded me the deed, which I read aloud to- all the people to let them know that their building was now dedicated for ever to the service of the one true- God, whose name is Jehovah. The people seemed to be very much struck with the whole of this service, and if you consider that this was done in the midst of a city of 200,000 inhabitants, all hitherto given to idolatry,. and that one of the most frequented shrines or temples was actually within hearing of our voices, you may judge of the striking novelty of the scene. I have no time to dwell at present upon the details of the service \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhow Mr.M'Clatchie read the gospels-how-I preached -how the people crowded round us, and even stood- upon the benches that they might hear and see more completely. We could hardly get the people to disperse \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwe felt that our cup was running over, and were truloi grateful that God had granted so good a beginning to' our glorious undertaking.\" LIQUID MANURE.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThis mode of fertilising is rapidly being adopted in all parts of ,Scotland, but hitherto it has nowhere been applied on so large a scale as at My- remill, in Ayrshire, the estate of a Mr. Kennedy, who seems to be possessed of great skill and enterprise. Hi. mode of applying liquid manure is as fullows \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" The en- tire drainage of the steading (farm-yard and offices) ia carried in the first instance to a small cess-pool, where any sediment it contains settles to the bottom, and the liquid flows into a tank at hand. This tank is forty-eight feet long, fourteen wide, and fifteen deep. The tanks are formed by digging out the earth, building the sides without puddling, as the stiff sub- soil does not require it, and arching over the top. The ^WO are capable of containing 100,000 gaU\u00c3\u00b31}s. I he liqUid manure is pumped by the engine from th/ fim t0 the second tank, where it is diluted with, water, according to its strength and the state of the a is made ready for being discharged upon. he fields, It is obvious that a steady supply of watec IS required for this and the various other purposes-abont the steading. Such has been obtained by bringing it in. pipes from a higher level, at a distance not less than mile. Cast-iron pipes have already been laid down ftw conducting the liquid from the tanks to 350 Scotch a\u00c3\u00b8r\u00c3\u00b8- of land. There are stop-cocks in the centres of the field<\u00c2\u00bb, generally for each 10 acres of land. To these, when ilk, particular field is to be manured, gutta purcha pipep Are attached in lengths of 30 feet, and a hose at the end for discharging the liquid over the held. The operation is be- gun at the centre by describing a circle round the cock. which circle is gradually widened by adding to' the guttill, purcha till the whole field is taken in. Before gutta perchfc came into use, a fgw years ago, such a plan could not have deen adopled. It is the only substance knoMrtt. which combines the essential requisites of strength and;, flexibility. When we saw the process in full play, the jet from. the hose was. discharged to a distance of 120 feet, and the steam-engine, which is of twelve-horse power, was working a thrashing machine at the same time. It fell like a heavy shower of rain over the ground, saturating it in an evenly manner. A man to\" direct the jet so as to attain an equal distribution of tb^ manure, and a boy to assist in moving the pipes, artt all that are required on the field. In this manner the steam engine and force pump will manure ten acres ot land in a day, throwing out from eight to ten tons.ppr acre. There is no danger of the pipes suffering from t< o high pressure, though an obstruction should occur tl1 prevent the efflux of the liquid. A strong cast-iron ap- paratus, of a globular form, connected with the pipes, and an air-tight outside, is placed near the engine. Wilen the pipes are full, and the engine still at work, the liquid is forced towards the globe, and when the pressure comes up to a certain degree of force, the com- pressed air acts on the safety valve of the engine, an the liquid no longer impelled, runs back along a conduit into the tank. It is principally in the distribution ot the manure that Mr. Kennedy is so far in advance of Mr. Huxtable. The plan at Sutton Walworth is tba1 of cisterns, two hundred yards apart, from which tbo liquid is carried in buckets to be thrown by men over the land. Mr. Huxtable should come to see the magni- ficent jet on the Myremill fields it would give him some idea of the aesthetics of farming.\" THE BISHOP OF LONDON'S BILL FOR A COUNCIL OF BISHOPS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdWhen, in the reign of Elizabeth, a si milar demand was made upon the Legislature by Arch- bishop Parker with that which is proposed by hi* Lordship, it was met by this sagacious reply No by the faith of God, we will pass nothing before we know what it is, for that were to make you popestj make you popes who list; for we will make you none.

I Hats are a great nuisance no man out of Bedlam disputes that. They are an absurd rooting for the capita! of the human column\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe noblest member of the human body. In the past history of English costume, we can find no cover for men's heads so egregiously ridiculous that which posterity will see to have been worn by the heroes of 51. In a crowd they are in the way of those behind us if we keep them on, and they probably get smashed if we take them off: we have tr. hold them gingerly, manoeuvre them, have two thoughts for the hat and one thought for ourselves. Tiiey are a source of headaches, and in windy weather they call our attention from all other thoughts, because our minds must then be con- centrated on the hot. We must press it over our brows tightly enough to cause a deep red ring upon the forehead, and that done, we must be on the alert for any puf of wind which may require us to carry up our hands for its preservation because the great surface of a column slenderly supported at its base, renders it very liable to he blown over. The abandonment of hats, without injury to hatters, is a change now gradually taking place. You shake your head. Weli, we will put by that suggestion for a few minutes, and con- I idr what sort of substitute for chimney-pot hats we, in this country, may be expected reasonably to desire. The Greek cap is often pci:ited to as sotiiething picturesque. In as far as its shape accords with the weare's head, and does not carieature the weaver's body, it is very well. It suits the co-tlime and climate of the Greeks, but, I diffidently sub- mit, not the English dress and drizzle. A cap of many co- lours Would not match our sober broad-cloth-dress, and a sober skull-cap, without any brim, would pour the rain that fell on it over our face in wet weather. in England, certain- -ly, the biim is vn c utial p-P, ly, the bidm is an essential portion of a hat we want eaves to the roofing of our heads ;-not monstrous umbteila brims like those of the hats seen in the Tunis department of our Exhibition, but a moderate projection. The Greeks would have put brims to their caps if they had lived under an English sky. Up the White Nile, the Keks are a race of people wearing skull-caps. They coat their hair with the Nile mud, lettiii, it dry in the sun, /) that they seem to go about entirely bald, with earthen skull-caps. If they lived in a rainy country it would not need many showers to inform them that a mud-pie was unpleasant wearing. Everyman to his taste; but nei- ther mu i-caps nor Greek-caps would suit London weather. A simple head covering, a sk-.ill-cap with a brim, would answer the exigencies of our case, in the simplest manner. Such a head covering, was introduced, not many years ago, under the name of wide-awake,\" by hatters. It was made of felt and was meant for garden wear. bach hats hare been King worn by emr rustic population. Who would have sup- posed that hattPTs themselves, i=,)ducin&ri\"wide-awakes,\" began unconsciously to work the hat reform ? Our English ladies, without calling meetin gs of their sex, or creat- ing any stir or agitation, have done what English gentlemen have talked about, have for their own parts done away with hats for their own equestrian wear. Ladies who ride with cylinders upon their heads are now no longer to be seen. They wear the wide-awake they are emancipated they appear in reasonable hats, and never will be seen in cylinders again. Omitting feathers, and such decorations as become the English woman, bu: do not become the iiiin, hati of this form can be adapted to our male costume, and by this change of fashion there accrues no injury to hatters. The change will not be made by public meetings, or by Anti-Hat Associa- tions. It is a change in progress, slowly but surely, follow- ing the currcnt of opinion. The time has arrived when any hatter may perceive the point to which the public taste is tend- ing.\" \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Dickon's Household Words. WISDOM OF. PROVIDENCE IX THE WORLD'S FORMATION. If the world, ad materialists imagine, were originally formed by a fortuitous concourse- of atoms, it was truly a wonderful chance that guided the formation^ Not to speak of animated nature-- of plants, and animals, and men^who are thus sup- posed tog have grown spontaneously from the dust of the earth, every arrangement of the globe's surface bespeaks a designing hand. The very distribution of land and water is remarkably subservient to wise ends in the history of our race. In the course of ages these elements have altered their character in relation to man, yet it is this very change that most strikingly brings out the wisdom of the great Fore- seer. In early times land was the medium of intercommuni- cation now it is water. In early times, water was the bar- rier of nations; now it is their highly. The ocean is a highway formed to man's hand: noiexpense needed in pre- paring it, no tolls exigible for traversing it. No foreignhos- tile countries are there to impede communication no dense populations to choke up the path of emigration. It it pecu- liarly a gift of God's to the later ages of mankind. It long remained a field untrodden, a blessing sealed and the nic- lancholy sound of its waves seemed to early mankind but the voice of mystery and exclusion. But now the mystery has been explored and the blessing read. And how truly it is a blessing, need be told to none who in fancy can look abroad upon the world of waters and behold them lighted up by the sails of countless myriads of ships, wafting from shore to shore the energies of man and the produce of nature. How, without that ever-open sea, cotild the work of emigration go on, or old countries be relieved of their portentous swarms How could nations, choking in their own seats, ever fight their way through nations to the wildernesses and free places of earth Look at the confiuralioll ur the old wodd. Its continents are massed together, to facilitate the diffusion of early mankind. Place one limb of the compass in Cash- mere, and the other will describe its circle through the north- ern capes of Asia and Europe, the western parts of our o%tn islands, Cape Verde, Cape of Good Hope, returning north- wards through thp Peninsula of Kamschatka. Europe fits like a quadrant into Africa and Asia. The Old World would be a circle, but that its south-eastern quarter is broken into the thousand islands of Australasia. Yet circular though its general configuration be, see how the ocean everywhere interlaces with the land, forming an endless extent of sea- board, and affording to advanced civilisation the readiest of all means of intercommunication. Afiriea is an island. Bay indented Europe exhibits a hymen of land and sea; while, through the very centre of the continental masses, the Medi- terranean and Red spas all but unite the waters of the East- ern and Western oceana. That small Mediterranean sea washes the shores of three continents\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAsia, Africa, and Europe glass themselves in its tranquil waters. It lies like the heart of the Old- W mid system; while te \u00c3\ufffdeRn, the Euxine, aiid the seas of Azof and the Caspian, stretch in connected or connectable links into the very centre of the northern continents. A steamer from St. Petersburg may circumnavigate Europe, and regain the heart of Russia by the sea of Azof and the Don. All these-watery barriers, it will be seen, are so circumstanced as not to obstruct the early wanderings and diffusion of the human race, yet served the purpose\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdall important in those days of war and strong antipathits\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdof keeping asunder many diverse nations, of l l-wi,.ie Iland that I preserving peace by isolation. It an all-wise Hand that so guarded the nations in their cradle it was au all-provident Hand that then-Used for isolation an element which, in sub- sequent ages and in altered times, was capable of becoming the best means of bringing into close union the whole family of man. A similar design is evident in the plan of the New World though, less in extent, its variety is also less. Its form is longitudinal; tapering to a waist as it descends from the frozen north, swelling again beneath the torrid zone, and again tapering away to a point on the confines of the Antarc- tic snows. It thus presents the largest possible extent of sea-coast, as if inviting Europe and Africa on the one side, and Asia on the other, to send thither their swarms. Hud- son's Bay is a counterpart of the Baltic; lies in the same iatuuaes, ana is destined to serve a similar purpose (an out- let for the north) as soon as population has grown thicker around its shores. The Gulf of Mexico an4 Carribean Sea- the immense basin of waters lying within Capes Florida and the mouths of the Orinooco, has hollowed out the land, not merely for the sake of adding to America her Elysian isles, but to carry the shipbearing sea into the ceutre of the western continent, and to narrow to sixty miles the passage between the oceans. In the Isthmus of Panama we find repeated the Isthmus of Suez. The peculiar configuration of America, too, by which its dorsal chain of mighty mountains runs close to its western margin, not only leaves its eastern plains open to Europe, from whence its population was to be de- rived, but affords to its internal provinces the inestimable benefit of ready access to the ocean. For its rivers, flowing the whole breadth of the continent, acquire a magnitude un- paralleled in the Old World-forming watery highways, up which the tide flows for hundreds of miles, and floating into the heart of the country the men and produce of distant climes. But there is a Mediterranean iu the New World also. The majestic lakes of Northern America\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe largest in the world, and containing one-half of all the fresh water on the surface of the globe\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdwhich form in the heart of the continent a succession of inland seas, are yet destined to be covered by a myriad sails, and to see spring up around them, as arcuud the Mediterranean of the Old World, mighty, opu- lent, md populous \"at\"Duban Univtriitjf Atofacuu. ? \"C\" \u00ef\u00bf\u00bc f:?

The Marquis of Lansdowne said that whenever any com- plaint was made on the subject to her Majesty's Government by the British residents at Rome, his noble friend the Secre- tary of t'tatc for Foreign Affairs would make an application in their behalf to the Papal Court; but he must say his own firm opinion was, that any request to be allowed to erect a permanent building for the celebration of Protestant worship within the walls of Rome would not be attended with success. The Commons' amendments to the Patent Law Amend- ment Bill were, on the moti.m of Lord Monteagle, and without a division, agreed to be taken into consideration that day month. The bill is consequently lost. His Lordship said, that whatever inconvenience might be felr, their lordships were not responsible for it, and the re- sponsibility must rest with those who had passed the Hill through two stages in one day, and had sent it up to their lordships on the day before the conclusion of the session.\" (Cheers.) a Their Lordships then adjourned. Fit! DAY, AUGUST 8. Christenings and burials all the world over arc attended with some sort of ceremonial. There are countries in which both of these important matters alfunl occasion for a certain festivity and rejoicing, while some barbarous nations are wise enough to deplore the occurrence of each of them. In England the beginning and end of Parliamentary existence for the year is marked by a union of both feelings, the pre- ponderance of each being determined by the feelings of the nation, while it sometimes happens that a blank indifference prevails, which is anything but flattering to the virtues of the deceased or to the anticipated excellence of the newly- born offspring of the people's choice.\" For many years the beginnings and endings of sessional life-the openings and prorogations of Parliament, have been spectacles of a highly popular character and more recently that popularity has increased in consequence of the general affection and re- spect felt by the people for their sovereign. The people are glad to see Parliament open they are glad, alas to see it closed. They have at first the pleasures of hope-at the end they are but too often deprived of the pleasures of memory. As to the noble and hon. members of both houses, it cannot but he supposed they look forward to each event with more or less pleasurable anxiety. After all the daydreams of renown which rose with the haze of some fine September morning on the hills and among the partridges have vanished before the full heat of the lights of the house\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdafter glorious speeches and perorations delivered to the obdurate grouse on some inaccessible crag, or to the skulling salmon in a glassy fiord, conceived in the tinest moments of exulting escape from com- mittee-rooms, and rescued for their crowning success till a crowded house could attest the orator's genius, have perished beneath a \"emint out\" or have obtained the miserable abor- tion of an inaudible in the gallery\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdafter presuming ineffi- ciency has been snubbed, modest self-sufficiency laughed at, young ambition knocked flat on the back benches,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdafter all sorts of hobbies have been ruthlessly mutilated, their legs cut off, their backs broken, their tails snipped, and their eyes put out, no wonder indeed that hon. members should be de- lighted to behold the happy day when the Queen, \"dell er maahind,\" comes to release them from the unkindly atmo- sphere which has blighted the finest fruits of their genius. No wonder, too, after a hard month's shooting, or a few weeks' walking, yachting, riding, or driving, or after some hard tustles with lirogdignag salmon, if they forgot all their misfortunes, if their antagonists are diminished to the most petty dimensions, and quite disenchanted of all terrors by the distance between them, and if they look forward to that vast repertory of forgotten pledges and falsified hopes, next session,\" with fond anticipations of redeeming their lost ground or of gaining the smallest spot of Parliamentary space to stand upon upright before the world. It may fairly be guessed that the prorogation on Friday was not disagrce- ble to many members of either House. It was remarkably fine as a spectacle; it must have been exceedingly welcome as a substantial relief to most of those concerned in the rising of the House. What the results of the session have been it is not for us to say in this place, but we may safely assert that, had it been longer, the little that has been done would have become less. Long discussions would have been elon- gated with no gain to the discussers, the few useful measures that have been passed might have been crippled, and a not very fruitful session might have became a perfect specimen of a legislative Upas. The appearance of the House would remind an habitue of some of those wonderful changes on the stage by which respectable young farmers are at a touch transformed into radiant harlequins, and common-place ladies in love and white muslin sublimated into angelic columbines with magical graces and beauty. The day before it had been as dull-looking as so very handsome a chamber could be,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe Lord Chancellor on the woolsack, and some few gentlemen, in prosaic varieties of costume, nursing the few survivors of the Parliamentary washing-tub into full life. Now it is a splen- did hall, which borrowed rather than lent its splendour, the bright hues that outsh'me and yet blended with the glories of its roof of fretted gold, stained glass, and emblazoned pa- nelling, being reflected from a serried crowd which filled the scarlet benches that generally support the scattered owners of different dim-coloured coats, white and black hats, and sober-coloured pantaloons. On entering the house below the strangers' gallery, about 12 o'clock, one would have seen the whole of the benches in the body of it covered by Peeresses and their friends, with the exception of the front row and cross benches. The galleries usually reserved for the Com- mons were occupied in the same way; and the continuation of them, which is generally used by Peeresses, presented a similar display of rich costumes and fine ornaments, with that large average of good looks for which our countrywomen have so much reason to be thankful. It is said that, in the old times, the house looked better not that any one pre- sumes to disparage the beauty of the interior, or to compare its stained windows, and carvings, and frescoes with the de- corations of the old house, but that many people prefer \"feathers,\" which were worn formerly on these occasions, but which now seem to be disused. The nodding of soft silky ostrich feathers, like the motion of floating snow, was no doubt agreeable to the eye, but the eye, after all, lost more than it gained, inasmuch as those feathers, when worn in a crowded assemblage, too often concealed the features of the wearers. It seems more natural and becoming that our ladies should dress themselves with the aid of flowers and simple ornaments to set off the disposition of the hair, than appear like a regiment of Dahomey Amazons, all covered with the spoils of the ostrich. For some time there was nothing to do but to observe the arrival of the ladies at gallery or bcncli, as there were but two or three Peers present, the Earl of Harrington being among the first present (and soon afterwards Lord Monteagle) in their robes. Now and then a Peeress, or some Peer's friend in distress would be seen after Mr. Pulman or Sir Augustus Clifford, searching in vain for a place amid the thick ranks of implacable W relentless-looking ladies, or implorim* those good-natured officers to effect impossible positions for them. Then came the excitement consequent on the arrival of the members of the various diplomatic corps, and irritat- ing doubts as to the identity of each nation, every one of them seeming to take delight in baffling speculation on this point by a rigid uniformity of dress-blue and gold and white trousers being in great favour. All the ambassadors and attaches were, however, provokingly like each other in attire, except that the Chevalier Bunsen and Mr. Lawrence preserved some distinctive traits, and that the Turkish Em- bassy were noted by their immoveable fez caps. These gen- tlemen occupied the episcopal benches on the right of the throne, and only left one row in front for the bishons which was, however, quite sufficient, for the Bishop of London the Bishop of Norwich, and the Bishop of Ossory were the only prelates present during the early part of the day. It must be admitted they constituted a very distinguished-looking body \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdtheir breasts gleaming with ribands, stars, crosses, and orders, while the younger men were remarkable for variety of beard, trimness of moustache, and (apparent) liveliness of conversation. In the galleries were some Spanish officers, whose uniform was perplexingly like our own, and close to that portion of the left-hand gallery over the throne two Orientals, probably from some portion of Ilindostan, were seated, rich with barbaric pearl and gold, shining resplen- dently as J ung Bahadoor himself in the grand tier of the opera, and surveying the whole scene with true Eastern nonchalance. ?h'?, Peers dropped in by degrees, so did some of the Judges\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdChief Baron Pollock and Mr. Justice Patteson among them \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdall in their robes. The legal mem- bers assembled in a nucleus near the woolsack, and a Master in Chancery, in his black gown and long wig, served as a point of contrast to the bright masses of colour around him. The Lord Chancellor came in about 1 o'clock and after a little talk with those near the foot of the throne, took his seat. Soon after him came in the Duke of Wellington, in the not very imposing uniform of an English field-marshal, with the Marchioness of Douro on his arm, and walked up close to the very end of the house, looking for a place where- in to put his daughter-:n-law; His Grace looked \"remarka- bly well,\" and, often as that statement has been made on similar occasions of late years, it never was better founded, to all appearance, than now. The gentle hum of conversa- tion, the murmuring sound of agitated fans was hushed for a moment as The Earl of Shaftesbury raw to move, in the absence cf the Earl of Harrowby, that an humble address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that Her Majesty might be gra- ciously pleased to direct that a circular should be addressed to the several Ministers of Her Majesty at foreign Courts, and also to the consuls where they discharge diplomatic func- tions, instructing them to report on the facilities which are offered in the several countries in which they reside for the erection of Protestant chapels, and for the formation and regulation of Protestant burial-grounds and also on the laws which prevail in the several countries where the Roman Catholic religion is established, touching the exercise of the Protestant religion. The Marquis of Lansdowne offered no opposition to the motion, but was rather desirous of its success, as it was at once agreed to. A message from the Commons with respect to the amend- ments on several bills was brought iu, and the bills after- wards passed. This comprised the whole of the business, and for some time there was nothing to do but to inspect the nc'.v arrivals or to comment on the aspect of the company. The Peers mustered in tolerable number. On the Government benches were the Marquis of Lansdowne, Karl Grey, and the Mar- quisjof Clanricarde while, for what reason we know not, the Opposition side was much more in request, being selected by the Earl of St. Germans, the Earl of Cardigan, the Karl of Devon, the Earl of Shaftesbury, the Earl of Enniskillen, Lord Monteagle, and many others. A long interval devoted to small talk, and in justice be it said not very loud, as very small talk sometimes is, followed, during which the Peers walked about and chatted with the. ladies, behind them, or to the foreign Ambassadors and Ministers, and the strangers admired the decoration-, of the house, or discussed the sub- jects of the inscrutable stained windows, with their recondite Gothic inscriptions. Presently in swaggered some officers of the Life Guards, whose burnished helmets, cuirasses, scab- bards, and boots framed an additional element in the blaze of foreign uniforms, bullion epaulettes, and sashes, gray silks and ribands, flashing diamond-i and scarlet and ermine, that shone from wall to wall of the house, and from floor to roof, checkered and shot, as it were, with the many rays cast by the sun across it from the coloured windows. They soon retired, however, and the Lord Chamberlain, the Usher and Deputy-Usher of the Black Itod cleared the space before the throne, and showed bv their quick movements that lier Majesty was near at hand. At this moment the house would have furnished a ifne subject for a painter, if any combining the powers of Rubens, Rembrandt, and Wilkie could be found to manage it. The lights were beautiful, the shadows fantastic and effective, \"and through the doors at the throne end could be seen the figures of the beefeaters with partisans and carlet hose, intercepted from the view now and then by the apparition of some courtly dame sweeping along to her place, or by the scarlet robes of a tardy peer, giving one the idea of some old-world scene in the days of Queen Bess, or (with reverence be it spoken) of the excerpt of a well got up stage scene in an old play. At a quarter-past 2 o'clock a sharp flourish of trumpets outside announced the approach of the Queen simultaneously with the dull reverberations of the Park pateraroes. The blast died away through the mystic recesses which Mr. Barry has contrived so ingeniously, siveile(I again, and again fainted away, ere the he all of the llnyal procession wa; visible at the right-hand entrance to the house. A soft breath of folding ft'ns -a quiet hush\" ran through the house, and in marched the Royal heralds, with all their I)ageaiitrv,-tlic Marquis of Lansdowne, bearing the Crown\" on a cushion; the Mar- quis of Winchester, carrying the Cap of Maintenance the Duke of Wellington, carrying the S\u00c3\u00b5vord of State,\" right boldly and uprightly the Lord Chancellor, preceded by the maeebearer and mace; and then the Queen, leaning 1 .a-\" ) of the tram, so as to enarne ner to sit down, inc rrinee took his seat on his chair, outside the canopy, to the left; the Duke of Wellington stood close to Her Majesty, with the Sword of State, on the same side, while the Marquis of Lansdowne, the Duchess of Sutherland, and the Marquis of Winchester stood immediately to the right of the Queen, and behind them the Lord Chancellor. Her Majesty seemed in perfect health, and her dress, which it is quite beyond our powers to describe, was most becoming and regal. At her entrance the whole House rose, but immediately seated itself at her wish. Mr. Pulman, the Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod, was then desired to summon the Commons, Sir Augustus Clif- ford, the Usher of the Black Rod, officiating in the house in the place of the Lord Chamberlain (Lord Willoughbv D'Kresbv.) A pause of some mintites-ni-ach longer, indeed, than usual, on account of the length of the corridor to be traversed between the two houses, and probably, also, be- cause of the new and more dignified arrangement, took place, during which several Peers on the cross-benches seemed watching with great curiosity the reformed mode of approach to the Royal presence on the part of the Commons. The Queen, indeed, did not appear quite indifferent on the Tioint. and, after a few minutes had elansed, smilingly ad- dressed some words to the Duke of Wellington, and laughed at his reply. The Marquis of Lansdowne peeped over the crown as well as he could, to get a sight of the stately march of the Lower House and the gaze of every person present was directed for a time, which probably was not so long as it seemed, to the bar, where at last the Commons took up then- station in most dignified array, four deep in front, and spread- ing out on the flanks, led by Mr. Speaker, the Serjeant-at- Arm, Lord John Russell, Lord Palmerston, Lord Dudley Stuart, itc. It is probable they never yet presented them- selves before royalty with such decorous staidness, and, though Lord John Russell's intrepidity is not to be ques- tioned, it is very doubtful if he would have appeared so well favoured had he been left to the chances of a scramble among the burly Protectionists and Irish members in so long and so narrow a transit. The Speaker, after having made his obeisance to Her Ma- jesty, delivered the usual address at the close of the Session. Several bills were then handed in, and the clerks standing at the table, and facing the throne, announced them in the usual form. One read the title of the bill; the other, after a short pause, turning half round to the Commons at the bar, and informing them in Norman-French, and, we have no doubt, with the genuine accent handed down by tradition in his office, La Heine le vent,\" or So it fait colitille il est desire,\" &c. The Consolidated Fund Appropriation Bill, the Merchant Seamen's Fund Amendment Bill, the Episcopal and Ca- pitular Estates Management Bill, the St. Alban's Railway Commission Bill, the Relief of the Poor Continuance Aid Bill, and the General Board of Health (No. 3) Bill, received the Itoyal assent in this form, and, at the termination of the proceeding, The Lord Chancellor presented Her Majesty with the copy of her speech. The clear, emphatic, and natural manner in which the Queen reads has been to often remarked for us too mention it here. Apart from the silence which would be naturally pre- served on such an occasion, there must be something in the mode of elocution and delivery possessed by Her Majesty which her right trusty and well-beloved cousins\" very often fail to attain, that can enable her to make every word most distinctly audible. It may be said, there is a difference be- tween speaking and reading but we affirm that of all the Eleusinian mysteries practised in the house, the most hope- lessly unintelligible is that which is performed when most noble Lords get up to read a petition. If Mr. Barry could succeed in training half-a-dozen speakers like his Royal Mistress, the acoustic properties of the house would not be so universally ridiculed. Her Majesty's speech was as follows;\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd My Lords and Gentlemen,- I am glad to be able to release you from your attendance in Parliament, and I thank you for the diligence with which you have performed your laborious duties. I continue to maintain the most friendly relations with Foreign Powers. I am happy to be able to congratulate you on the very considerable diminution which has taken place in the African and Brazilian slave trade. The exertions of my squadrons on the coasts of Africa and Brazil, assisted by the vigilance of the cruisers of France and of the United States, and aided by the co-operation of the Brazilian Government, have mainly contributed to this result. Gentlemen of the House of Commons,- I thank you for the readiness with which you have granted the supplies necessary for the service of the year. My Lords and Geittlenien, It is satisfactory, to observe that, notwithstanding very large reductions of taxes, the revenue for the past year con- siderably exceeded the public expenditure for the same period. I am rejoiced to find that you have thereby been enabled to relieve my people from an impost which restricted the en- joyment of light and air in their dwellings. I trust that this enactment, with others to which your attention has been and will be directed, will contribute to the health and com- fort of my subjects. I thank you for the assiduity with which you have ap- plied yourselves to the consideration of a measure framed for the purpose of checking the undue assumption of ecclesiasti- cal titles conferred by a foreign Power. It gives me the highest satisfaction to find that, while repelling unfounded claims, you have maintained inviolate the great principles of religious liberty so happily established among us. The attention you have bestowed on the administration of justice in the courts of law and equity will, I trust, prove beneficial, and lead to further improvements. I have willingly giveniny consent to a bill relating to the administration of the land revenues of the Crown, which will, I hope, conduce to the better management of that de- partment, and at the same time tend to the promotion of works of public utility. \"It has been very gratifying to me, on an occasion which has brought many foreigners to this country, to observe the spirit of kindness and good-will which so generally pre- vailed. It is my anxious desire to promote among nations the cultivation of all those arts which are fostered by peace, and which in their turn contribute to maintain the peace of the world. In closing the present session, it is with feelings of gra- titude to Almighty God that I acknowledge the general spirit of loyalty and willing obedience to the law which ani- mates my people. Such a spirit is the best security at once for the progress and the stability of our fiee and happy insti- tutions.\" The Lord Chancellor, kneeling at the foot of the throne, received back the copy of the speech, and, having been com- manded by Her Majesty, prorogued Parliament in the fol- lowinir terms :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt is Her Majesty's Royal will and pleasure that this Parliament be prorogued till Thursday, the 4th day of September next; and this Parliament is accordingly pro- rogued till Thursday, the 4th day of September next. Her Majesty bowed and rose, the whole of the house rising also the Commons made their bow, and the Royal proces- sion left the house as it had entered, amid the blast of trum- pets and the thunder of cannon.

{"ocr": "r MISCELLANEOUS INTELLIGENCE. M. Thiers, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Lon- don on Thursday, on a visit, it is said, to Louis Philippe. He was in the House of Lords in the evening, and chat- ted with Lords Lansdo-.vne, Brougham, Palmerston (who made'a pop visit to see iiiin), &c. Considerable surprise was excited last week by the rapidity of a passage from St. Petersburg, performed by the Emperor steamer, which arrived at Hull in four days and three-quarters, the common time being about eight days. Twenty-four plants of the famous Stanwick Necta- rine, the property of his Grace the Duke of Northum- berland, were sold by auction, a few days since, for the extraordinary sum of JE16 i 19s. which was, by his grace's orders, handed over for the benefit of the Gar- deners Benevolent Institution. A company has been formed in Boston, with a capital 15,000 dollars, called the New England Matrimonial Agency Company.\" Gentlemen in want of wives and ladies desiring husbands pay three dollars and have their names registered. This done, they are entitled for one year to receive introduction's and other assis- tances from the company. When the Queen is in residence at Windsor Castle there are generally about 115 horses and ponies in the mews, while some twenty more are left at Buckingham Palace. This noble stud, however, falls far short of that of the late Earl of Lonsdale, which, in the palmy days of Cottesmore, numbered two hundred, every one of them with a pricc on.\" The Free Church of Scotland, since the disruption, has raised for its various purposes no less a sum than \u00c2\u00a3 2,171,659; and the contributions to its entire funds during the past year have exceeded those of the previous year by E31,145.. The convention concluded between the Governments of Great Britain.and the United States for the settle- ment of their common interests in Central America, and for the perpetual neutrality of the inter-oceanic line of communication by ship canal or otherwise through the State of Nicaragua, has received the approval of the Senate of the United States. The ratifications will forthwith be exchanged. A paragraph in the Times of Thursday somewhat favourably qualifies one which appeared on a preceding day respecting the health of the ex-king of the French. He remains an invalid, but has so far recovered as to be able to drive out. The officials of the Great Western Railway have raised E200, which sum will be devoted to the purchase of a service of plate for Mr. Seymour Clarke, on his leaving the line. The Independence, American, with flag of Commo. dore Morgan, was en Touts for Gibraltar, whence she is to proceed to Lisbon, to demand a sctilemetit of claims due by Portugal to America. Only twenty-three public acts have been passed in the present session, up to Monday last, commencing on the 31st of January last a period of mnfe than four months. A public meeting was held on Wedni sday, in Sack- ville-street, Piccadilly, for the purpose of raising a fund in honour of the memory of the late Qui en Adelaide, to be applied to the relief of orphan daughters of naval and marine officers. At Ilennison's baths, Bristol, a celebrated diver, last week, jumped from an elevation of eighty feet, with a pair of boots in his hands, which, before rising to the surface of the water, he had pulled on to his feet. Twelve hundred lizards have been imported into Plymouth from Jersey, and are intended for exhibition in that town. They are valued at nearly \u00c2\u00a3300. The Vienna Gazette announces officially that the Government intends to regard the representation of Austrian industry at the London Exhibition of 1S51 as all affair of State. The Pasha of E4 gypt having learned that in England it is the custom to give dinner parties to friends, has consequently ordered every Pasha and Bey to invite the members of his family and his relatives to dinner one day in each week. It would seem, from an article in the Morning Chro- nicle, that the office of poet laureate\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd(with an intima- tion that no poetic tribute need be paid) -has been offered to Mr. Rogers, the venerable author of The Pleasures of Memory,\" but was gracefully declined by him, on the plea of age. We (Dublin Commercial Jouriud) have much pleasure in intimating that we understand that 19O acres of land has been taken for a Niuiol Farm, in connection with the Queen's College, Cork. This is as it should be, and augurs well for the future prosperity of the esta- blishment.

I The arrival of the mail steamer, Great Western, with E247,000 in specie, of which the largrst portions con- sists of gold from California, coupled with the announce- ment that her Majesty's ship, Amphitrite, was expected at Valparaiso, from Mexico, with a further sum of L400,000 for England, has bad a favourable effect this week, in contributing to the growing feeling of commer- cial confidence.

We have so frequently referred to this case that we have nothing new to ia), upon it. The grand error is with those who committed such a princely fortune to such an incompetent recipient. The Gateshead Observer savs that one Mr. David Prince Miller, conjuror, showman,stagrplayer, &c who is now giving an entertainment in the provinces entitled the \"Ups and Downs of Life,\" exposes for profit the tricks to which he and his brethren are occasionally driven for a livelihood Mr. Miller, it seems, travelled in charge of the Bosjesmaus, one of whom was his own son The savages had taught the youth their language, and he then exhibited himself (without detection) as one of their race.\" At a meeting at Gateshead last week, on behalf of the I Exhibition of 1851, a working man named Blagburn showed that there was but the thickness \"f a deal-board between an elephant and common sense. It used to take four-and-twenty horses to drag an elephant up Dean-street. Such a set to the poor beasts had to drag the caravan up the bank until, at last, it struck some man of common sense to take the b\u00c2\u00bbitorn out, and let the elephant walk up himself and then the difficulty all vanished, and the elephant had the advantage of fresh air and exercise into the bargain.\" A writer in Notes and Queries gives an instance of Curry's wit, introduced after a defeat in a conversational contest with Lady Morgan. It was the fashion then for ladies to wear verv short sleeves and Lady Morgan, albeit not a young woman, with true provincial exagge- ration, wore iione-ri mere strap over her shoulders. Curry was walking away from her little coterie, when she called out, Ah come bark Mr. Curry, and ac- knowledge that you are fairly beaten.' At any rate, said he, turning round, I have this consolation, you cannot laugh at ine in your sleeve Crops of every description in the vicinity of Dreux, France, have been destroyed by a hailstorm The hail- stones were as large as pigeon's eggs. At a meeting of magistrates held 'nst week at the Sessions-house, Clerkenwell, a proposition to reduce the wages of the inferior officers in Coldbath-fields Prison was, after a long discussion, rejected by a Urge majority the numbers being, for the motion, 12 against it, 32. The motion with respect to the sitpui ir ofliccrs was postponed. A Scotch paper relates that on Friday evening week a young couple were married at Barrhead, and on the following Sunday morning the husband was suddenly seized with madness, rushed out of the house, and was not discovered until the following day, when he was found wandering in the streets of Glasgow, in a state of mental derangement that rendered it ncceisary to place him in the lunatic asylum. At Lancaster, last week, the wedding festivities of a plasterer's labourer, named Wilson, were unexpectedly terminated by the apprehension of the bride upon the charge of having obtained \u00c2\u00a310 under fahc pretences. The bride has since been committed for trial; but Wil- son has not much reason to regret bo loss, as she has at least one husband already living. In the Court of Queen's Bench, on Wednesday, the Attorney-General obtained the issue of a writ to the Archbishop of Canterbury, to command him to inquire and certify to that court upon the matters wherein the IIJ, 3rd, and 4th issues hid been joined in a certain suit of quarc impedit, in which the Q.neen was plaintiff, and the Bishop of Exeter was the defendant. This was not a rule to show cause, and was <mly mentioned to tho coirt as a matli-i of courtes y to the \u00c2\u00a1;crsons c< n- rernrd loi the \"nt, according to ti\", u.-ojai foi m ol proceeding, would issue ao a uutter of our sc. At the Hull police-court, an Irishwoman refused to take an oath, because she was e?cct?e! This was stated to be a prevalent superstitition among Irish matrons. The authorities of the Stamp Office have issued a new and greatly improved stamped envelope. The dif- ference between it and the old one consists in making the envelope adhesive, and appending an embossed seal, displaying the national emblems of the rose, thistle, and shamrock, in raised white upon a delicate pink ground. Preparations are making on a scale of great magni- ficence at Lismore Castle to place that mansion in a suitable state for the reception of the Queen, who in- tends, it is stated, to honour the Duke of Devonshire with a visit at his grace's Irish mansion. The government prisons on Dartmoor, where 10,000 French prisoners were confined during the last war, it is highly probable will be converted at no distant day into a depot for convicts under smtence of transportation. No place could be better fitted for carrying out a refor- matory system of prison discipline, and the cultivation of the moor would afford both suitable and useful occu- pation to the prisoners. A few days ago, a man named Bates, landlord of the Boar's Head, Reading, was taken into custody as an j escaped convict. Bates had for some time past bpen leading a most reprobate life and his wife, having dis- covered that he was pursuing a systematic course of in- continenev towards her, was roused thereby to such a state of jealousy and anser as to induce her to commu- nicate to Superintendent Houlton the particulars of his trial at Warwick for sheep-stealing, his conviction and sentence to transportation for life, and his subsequent escape, from a penal settlement, about seventeen years ) since. It may be remembered that Goethe, in IS27, had de- livered over to the keeping of the Government of Wei- mar a quantity of his papers, contained in a sealed casket, with an injunction not to open it until 1850. The 1;5tl1 of May being fixed for breaking the seals. the authorities gave formal notice to the family of Gaithe that they would on that day deliver up the papers as di- rected by the deceased poet. The descendants of the poet Schiller also received an intimation that, as the the papers concerned their ancestors likewise, they had a right to be present. The casket was opened with all due form, and was found to contain the whole of the correspondence between Goethe and Schiller. The let- ters are immediately to be published, according to the directions found in the casket. On Tuesday one of the most remarkable churches ever erected in the metropolis was consecrated by the Bishop of London, in the presence of the Bishops of Oxford, Salisbury, and Brechin, Archdeacons Thorpe, Manning, and Harrison, the Rev. Dr. Pusey, the Rev. W. Sewell, the Rev. J. Keble, and upwards of 200 other clergymen, connected with what is usually termed the High Church party, all of whom appeared in full canonicals. The internal decorations of the church are of the most superb description, the chancel being in ap- pearance not unlike that of the Roman Catholic Cathe- dral in St. George's Under the eastern pait of the chancel is a crypt of a very curious construction. The windows of the church are of an elaborate character. The altar, the font, the vessels, the illumiuated office- books for the service of the altar, the vestments, the corona lucis on the altar, the eagle of brass, together with many costly ornaments, are the gifts of private in- dividuals. A short time since the rector of Stafford, having by dint of much personal exertion obtained subscrip- i tions towards the restoration and repair of his beautiful church, still found himself unable to meet all the claims which the outlay had occasioned. To supply the deficiency, he wrote to many persons of wealth and eminence in the country, politely apologising for the intrusion, and soliciting their aid. The following is a copy of the reply which the worthy rector received to the application which he made to the Duke of Wellington:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\"F.M. the Duke of Wellington presents his compliments to Mr. Coldwell. As Mr. C. feels that his letter needs apology, the duke will say no more on that subject, but he must add that, as there is not a church, chapel, glebehouse, school, or even a pagoda, built from the North to the South Pole, or within the uttermost limits of the earth, to which he (the Duke of Wellington) is not called upon to con- tribute, the Duke is surprised that Mr. Coldwell, having already raised \u00c2\u00a37,500 towards the restoration of his church, should make application to the Duke, who has nothing to say, either to Stafford, or to Staffordshire.\" Im- mediately upon the receipt of the epistle the rev. gentle- man was offered five guineas for the autograph, which he readily accepted, entering the amount ir. his subscrip- tion list as the Duke of Wellington's contribution to the fund.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdStaffordshire Advertiser. j The great problem of the economical decomposition of water for the purpose of artificial illumination, appears to be much nearer solution in America than is supposed. It is a well-known principle that a current of electricity, whether galvanic or fractional, on passing through water, has the power of decomposing it, giving out oxygen at one pole, and hydrogen at the other and we learn that a Mr. Henry M. Payne, of Worcester (United States), has ingeniously taken advantage of this prin- ciple in the production of hydro-carbon gas, for the purpose of both lighting and heating dwellings. The apparatus for lighting his own dwelling is contained ill a box eighteen inches square and eight inches deep, From this box, two flat copper wires are conducted into the decomposing jar, containing the water, forming the two poles of the battery; and as the pure hydrogen escapes, it passes into a carbonising vessel. The process of carbonising is stated to be far from costly, the car- bonising gass for three burners for a week amounted only to one cent. It appears that, 0n the 23nd April list, Mr. Payne had his residence brilliantly illuminated for the purpose of exhibiting his complete success to his friends, and many gentlemen connected with gas companies, scientific bodies, &c. It is stated that, although only one small burner was employed in each room, yet the light was dazzling, perfectly white, and so pure, that the most delicate shade of blue and green could be distinguished at several feet distance. The gas was supplied through a pipe, a quarter of an inch in diameter. For heating purposes, the company were shown a simple machine, consisting of two discs of iron, raised a few inches from the floor, and between which two or three small jets of pure hydrogen were burning and, in a few minutes after lighting, an equable and genial heat pervaded the apartment. One cubic foot of water will produce 2,109 feet of gas. The report of harvest prospects from all parts of Ire- land are everything that could be wished for, the Cork Examiner states that in that county, and in Limerick and Kerry, the breadth of potatoes sown is on the aver- age as large as any for the last ten years. The crops look right well, the late rains having been highly ser- viceable, and everything promises abundantly for the coming harvest. Intelligence has just arrived of the arrest of an entire family, in number five or six, living in Ballincuslane, near Castle-island, on suspicion of murder. A man, named Horan, who was servant in the house, got mar- ried two or three years ago to the widow of his master, a rich farmer, named Kenny. Since then they lived very unhappily, and eventually separated, and twice since the separation Horan's life was endangered, it is said, by his wife's sons. On one occasion he was tired at, and received some of the contents, and on Wed- nesday last he was sent for by his wife, to meet her at another farm. He went, and has not since been heard of. The wife, her sons, and servants have been arrested, and are now in Castleisland bridewell. Two or three weeks since an aged and wealthy English centleman, named Hartley, who had resided many years in France, died at Calais. When a young man, he had lived in Southampton, where he had considerable pro- perty. Mortified by some domestic misfortune while residing in that town, he locked up his house, furnished as it was, and went abroad. From that time he never resided in it, and refused to let or sell it, and there it stands in the High-street, with a dwarf brick wall and trees and weeds before it. Some years ago a disreputable fellow was seen on the roof, and on investigation it was found that some thieves had been living in the house, and were secretly carrying off the furniture. Mr. Hartley owned a large piece of garden ground near the South- ampton Railway terminus, which he refused to sell, although he might have had a building land price for it. The Itchcn Bridge Company took a portion by act of Parliament, but he refused to accept the price awarded, and the money is now in the bank into which it was paid. Toe other pori ion is still a vegetable garden, although the surrounding land is built on and forms a small town. It was owing to the obstinacy of Mr. Hartley in refusing to sell his garden that the original plan of the streets near the terminus was altered and that curious circular street was formed leading from the rail way station to the High-street. Mr. Hartley visited Southampton occasionally very privately, but few of its present inhabitants ever saw or knew him. Every one imagined that he was a misanthrope, and that he dis- liked both the people and the town. It appears also that he was ostentatious of showing indifference to religion. Singular to say, after he was dead it was found by his will that he desired to be buried in a Lon- don Wesley an burial-ground, and that he has bequeathed to the corporation certain property for the purpose of forming a library and scientific institute in that town which vill amount, it is fully believed, to a sum not less than \u00c2\u00a3 20,000 or \u00c2\u00a3 25,000. A member of the Lon- don Slock Lxcliangc, and a boutharupton so licitor, are his exccutois. Pleasure loves the garden and tho flowers labour loves the fields :md the grains devotion loves the moun- tam and the skies.

The meeting is looked forward to with much interest by what is generally termed the High Church Party, the principal men con- nected with which will be present to take part in the proceedings. The promoters arc anxious to secure the countenance and support of all who feel that a tacit ac- quiescence by the Church of England in the rccent de- cision of the Privy Council would be an unspeakable misery. An address to the Throne will be submitted to the meeting, setting forth the Church's rights as to spiritual freedom, reminding Her Majesty of the decla- ration prefixed to the Articles of Religion, and praying therefore the Royal license that convocation may be summoned for the express purpose of vindicating or authoritatively declaring the doctrine of the Church of England on Holy Biptism. There will also be snhmit- j ted a memorial to the episcopate of the two provi nces, I including the colonial bishops, ns being technically in the province of Canterbury, and an address to the bishops of Scotland expressive of thankfulness and con- fidence. The day is to open with the celebration of the most solemn ecclesiastical offices in several London churches, and those who purpose taking part in the nveting will be invited to attend service either at West minster Abbey or St. Paul's Cathedral. Many of the highest ecclesiastical dignitaries have expressed ap- proval of the proposed course of proceeding, and have intimated their intention of being present at the meeting. MR. CanDES AND CAPTAIN AARON SMITH'S FRIEND.\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdFurther, and we should imagine final, correspondence between Mr. Cobden and Capt. Aaron Smith's friend\" has been made public. The former gentleman, before noticing his correspondent's allega- tions in defence of the injured Captain, requests an an- swer to the follolving tilieslions 1. Are you the Edmund Garbett (formerly of Wellington, Shropshire), who was last year struck off the rolls for having been implicated in a case of perjury in an affidavit of costs 2. Are you the Edmund Garbett who in May, 1547, was convicted of forgery at the Old Bailey, and was sentenced to transportation, bnt was set at liberty on a technical point of law reserved for the decision of the judges?\" Mr. Garbett, in his response, calls Mr. Cob- den a \"humbug,\" abstains from any answer to the questions put to him, and savs:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\" I am that person who, in 1844-181,5, was your correspondent of the Corn Law League. I am that person who two years ago, at your request, went to Stockport to vote for your friend Francis Duckinfield Palmer Astley. And now, in re- turn, let me ask you\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdAre you the Richard Cobden whose bills in 1S45 were offered me under the firm o! Cobden, Brothers, for discount at 40 per cent.\" Mr. Cobden in a letter to the limes which accompanies this correspondence, says Public men are liable, on public grounds, to be led into a correspondence with persons of infamous character, and such is my present case. One of the most artful devices by which such characters endeavour to escape public exposure is by trying to fasten upon their correspondent the odium of a previous acquaintanceship. I need hardly add, that the stories in the accompanying letter are all pure in- cntions, and that I am prepared to answer the queries in my own letter in the affirmative.\" NATIONAL BENEVOLENT EMIGRATION FU\\D. k society, promoted by the Bishop of Durham, the Lord Mayor, Mr. Hyde Clark, Mr. H. Brown, M P., Mr. j Wyld, M P-, Mr- P. E Barnes, barrister-at-law, Nlr. Edward Kelly, and others, is about to be established for the emigration of the widows and orphan daughters of gentlemen, clergymen, professional men, officers, bankers, and merchants. The object is to enable ladies to emigrate. Unfortunately there are many of this class in England who, from the death or misfortunes of their natural protectors, become thrown upon their own resources for support. The occupation of the governess is that to which they are in general, com- polled to resort. To speak commercially, the market in respect of governesses is overstocked. The rate of remuneration is, therefore, so lamentably low that highly educated women cannot subsist upon it in a manner at all suited to their station. Many canllot find employment. The meanness of the pay to gover- nesses is proverbial. Mr. Hyde Clarke and others are j endeavouring to help them to a much better position for themselves, and much greater utility to the world at large, by opening to them a means of emigrating to our numerous colonies. From the correspondence with the Colonial Office, it would appear there is a bona fide desire on the part of the Government to favour the firm establishment of the society. THE NEW HorsEs OF PARLIAMENT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd It is clear that hon. members, as well as the reporters, have diffi- culty in catching the words of any speaker in the new House of Commons. Gentlemen whose voices are noted for strength of tone, have been called upon to speak up,\" and have pettishly declared tijot they were speaking as loud as they could.\" During the debate on the Marriages Bill on Thursday night, after Col. Chatterton had proposed his important amendment that Ireland be excluded from the operation of the Bill,- Mr. Farrer moved that the Chairman report progress. He had not heard one word of the honourable gentle- i ma!\"s S' )ecch \"-(cheers and loud laughter). The re- porters add, that the honourable and gallant gentleman ] was equally inaudible in the gallery. Colonel Sibthorp corroborated the assertion of the honourable gentleman. lIe had heard nothing of the speech in question, and he thought that the sooner they got out of this unwhole- some climate and into their beds the better\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd(loud laughter). On the same evening, Mr. Hume wished to know whit was the meaning of the extraordinary illu- mination which had been displayed all the night\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd(the i lighting of the house partially from the exterior, and partially in the interior).\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdIt had given him a headache, an affection to which he was very little aecustomed- (great laughter). It was altogether intoleralile-(re- newed laughter)\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand he protected against their sitting in that house again until the accommodation was better. THE PATENT FIRE ANNIIIILATOR Co.trAN-Y.-Orl Saturday a large assemblage of spectators assembled at Plumstead marshes, near Woolwich, to witness an ex- periment on a large scale of the power possessed by gas in extinguishing a large body of flame. It will be recollected that some time ago an invention was patented for putting out fire rapidly by vapour, without recourse being had to the usual method of using large bodies of water and that Mr. Phillips, the discoverer of the new process, exhibited his contrivance very successfully at the gasworks near Vauxhall-bridge. The Board of Ordnance being anxious to test the merits of Mr. Phillips's inven- tion, gave facilities for a trial on a large scale, in the usual practising-ground on Plumstead marshes. A two- story house was erected and constructed in such a manner as to ignite easily and 12 o'clock on Saturday was fixed as the hour for setting the house on fire, and giving the Patent Fire Anniiiilator Company an oppor- tunity of extinguishing the flames if they could. The Marquis of Anglesey and a large staff of artillery officers were present on the occasion, and witnessed the experi- ment. Shavings and other combustible materials were collected in the house, and every means was taken to render the experiment a decisive one. Fire having been applied, the lower storr of the building was in a very short time in a blaze, and the flames were beginning to mount into the upper compartment, when the signal was given by Mr. Phillips, and one of the annihilators was moved to the window, and the gas which it evolved was pouring upon the burning pile. For a moment the flames appeared to be checked, but they had acquired too much strength. Another and more powerful ma- chine was then moved forward, with a hose attached to it, but the heat was now so great that the men could not approach near enough to bring the vapour to bear. A third and equally unsuccessful etfort was made with a still larger machine. The fire had taken complete pos- session of the entire building, and was bursting out through the roof. A strong breeze of wind was blowing at the time, and fanned the fury of the flames. So great was the heat that the men employed to work the patent were quite unable to approach within anything like a reasonable distance for their purpose, and, moreover, I such efforts as they did make were to leeward, instead of being on the windward side. In a space of time shorter than we have taken to describe it the attempt to put out the fire was abandoned as hopeless, and the t building was entirely and most effectually destroyed without let or hindrance. The experiment, therefore, was a comrlete failure; and tiie rpneral impression al)- j peared to be, that for houses oil fire there will always be extreme difficulty in the successful application uf be exti-enic d? apl)l?caL;Oll the patent. On shipboard, however, it may be otherwi-e and it would certainly be unfair to decide finally on the merits of an invention which has already successfully undergone several severe tests, and which, in a chymical and scientific point of view, has strong claims to patient consideration and trial. The men employed by the company to conduct the experiment did not appear to go about their work in a skilful manner, and Mr. Phillips \u00c2\u00a1 himself appeared so anxious to show the pow er of Lis j invention that the fire had made such progress as to be quite irresistible before he attempted to check it. Lord Brougham was present, aiid appmred to take a lively interest in the experiment. FRIENDS SCAPCE.

DEATH OF MR. WYATT.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMr. Richard J. Wyatt- the eminent English sculptor, died at Rome on the 29th ult., after a few days' illness, and was buried in the Protestant burial ground.

Mr. Wyatt went to Rome in 1832, and worked for Mr. Gibson after a few years he commenced his career, in which he has been so success- ful. It is said that he has executed commissions to the extent of \u00c2\u00a3 20,000 sterling. He was in the fift) seventh year of his age. As yet no will has been found.

It appears that the unfortunate gentleman had been called to breakfast, but no answer was given, and the door of his apartment being found to be locked, Mrs. Craigie directed the coachman and other servants to force it open, when a fi-ightful scene presented itself Dr. Elliott was immediately scut for, and on arriving found the Colonel extended on the floor, living, but speechless and insensible from the excessive los of blood. He had cut his throat across with a deep gush and had also inflicted similar wounds in his legs, as well as below the hamstrings. Besides this he had punctutrd his abdomen in three places wi, h a small penknifi.. which, as well as the razor, v as foun d in the room covered with blood. Dr. Elliott was speedily assisted by other medical gentlemen, but all attempts to save his life were fruitless, and the deceased expired in less than an hour. He had been for some time exceedingl depiesst d in spirits, arising, it is understood, from anxietirs relating to some members of his family. We utide, stand that the unfortunate gentleman was a retired Lieut. Colonel in the Bengal army. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Exeter Gazette STRANGE DISCLOSURE ON A DEATH-BED. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn Tues day evening an inquest was held at the Queen's Head Inn, Portmahon, before T. Badger, Esq., coroner, to inquire into the cause of the death of Ellen Scot;, aged 24 years, wife of George Scott, of Queen-street. who died under circumstances of a very painful nature on Sunday morning last. It appears that had been married about four years, and was lying-in of her first child, which was born on the 21th of May. Since her confinement she has been very much depressed in spirits. A few days ago she became alarmingly ill. and earnestly desired to see her mother. The mother was immediately sent for from Northampton, and ar rived in Sheffield on Saturday evening. At the station she was met by another of her daughters, who told her that Ellen was dying broken-hearted.\" On arriving at her son-in-law's (Scott's) residence, the deceased said to her. I'm glad you have come, for I could not die without seeing you.\" On the mother inquiring what ailed her, she placed her hand upon her heart, and bursting into tears, exclaiuicd, That rogue has killed me; he has killed me The mother having been left alone with the deceased, and having succeeded in sooth ing her, she proceeded to unburden her mind of the cause to her grief. She stated that some time ago she went to a shop in Shalesmoor to buy a piece of cloth for her husband. The master of the shop invited her to walk into an upper room. She did so, and or. reaching the top of the stairs he forced her into a chamber, locked the door, and, after a struggle, over- turned her and effected an unlawful purpose. T fj i disclosure she had previously made to her medical at attendant (Mr. J. H. Smith), to her nurse, and likewise to her husband, whose pardon she had implored and received. After the interview with her mother she gradually became worse, and died in frightful agonies about a quarter-past six on Sunday morning. It an peared that shortly after this illicit intercourse sne became for the first time enceinte, but neither before nor during the time of pregnancy did she complain to her husband of what bad transpired. For some time before her confinement, and during the hour of her trouble, some circumstances seemed to press heavily on her mind, and in a few days after the birth of the child she confessed to her husband the wrong which had been done to him. The jury, upon the strength of ti-c medical testimony, returned a verdict that the deceased died of fever, together with inflamation of the lungs, caused by shouting when in the paroxisms of her disease induced by excitement and depression of mind.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdSheffield Times.

{"ocr": "OLD MAIDS; OE, A MISTAKE ABOUT MARRIAGE BY MRS. S. C. HALL. When I was a little girl, I was a fat, merry, jolly dump- ling, as happy as the day was long. Everybody pinched my red cheek-, and I waddled about with my doll in my plump arms, finding fun in everything, and fully helieving that the doll was as sensible as myself; and perhaps she was, almost. But, although I a natural auiipathv to a spelling book, and no fondness for spending a whole summer's afternoon in poking a needle in and out of a piece of calico, though I considered patchwork all foolishness, and gussets as utter superfluities, though 1 was called a simpleton for asking my inotter why she cut cloth up and then sewed it together again, still. I was food of picking up ideas after my own f'shioa. When the wise people around me supposed I was \u00c2\u00bb iking of nothing else but my plav, mv two little ears were open to every word spoken within my hearing. And t.t.,y was the word impressed on my memory which the speaker to got next moment. The talk around me was my real education, as it is of all children, send them to what school you may. When I tv.<s ten years old, I had one sister aged fifteen, and another seventeen; and, as usml with piris of that age they had a set of cronies, some very like and some very un- like them in chancer. One afternoon, as I was tending my doll Ophelia, who was sick in bed, I heard a brisk discussion among these g!r! which, I may almost say, decided my fate for life. The first words that caught my attention came from an auimited, romantic jiirl of s:xteen, scolding because the heroine of a novel she had just read was left unmarried at the end of the story. What suiprise was expressed at this cat3s!rppi\u00c2\u00a1l' !-w/\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a1,t indignation One of my sistf-rs did not seem to sympathise with this burst of disapprobation, and then came the pithy question, What would you be willing to die an oid maid 7\" Mary selid very quietly, ''Yes; and sister Ellen added, \"So would I!\" Then sech looks of amazement and incredulity. \"You can t mean what you sr.y, cried one. If I did not know you too well to think you a hypocrite\"aid another. Why, it was meant that all women should be married exclaimed a third. \"Then why are they not all married ?\" asked Maty, with her usual simplicity. li iger and hot grew the controversy, and I lost not a word. Ophelia lay Hit on her back, her stiff kid arms sticking out and her croup g,dte forgotten. Then first did I take notice of that terrible combination of monosylables,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\"Old Maid.\" Iu how many different tones of contempt, dread, and depre- cation, did I hear it uttered by those juvenile voices What anecdotes came across about old maids, and fidgettyold maids, and ugly, and dressy, and learned, and pious, and flirting, and mischiei-making old maids. Never did a bevy of fifty-year-old spinsters utter so much scandal in one afternoon as was poured forth by these young creatures. Two or three friends of my mother, whom I had always cherished in my innocent affections, because they talked so pleasantly and were so kind to me, now appeared like new personages. \"M is, Z. was so ugly, she never could have had an offer Miss Y. dressed soshabby, and wore green spectacles to look literary.\" And \"Miss X. was for ever talking about Sunday-school and society-meetings,\" and so on. You may be sure that the next time these ladies come to our house, I scanned very closely the face of Miss Z., a face that I had always loved before but now I saw that it was exceedingly plain. I looked hard at Miss Y.'s drab- coloured bonnet and shawl, perceived that they were old- fashioned and ordinary, and that her green spectacles looked pedantic. When Miss X beside whom I had al- ways squeezed in ufon the sofa, encouraged by her kindly s'nile and delighted with her conversation-how uninter- esting she had become They were all old maids! It must be observed that my sisters\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdright good, sensible, domestic girls they were\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhad no part iu this bewilderment of my young ideas. They were in the minority, so I took it for granted they were in the wrong. Besides, what chil- dren are ever as much influenced by what is uttered in the familiar voices of their own family, as by words of compa- rative strangers ? Take care of what you say at a friend's house, with the young folks catching up every random sentiment that you drop. Many a judicious mother's morn- ing exhortation has been blown to the moon by some slight remark from a dinner guest, who did not after all mean to give his real opinion, or whose opinion was not worth hav- ing. And now, I assure you, my education went on rapidly. It is perfectly marvellous in how many way-, and by what dif- ferent sort-iof people, ayoung girl is taught that it is aterrible thing to be an old maid. Fools show their folly more than in their hackneyed je-ts upon this topic but what shall we say of the wise folks who sin almost as often in the same way? what shall we say if the refinement of him who is gentlemanly in thought and expression on all subjects but this ?-of tiie humanity and chivalry of him who assails the defenceless?\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdof the justice of him who taxes a class with the faults of individuals, and wounds with that meanest of weapons\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda sneer?\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdor of thechri-tianityof him who in- directly censures and ridicules one of the arrangements of Providence? I learned my lesson thorough!}', for it came to me in some shape every week. Ireaiit in every novel and news- paper, and heard it from every lip. The very man wi o spoke truth andsense on the subject, sometimes neutralised it by an idle jest in some moment of levity, and the jest drove out the truth from my young heart. At eighteen, I lived only for the ignoble purpose-I cannot bear to say\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd of getting married: but what could have been the ruling wish of one who had been taught by society to dread celi- bacy wor e than death ? I dare siy 1 betrayed it in the ball room, in the street, everywhere. I dare say I was duly hug-hed at. At last, quaking on the verge of six-aud-twenty, I had an ofier;\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda most absurd one. 1 wai six years older than my lo-< r, had ten times as much sense, probably, except oil one point. 1 knew that tie was I- rather wild,\" as the gentle phrase goes. In short, I neither loved nor respected him; but I was willing to marry him, because then I should be r. bi- oil in:,id. Mrs. Somebody, and \"h.nild not be an old maid. My parents said So,\" positively. Of course I thought them unreasonable and cruel, and made myself very mise- rable. Still, it was something to have had an offer of dny kin.i, and my lips ere hermetically sealed. I had several confidants, who took care that a'i try acquaintance should know the comfortable fact that I had refused Mr. S-. I ent on with increasing uneasiness a few years longer, not seeking how to be useful, or trying to find out for what good purpose I was made. Neither was I looking for a companion who could sympathise with my better aspira- tions and elevate my whole character, for I had no right views of marriage. I uas simply gazing about in anxious suspense upon every unmarried man of my acquaintance, for one who would lift me out of that dis,nal valley of Hu- miliation into which I found myself descending. Had 1 met A poll yon himself therewith the question on his Jips, I believe I should ha-e said Yes.\" At thirty-six I wore more pink ribbons than ever, was seen eveiywhere where a respectable woman could go, won- dered why girls went into company so young, found I was growing sharp-faced and sharp-spoken, and was becoming old-maidish in the worst sense of the word, because I was an old maid a\u00c2\u00abaii;st my will. I forgot that voluntary ce- libacy never affects the temper. .Mysiste:s, be it rc membered, were older than I. They too, \u00c2\u00abire single. But they had lived more domestic lives than I, had read fewer works of fiction, had been culuvatlng their own nature- and seeking to make everybody around them happy. And everybody reverenced them, and loved to look !'P\"II their open pleasant countenances\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd1 mean every Lody worth I;Ieas, n,ai,d they were very happy. At last our good parents died, and left each of us a little independence. Within a year I was married. I was mar- ried for my money. That was ten years ago, and they have been ten years of purgatory. I have had bad luck as a wife, for my husband and I have scarcely one taste in common. He wishes to live in the country, which I hare. I like the thermometer at 75 deg., wh:ch he hates. lie likes to have the children brought up at home instead of at school, which 1 hate. I like music, and want to go to conceits, which he hates. He likes roa-t pork, which i hate; aud I like minced veal, which he hates. Theie is but one thing, which we both like, and that is what we cannot both ha-.e\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthough we are always trying for it- the latt word.

At the Bute Docks he was invited into the Angel Inn omnibus, and theieupon he gave his luggage to some person. He took his seat in the omnibus, and was there fione; and after remaining there some time, Mr. Robert Phillips came into it. Mr. Philips Take care, sir, you are on your oath. Nlr.

I am so iufirin that I canuot walk well. I was much injured. Cross-examined by Mr. Phillips To the best of my knowledge you are the person. Mr. Phillips: Were yoa drunk or sober on board the Star Mr. Prichard I am not speaking of what took place on board the Star. Mr. Phillip*: Were you drunk or soher? Mr. Prichard I am not speaking of the Star, but of the omnibus. Mr. PhitHpa I ask you whether you were drunk or sober on the occasion you refer to? Mr. Prichard appealed to the bench whether he was bound to answer that question. A man might have beeu drunk on board the Star and still have been perfectly able to recollect circumstances which took place subsequently. Air. Vachell: We want to know whether you were in that state of mind which would enable you to have a distinct conception of circumstances. You must answer the question. Mr. Prichard said something in an undertone, after which The Mayor said-Mr. Prichard was under the influence of liquor. Mr. Phillips: When you came on shore, were you drunk or sober ? Mr. Prichard I am speaking of the omnibus. Mr. Phillips: Were you drunk or sober ? Mr. Prichard I don't know when a man is able to say whether he is drunk or sober (laughter). I am not in- vited to do this by any other party. I do not do it from spite. I firmly believe that you were in the omnibus at the time. Mr. Phillips: I will prove to you I was not off the deck of the vessel from half-past eight to half-past eleven. Benjamin James, steward of the Siar steamer, examined When Mr. Prichard came on board of our vessel, at Bristol, he was in a dreadful state of intoxication. Mr. Prichard was landed out of our vessel at about half after nine, and I sent one of the ablest men we had in the ship to take care of him. Mr. Phillips was on board taking an account of the cargo, and did not leave the vessel before the omnibus went off. It was not possible that he could leave; and he did not leave till some time after eleven at night. Cross-examined: Mr. Phillips was acting that night for Mr. Harvey. I do not know how he went home that night. Morgan Davies and two or three others brought a message for Mr. Phillips to say that you were insulting people at the warehouse, but Mr. Phillips did not leave the vessel. Matthew Gcdrych, a young man of respectable appear- ance and demeanour, said that last Friday night fortnight he saw Mr. Prichard lying along the seat of the Angel omnibus. Several parties\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdsome ladies-were \"obliged to turn out,\" for reasons which the witness stated, but which we cannot report. The conductors of the omnibus felt it to be their duty to remove Mr. Prichard; and\" as he would not come by fair means he was taken out rather violently.\" Mr. Phillips was not seen there by witness. No one had any- thing to do with the taking out but the conductor.\" Cross-examined It was about half-past nine o'clock. I rode up in the omnibus, and was in town soon after ten o'clock. There was no unnecessary violence used in re- moving Mr. Prichard; and after he had left, about eight or ten persons rode up. There was a lady in the omnibus, and she turned out till Mr. Prichard had been removed. I swear that Mr. Phillips was not in the omnibus. The conductor entered to take Mr. Phillips out. George Davies, a young man who seemed to fill a respect- able position in life, said that on the day and at the hour named, he and several others found one side of the Angel Inn omnibus occupied by Mr. Prichard; and that he and other passengers positively declined to ride up in it unless 'c he (Mr. Prichard) was removed. Mr. Prichard was so intoxicated that he could not stand in the omnibus; witness could stand in it, but not upright. [The reasons which induced the passengers to request that Mr. Prichard should be removed were fully stated to the court.] The magistrates said that if it could be proved that the man who invited Mr. Pfichard into the omnibus had taken part in ejecting him, they would punish him fevcrety. They were extremely sorry to hear that Mr. Prichard had suffered ill-treitment. They believed, however, that the same rule applied to omnibuses as to railway carriages, namely, that no person in a state of intoxication should travel by them and as it had beeu proved, by indisputable evidence, that Mr. Prichard was intoxicated, they (the magistrates) dis- missed the case. Mr. Phillips You see, gentlemen, I had nothing what- ever to do with it. I shall sue Mr. Prichard for my ex- penses in another court. A SUCCESSFUL DODGER. John Culhane, landlord of the Mason's Arms beer-house, Bridge-street, was charged with having kept his house open 'It a quarter past one on Sunday morning, at which hour nine men were drinking and smoking therein.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdP.C. t Dibble, who was examined in support of the charge, said that having ascertained that persons were drinking in Cul- hane's house he knocked at the door. Culhane asked who knocked and was answered by Dibble, who imitated an Irishman's whine.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\"An sure its Mick,\" upon which the door was opened immediately but when the blues\" were perceived-for P.S. Rollins was also PIc-cut-Culhane ex- claimed in dismay, its the p'Kece.\" The allegations stated in the charge were fully proved.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdP.S. Rollins gave evidence which went to show that the house was irregu- larly kept,-Culhane began to blubber\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdprotested he was int)ocent-ma(ie references to\" his larore family, that he was working hard to maintain, and succeeded so admirably that he was discharged on payment of the costs (2s ) I IMPORTANT TO THE KATE-PAYERS. John Connell, an Irishman, was charged by Mr. John, relieving officer, with having deserted his wife and child. The circumstances of this case disclose a few of the tricks resorted to by the Irish ia order to extract the means of subsistence from the people of this country. From the tenor of Mr. John's statement we gathered that fourteen weeks ago Johanna Connell, wife of the defendant, applied to the Board of Guardians for relief, which was granted to her on account of a sick child, and as she protested that her husband was in America. The relief has been continued up to this time. The defendant had, also, applied for relief alleging his inability to obtain a livelihood by reason of an inflammation in his eyes: he said his name was John Barry and that he had a wife aud three children. Temporary relief was granted but Mr. John, who invariably takes op- portunity to pounce upon the recipients of public charity when least expected, having caught this Irish vagabond en joying himself and a party of friends with whiskey in Love Lane, immediately caused the parish allowance tt) be dis- ;ontinued. The whiskey Wat supposed to have been the treat\" of a potatoe merchant. Johanna Connell weut nto the House of Refuge without an order, and was cou- Ined immediately which induced Mr. John to inspect that he husband was not far off, A trap was laid into which util fell; and thW day Mr, Jolm prgdijqod letter which shewed that the fellow wag on the eye of starting for America and t'lat \"his money was ready for him onL to send for it,\" therpby plainly indicating that the whining scoundrel w.-g not in distitnle circumstances; and Mr. John, we bc1ieve, as not tbe slightest hesitation in saving that there are scores of Irish in Cardiff wh > do nothing hut scheme\" how they can must sllccessfully deceive the eha- ritai ly-dispo^cd and to impose unon the public; aud the tir-i lesson. taught to their children is 10 tell lie-* and to \u00c2\u00a1r..tise deception \"it is, therefore, natural (Mr. John conti iueil) if a person like myself listens doubtingly to dmost every talJ of woe m clevtr v told by the Iiish, feeI- ing convinced tbat, thnre i. Ij() re il destirutiu:1 among Ihe Hibernian p0l'utat,on of this bwn.\" A desultory conver-ation en-ned but ultimately the im- postor wa- sent to prison for fourteen days, there to be kept to hard labour. DISGRACEFUL Fanny Davies, whose face bore several scratches, was charged with having indulged in a fight in Mary Anne- street, and with having, subsequently, thrown stones at a man in Bridge-ftreet. She was so violent that P.C. Wall was obliged to take her into custody.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe defendant, who was, apparently, not a hardened offender, complained of ill- usage at the hands of a man and woman, which exasperated her and impelled her to attack them. In reply to the Mavor, she said that she had got drunk at the Merthyrand DowUis Inn.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdCautioned and discharged. ROBBERY FROM THE PERSON. Mary Anne Hall, a young woman of ill-fame, was charged with stealing from the person of William Watson, \"of Dublin, gentleman of the General Post Office,\" one gold ring and one sovereign, while in a house of ill-fame in Bute Terrace, kept by Albert Ashley; but as no one appeared to prosecute, she was dismissed with a serious reprimand. A LLANCARVAN BUTCHER. Fanny Thomas, an old offender, was charged with stealing some money, the property of Evan Howell, of Llancarvan, butcher. The prosecutor was evidently remarkably verdant, and went to a house of ill-repute with Fanny, who pro- mised to find him lodgings and to make him comfortable.\" He was taken to the house of a Mrs. Alexander, on the Tunnel, and had not been there ten minutes before he was robbed of \"about a sovereign,\" by his companion, the pri- soner.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe magistrates gave the foolish fellow some ex- cellent advice and dismissed the case. A VAGABOND RIGHTLY PUNISHED. George Ecans, a miserably deformed cripple, was charged by Superintendent Stockdale with having exhibited his hor- rible condition in a public thoroughfare with the view of ex- torting alms from passers-by. Theca-e was fully proved, and the wretched sinner was sentenced to be committed to Ihe House of Correction for ten days, there to be kept to hard labour. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Thus, the defendant's olject in visiting this neigh- bourhood\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat of making a rich harvest at Llandaff fdir- has beeD, very propetly, defeated. AN OLD SOLDIER DISGRACED. James Thomas, a pensioner, from Carmarthen,& formerly of the lith Lancers, was charged with stealing a tarpaulin, the property of Mr. Thomas Christopher, farmer. Uane- ,!erne,-Tt.,e prisoner \\VIIS entering the town at \"very early honr on Friday morning, when he wa? seen by P.S. Ho11ins, and stopped in Crockhcrbtown, with the tarpaulin on his shoulders. He was questioned and, liS he gave an unsatis- factory account of himself, he was detained. Further en- quiries were made; and it was then ascertained that Mr. Christopher's property had been plundered.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe prisoner was committed for trial. THE SILK ROBBERY. Mr John Bird, solicitor, addressed the magistrates; and said that in consequence of the publicity given to the evi- dence taken on Thursday with reference to the robbery of silk at Warwick House, he (Mr. Bird) was instructed by Mrs. Hewitt, the wife of the landlord of the Locomotive Inn. to deny, with reference to the statement that in the purchase of some silk by her of a man named Gibby, she was informed by him tllat the p3fcel was sent by Fisher. Mrs. Hewitt affirms that Gibby made no such statement, but that he said the silk belonged to his wife. Some observations were made by the magistrates, and the matter dropped but as Gibhy was not present to answer for himself, we must, in fairness, observe that his evidence was taken upon oath, and was perfectly consistent through- out FAULT ON BOTH SIDES. Mary miliamt, of the Merthyr and Dowlais Inn, was charged with assaulting Jane Jenkins. a dress-mak<*r, on Monday last.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe complainant said that she had made a gown for Williams, and had consented to receive two yards of the material, which were not required, in payment, but had charged Is. 61. for trimmings. When asked for pay- ment, by a messenger, the drfendant used some insulting expressions, which induced Miss Jenkins to go herself and inquire into matters; the result of which was that the de- fendant struck her and her companions, and \"tore skeins of hair from her head.\" The defendant said that she had been tint pushed and had been assailed by three persons. She had also skeins of hair pulled from her head.\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThe magistrates told them that they had both acted wronoly- ordered each to pay 3s. costs, and dismissed the case. D THE SHIP AND PILOT BOAT PUBLtC HOUSE. Superintendent Stockdale said that this public-house still cmtinued to be most disorderly but it W8S of no use what- ever to lay any fresh informations because two fines im- posed upon the landlord now remained unpaid. He (Su- perintendent Stockdale) had levied a distress; but in conse- quence of a letter from the Mayor, he had relinquished the property, and had then to app'y for a fresh warrant. The Mayor: Docs that follow as a matter of coarse? Superintendent Stockdale Oh yes, sir, because I was in possession of the coods. The Mayor: The woman came crying to me, and so I gave her the letter. Mr. Evans: Oh, I dare say she did. sir. She understands how to make such applications well enough. Superintendent Stockdale: There are now two fines against the landlord of that house. The Mayor: Let them have another week; and if the money be not then paid, issue a distress warrant. Superintendent Stockdale: Already. sir, t!n-y have had two months. THE CHARGE AGAINST FISWEH. Intelligence having been received that ex-policemnn Fisher had been taken at C*erleon, Superintendent Stock- dale mentioned the matter to the magist ates and added,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd In the event of the information being unfounded [which it subsequently proved to be] will it not be advisable to in- sert an advertisement in the local paper offeriug a reward for his capture? Also, should Dot bills, to a similar pur- port, be circulased ?\" The magistrates decided to take no steps, but to wait for a short time longer. LORD POWIS'S SOCIETY FOR THE DIFFUSION OF GENERAL INFORMATION IN WALES. On Wedne-day, the 14th ult., a public meeting was held in the Town-hall, at Lampeter, to consider the claims of the above society upon public support. The bench appropriated to those who desir,.d to address the meeting, was filled Wlh influential residents in the neighbourhood, and the body of the Town-hall wa, gradually crowded with a numerous and attentive audi\u00c2\u00a1>nce. At the sicte of the Very Reverend the Dean of Saint David's, who WM formally voted into the chair, we observed Thoma8 Lloyd. Esq., of Bronwydd, William Jones, Esq., of Falcondale, Reverends Rowlaud Williams, Professor North, Charles Lloyd, William Hughes, James James, Evan Jones, Thomas Jone-, vicar of Pen- carre\u00c2\u00a1{, &C., &c. The Dean of St. Dayid's having taken the chair, expressed his Fatisfactioll ilJ supporting a society entirely free from party objects, and after a high compliment to Lord Powis, pointedout the importance of disseminatiug general know- ledge, either as a preservative from mere ignorance, or as an antidote to delusions, which usurped the name of know- ledge. Rev. Professor North moved the first resolution,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\"That it is desirable to extend among our poorer countrymen facilities for acquiring general information.\" It assumed, the speaker observed, a certain want, the existence of which was evident without borrowing proofs from the statements which had been much canvassed in the celebrated reports of the Education Commissioners (hear, hear). William Jones, Esq. (banker), seconded the resolution, with some pertinent remarks. There existed, he believed, no common desire among the Welsh people to gain the means of information\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthat desire he thought it the duty of those, who could do so, to aid by all proper means (applause). Thomas Lloyd. Esq., of Bronwydd, in moving the second resolution,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd\"That there exists a numerous class of persons to whom English literature is neither accessible nor intel- ligible; but who would welcome the boon of a cheap series of interesting books in their own language,\" sketched the progress of popular literature, which he believed to be the growth of modern times. It was due, in a great measure, to the exertions of the Messrs. Chambers, of Edinburgh. It now occupied the thoughts and the pens of men who stood in the first ranks of their respective professions. The circulation of the Penny Magazine had reached the extra- ordinary number of 170,000 copies. Similar publications existed in the Welsh language, but not to the same extent. He did not presume to criticise them, but was willing to believe in their merit. He was, however, assured, that their habitual readers wished for an extension of their sphere; and the fact of such a wish being felt, was with him sufficient argument for something more (bear, hear). He would hold out for consideration the remarks of Prince Albert as to studying the signs of the times, and endeavour, ing to fulfil the duties pointed out by the cultivation of our reason (hear, hear). The Rev. Rowland Williams entered largely into a his- tory of the society, and an explanation of its objects. It was not antiquarian, or philological, neither were its immediate aims directly religious. It endeavoured to spread general knowledge, and to extend a taste for reading. The pursuits which it was calculated to foster, might be recommended both as a source of pure and permanent enjoyment, aud as preservatives from many vices. They also tended to en- large sympathies and teach duties. [Some statistics from Mrs. Somerville, showing that education went to diminish crime, and, incidentally, that eleven counties in Wales were the most virtuous in Great Britaio, were here introduced, to the amusemet of the audience.] The society had ori- ginated with some of the many Welshmen who had earned an honourable competence by their industry in the great metropolis. It had been taken up by Lord Powis, Colonel Trevor, and others It would uot interfere with those sub- jects in religion which could be considered controversial; but, indirectly, would maintain a frieodly alliance with all those who taught men their highest duties to their Heavenly Father (hear, hear). It was scarcely possible for any one to differ from the society. Its objects were such as all good men of all denominations hold in favour. Only, if any form of religion courted darkness, it would shrink from the light. The only doubt was as to u-ing the instrumentality of the Welsh language. This society simply recognised the fact of its existence. If the language was to die let it have an Euthanasia in diffusing knowledge-if It was to live, let it live as a useful medium, and not as a blank barrier (hear, hear). The District Committee might either send aid to the Parent Society, or might cheapen the books of the so- ciety to the poor of the neighbourhood. It should also register all regular purchasers of the books. and increase the number of associates, who might thus benefit by the society, though tbey could not afford to help it by subscrip- tions. The Rev. James James, in an eloquent and humorous speech, which we regret our inability to reproduce, pro- posed the next reso!ution, That the society formed under the auspices of Lord Po..i:; presents a desirable medium for circulating such works,\"\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe society was now in its cradle, but would grow to be a giant. Welshmen excluded by their language from general knowledge, were in the midst of human progress, like men looking on some fair landscape at midnight. Tlieir eyes were good, and the view was grand; but ther\" was no light upon it-yet the Welsh language had been spoken in Eden, and would last for ever (loud applause). The effect of the society would be to enable the poorest Welshman to read in his own tongue of the wonderlul works of God, as manifested in Nature or Science, or as to tending to practical ends (hoarj. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd[Both this gentleman, and the Rev. William Hughes, of Cilie Ayron, who seconded the third resolution, having spoken in the Welsh language, we can give but a feeble idea of the effect produced by their eloquence.] The remainder of the speakers, among whom, the Rev. Mr. Williams (Wesleyan Mimstei), was introduced by the Chairman of the meeting in highly nattering terms. It was uitimatdy agreed that a D\u00c3\u00adstdct,C?iJimittce should be formed, with arrangements for associating all persons who might become purchasers of books issued by the society. Some expressions of sympathy from John Jones, E.-q.,of Dolecothi, and U ughe\". Esq., ot Castel!, with apologies for their absence, were also communicated to tl e meeting. The proceedings terminate I with a vote of thanks to the Very Reverend Chairman, who accompanied his acknow- ledgements by a most earnest and elective appeal to the younger portion of the audience not to neglect the oppor- tunities of moral and intellectual improvement laid o;.cu to rhe society. We have been a1,1,. to furnish our readers with but a meagre outiine of the general proceedings, which were in the highest degree interesting. Lan-.p-ter has taken the lead among our towns iu a most important work, which\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd may God speed.

Prince Albert, and the Court and Royal Family, at Windsor Castle, and at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, for a year and a half, where it was viewed by over half a million persons. This magnificent Panorama of the three largest Rivers in North America, pourtrays accurately the River, forest, and Prairie Scenery of the Great West, passing through nine States of the American Union, and twelve degrees of latitude, from the rocky mountains and yellow stone bluffs of the Missouri, and Cincinnati, the Queen City of the West, on the Ohio, to the city of New Orleans, on the Mississippi, near the Gulf of Mexico; being by far the largest painting ever exc- outed by man. It shows life on the great western watera; the thriving cities and towns the early sertler'* hut, or log cabin the manner of clearing the land for cultivation; Indians hunting buffaloes a Burning Forest; the immense Prairies of grass; cypress swamps; the singular steam boats, flat boats, rafts, and other water craft of the Mississippi; a Prairie on Fire; Indian village by moonlight, &c., all combining to form a most instructive and entertaining exhibition. This is truly an extraordinary work. We have never seen a work of the same kind in which the subject was so grand in its whole character, so truthful in its delineations, or so interesting to the spectator.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdObserver, November 27th, J848.

The patronage of the Public has elevated its position to one ot the largest in the Trade. Our main object has been, and still is, to supply the Public on Trade Terms. Great and assuming as such an undertaking appears to be, it is obvious that to do Business on a VV holesale Scale,it is necessary to have wholesale appliances. In conformity with these ideas, our locality was chosen in a bye thoroughfare, where Space and Accommodation are sufficient to carry on trade to any extent, but without those merciless and enormous expenses inseparably attached to retail shopt in prominent situations, whereby an extravagant profit is reitdered necessary. Hence it will be seen that we are in a position to supply the public on the best and most economical terms\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdin fact to supply at first hand, by which all intermediate profits are saved. The immense varie'y of Teas now imported into this country, demands the mostecrutinizinn caution. In this we have consi- derable advantages, as from the extent of our trade, we are enabled to employ a qualified and experienced person, whose sole duty is that of carefully selecting, tasting, and appropriating Teas for consumption.

A MONG THE MANY DISCOVERIES that cha- *? racterise the present age, none have contributed so Inut-h to the comfort and ease of the community, nor Inferred \"uch a boon upon suffering humanity, as the ?'In ferre d -,?iie h a boon ii ?A on 8 GOUT AND UHL U- Irnrtant discovery of BLAIR'S GOUT AND RHEU- MATIC PILLS, the cfficacy of which has been tested by the approval and recommendation of many of the great- est men of our day. They are effective for gout and tlltutnatisni in all its various forms, including sciatica, lumbaio, pains in the head and face, frequently treated toothache, &c. They require neither confinement 13or attention of any kind, and invariably prevent the disease attacking the stomach, brain, or other vital part: In testimony of which Mr. Blake, Kingscliffe, North- amptonshire, writes- Twelve years ago I became afflicted with rheumatic gout. I procured the best advice possible, but without driving benefit; and the doctors recommended me to o to the Stamford Infirmary, where I continued twelve '\\V('('ks, and left it without obtaining any benefit, and all In hope of relief had vanished.

Thirdly-To remove the prejudices, to allay the apprehensions, and to engage the kindly offices of those who have formed unfavourable-opinions of the masses, as persons who have imbibed what are considered extravagant opinions and unwarrantable desires, as to Politics, Religion, and Social Philosophy and, Finally,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdTo excite in the minds of all an earnest desire for the amelioration of the condition of the toiling- J classes, and a determination to employ the most rational means of securing their physical, intellectual, social, and moral elevation- The aim of each writer must be carry out these objects in a calm and dignified tone, apart from personal in- vectives, or abuse of individuals whom bad systems may have betrayed into oppressive acts. It will not a vail to irritate wounds that are already too grievous to be borne the wisest course will be to point out the means by which healing and soundness may be best effected.

TOHN CASSELL'S BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG.-There are Primers, Spelling-Books, Grammars, and other CF helps to Elementary Education in abundance. There are also Libraries of Fairy Tales, Romances, and other wor k s of Fiction, for the amusement of youthful readers, almost without end. But there are still wanting cheap, well-written Books, adapted to the capacities of children, and furnishing information as to Natural Objects, Arts, Sciences, and Manufactures. To supply this want, John Cassell proposes to issue A NEW SERIES OF INSTRUCTIVE WORKS FOR CHILDREN To consist of Twelve Books it Sixpence each, in the form of catechisms or dialogues, divided into sections, and written in a style at once plain and familiar, interesting and instructive. The aim in this series will be, by judicious condensation, to furnish for the youthful mind such a store of information as shall prove of avail in after-life, at the same time that it excites a spirit of laudable inquiry, and an eager thirst for the higher branches of intellectual, scientific, and moral truth. i- It is believed that there are few parents, however humble their lot in life,; but will feel pleasure in presenting to their children a copy of each of these books as they make their appearance in succession. For use in schools, whet her public or private, they cannot fail to be acceptable. They will, also, be admirably adapted for presents, either as tokens of esteem or rewards for good behaviour.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN PROIESSOR WEBSTER'S CASE. \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd We have just learned some facts which go far to show the utter falsity of Ptofessor Webster's confession as to the disposition of Dr. Parkman's body, and by which he attempted to show his want of premeditation in the killing. A student at the Medical College has this morning, for the first time, disclosed that. at the time of the mu-der, while he was in the dissecting room eiitiy, be distinctly heard J sounds of something being dragged over the stairs leading to Piofessor Webster's lower luboratory, which he has now, no doubt were thus produced by the dr-scent of Dr. Parkman's body. An examina tior. of the Slllk in the upper laboiatoi v. described by Piofessor W ebster as the one he used for the dis- memberment of lie bodv, demonsuans its positive incapacity for the purpose, it being of very small size.

There is not the re- mo'est probability that either Lord Ft-ddmg or Mr. Lefevie will be candidates; the latter, it is well known, was (Jnly placed in his position on the poll at the last election by a coalition wnh Mr. Goulbuin, or rather, perhaps, by the exchange of split votes with the latter, and. in addition, has since accepted an office which disqualifies him. The wriier has good authority for stating that Lord Fsilding has positively declined, as has also the Marquis of Gtanby, who was solicited by some of the few resident members of the senate. On Lord Feildmg declining, a deputa- tion was sent to the noble marquis, who IS vIsiting in Derbyshire with the Duke of Rutland and Lord Stan- ley, but with a like result, and the matter has now been allowed to res: until other influential parlies now enjoying the vacation return to Cambridge, and until that time all must necessarily be mere smmise.

Woidsworth and ins wde were here, and as there was no sin in eating the owl, I ordered it lo be dressed and brought in, in the place of game that day at dinner. It was served up without the head, and a squat-looking fellow it was, about the s:ze of a large wild pigeCr but broader i:1 proportion to his length. The meat was more like bad mutton than anything else. Wordsworth was not valiant enough to taste it. Mrs. W. did. and we agreed that there could he no pre- text for making owls game and killing them as deli- cacies.

EXECUTION OF WILLIAM ROSS.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThis unfortu. nate man, condemned for poisuni/lg his wife, whO died on the 31st of May last, at Roughtown, oil the borders of Yoikshire and Lancashire, was executed on Satniday morning at York. It may be recollected that shortly afier his conviction memorials on bis be- half were signed in Roughtown, Mossley, and also in the city of York, praying that the Secietaiy of State would stay the execution. Some statements alleged to have been made by some of the witnesses for the prosecution, tending to the supposition that the con- lc demned man was innocent, having been made public through the medium of the press, an investigation took place, the result of which was not favourable to the prisoner. On Friday evening the chaplain was in Company with the unhappy man until a late hour, and on his departure he still maintained that he was not guilty of the crime imputed to him. Ross was removed next morning al six o'clock from the con- demned cell to a room adjollling the pbce cf execu- tion. In this apartment he remained until within a short space of his death, when ihe sacrament was ad- mmisteied to him, and lie seen,ed resigned to his fate. He walked wnh a firm step on lo the drop, and d e(! in the space of two minutes. Since his con- demnation the prisoner had had seveir.i epileptic fits, and tie experienced a repetition ufthe-entt.)cks on the morning cf the execution, becoming very violent in his condict. In a short time, however, he became calm ar.d composed, and remained in that state up to the tnDe of his death. Ross maintained his inno- cence to the last, and just before he appeared on the seahold lie declared tv.ost earnestly that he vas not guilty of the murder of his wife. The number of spectators was not so large as usual, there not being more than between 3,000 and 4,000 peisons present to witness the dreadful spectacle.

A new and highly-int.eristing feature will immediately be introduced into rnHE WORKING MAN'S FRIEND, and FAMILY INSTRUCTOR, as will be seen by the follow- L ing- announcement: \u00e2\ufffd\ufffd Jorf CASSELL offers One Hundred Pounds, in Premiums of Ten Pounds each, for Ten pithy Sketches, Tales, or Narratives, illustrative of the Trials, Suffering's, and Patient Endurance of the Industrial Classes, in connexion with various systems. In order that no delay may occur in the publication of this important and interesting Series of Papers, the subject, \"Ox THE CONDITION OF THE OMNIBUS DRIVERS AND CONDUCTORS OF tHE METROPOLIS,\" has been submitted to and accepted by, Miss Meteyard (beteer knou n to the literary world us \"Silverpen\"), the first chapter of which will appear in the number of The WORKING MAN'S FRIEN ]),' to be issued August 3. The whole of the remaining snbjtcts ( Ten in number) will be open to the competition of all writers in the United Kingdom. I. THE SWEATING SY'STEM: in connection with the Tailoring'Trade. II. THE FACTORY' SYSTEM as illustrated in the Life of a Child, a Wife, and a Mother; in connection with long hours, absence from home, and bare subsistence. III. JOURNEYMEN BAKERS: in connection with long-hours, night work, Sunday labour, and close and unhealthy atmospheres. IV. COLLIERS AND MINERS: their unhealthy and hazardous employments; and the triumphs of virtue and religion under the most unfavourable circumstances. V. THE STOCK IN G ERS OF LEICESTER AND NOTTS: illustrated in the hi-tory oftbeir trade; their privations during a lengthened depression their long' hours of labour, and scanty wag-es. VI. NEEDLE WOMEN: illustrative of the suffering's and miseries of Shirt-makers, and the makers of Slop- goods, ke. VII. SALE FURNITURE AND CABINET MAKERS: with their drudg-ery, slavery, and very inadequate remuneration of the present system. VIII.

And, in connection with the above Series, though not actually including the Operative Classes:\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd X. THE DRAPERS' ASSISTANTS: illustrative of life in large towns, long hours, unhealthy lodg-ing\", oppres- sive and (iegradinw rules and maxims, and the demoralization usually attendant on the present system. Each Sketch, or Tale, must not exceed in length twelve of the ordinary pages of THE WORKING MAN'S FRIEND, and is to be divided into three chapters, or smaller sections, if necessary. Though written in the form of tale, or narrative, it must describe the peculiarities of the respective trade or occupation, and contain such statis- tics as may convey just ideas of its extent, importance, and present state. The Object of the Proprietor of THE WORKING MAN'S FRIEND, in publishing these Sketches, is to furnish a succession of vivid pictures, which may serve,- Fil-st,-To exhibit the advantages resulting from Sobriety, Industry, Integrity, and Moral Excellence, under the most trying circumstances\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdnamely, of the hardest work and the worst pay. Secondly,-To excite the sympathy of those who are in more favourable circumstances, by bringing- more fully before their view, the privations and suffering's which large portions of the operative community have to endure aud the great difficulties with which they have to contend, even in obtaining- the commonest necessaries of life, and in procuring the education and training- of their children and the temptations and dangers to which they are, consequently, exposed. Ti, irily,-To remove the prejudices, to allay the apprehensions, and to engage the kindly offices of those who have formed unfavourable opinions of the masses, as persons who have imbibed what are considered extravagant opinions and unwarrantable desires, as to Politics, Religion, and Social Philosophy and Finally,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdTo excite in the minds of all 'an earnest desire for the amelioration of the condition of the toiling classes, and a determination to employ the most rational means of securing their physical, intellectual, social, and moral elevation. The aim of each writer must be to carry out these objects in a calm and dignified tone, apart from personal invective, or abuse of individuals whom bad system may have betrayed into oppressive acts. It will not avail to irritate wounds that are already too g-rievous to be borne: the wisest course will be to point out the means by which fiealiii- and soundness may be best effected. j The Elitors of THE WORKING MAN'S FRIEND will be assisted in the selection of the best Sketch, Narrative, or Tale, by persons well acquainted with the peculiarities of each system. The competitors for No. 1. must send in their papers not later than August 14. For No. II. September 1 For No. IV. October 1. For No. III. September 15. For No. V. October 15. And the remainder not later than November 15. The Papers must be addressed To the Proprietor of The Working\" Man's Friend, 335, Strand, London.\" Each Manuscript must be signed with some peculiar initial, accompanied with a sealed note containing- the real name and address of the Writer; no note will be opened except that of the successful Competitor. The unaccepted Manuscripts will be returned to the Writers and the strictest impartiality will be observed in the adjudication. The THIRD Volume of the WORKING MAN'S FRIEND AND FAMILY INSTRUCTOR will be com- menced on Saturday, July 6. In addition to the continuation of papers by Dr. Ferguson, the Rev. B.

To which will added an Appendix. By the Rev. SAMUEL G. GREEN, A.B., of Taunton. London: JOHN SNOW, Paternoster-row- A Prize of Fifty Pounds was offered by Mr. JohiijCassell, for the best Essay upon the above subject, the adju- jmutators l eing the Rev. T. Spencer, A.M.; Edward Mial, Esq and Edward Swaine, Esq and was unanimously awarded to the above gentleman, his Essay being selected from almost fifty others. TOHN CASSELL'S BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdThere are Primers, Spelling. Books, Grammars, and and other helps to Elementary Education in abundance. There are also Libraries of Fairy Tales, Ro- mances, and other Works of Fiction, for the amusement of youthful readers, almost without end. But there are still wanting' cheap, well-written Books, adapted to the capacities of Children, and furnishing information as to Natural Objects, Arts, Sciences and Manufacturers. To supply this want, John Cassell proposes to issue A NEW SERIES OF INSTRUCTIVE WORKS FOR CHILDREN: To consist of Twelve Books at Sixpenee each, in the form of catechisms or dialogues, divided into sections, and written in a style at once plain and familiar, interesting' and instructive. The aim in this series will be, by judi- cious condensation, to furnish for the youthful mind such a store of information as shall prove of avail in after-life, at the same time that it excltes a spirit of laudable inquiry, and an eager thirst for the higher branches of intel- lectual, scientific, and moral truth. It is believed that there are few parents, however humble their lot in life, but will feel pleasure in presenting to their children a copy of each of these books as they make their appearance in succession. For use in schools, \u00e2\ufffd\u00a0whether public or private, they cannot fail to be acceptable. They will, also, be admirably adapted for presents, either as tokens of esteem or rewards for good behaviour. The First of the Series will be ready by the 1st of August next, and will contain ARTS' AND MANUFACTURES. NO. I. THE HISTORY OF PAPER MAKING, WRITING, PRINTING, AND BOOKS. Each Number, or Book, will be complete in itself. THE CHEAPEST WORKS OF STERLING VALUE EVER ISSUED FROM THE PRESS.

NEW AND POPULAR HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

In publishing these Volumes the design will be, not only to exhibit a mere record of the actions of King-s, but also to present a more faithful and interesting history of the People, with their progress in industrial arts and social amelioration. The acknowledged talents and celebrity of the respective authors of these works will be a I., sufficient guarantee for the ability and excellence with which they will be prepared. rpiIE STANDARD OF FREEDOM, JOHN CASSELL., Proprietor.

Mr. Cockburn, Sir,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdHaving been recommended to make a trial of your Botanical Preparation, I purchased of my townsman, Mr. Ferris, Union-street, a small bottle of the Extract, to remove a great many eruptions and freckles on my skin, and which I can only say with thanks to you and pleasure to myself, exceeded my most sanguine expectations, for in a few days I saw a g-reat change, and I had, before using your excellent remedy, reported to several things advertised, but with- out deriving- the least good. And for the benefit I have received from your Extract, I shall not, Sir, feel any hesitation in answering' any enquiries or references you may please to make. Thanking you once again.

I was, Sir, previous to using it, troubled with a great many spots and eruptions on my skin, but I am most pleased to say that after a few applications of your Extract, according to your direc- tions, that every unpleasant appearance forsook my skin, and in a very short space of time a perfect cure was made. I shall not feel any objection if you think proper to make this public, and I have the honour to be, Sir, yours most respectfully, C. A. SEYIIIOUR. Copy of a letter received March 19, 1850.

Dear Sir,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdI should feel ungrateful after the service I have received by the use of your Oriental Extract, did I not thank you for the same I have to inform you that seeing it advertised in several Liverpool newspa- pers, I was pursuaded by a friend to try it, although at that time I felt assured it would only be a waste of money and trouble, having- had recourse to so many things before, without doing me the least good, but at last I determined to give it a trial, and accordingly ob- toined a 2s. 9d. bottle from Messrs. Eyre and Co., Seel- street, one of your agents in this town, and I can only say with much pleasure, that after a few applications, I perceived a pleasing change, and in a short time, a perfect cure was the result, for which I beg you to ac- cept my best thanks.

In the prevention and removal of the foregoing symp\" toms, and as a restorative of manly vigour, whether deficient from early imprudence, or residence in hot climates, &c., this medicine has obtained an unparalleded popularity. From its properties in removing leucorrhoea or whites, headache, giddiness, indigestion, palpitation of the heart, dry coug'h, lowness of spirits, barrenness, and all disorders of FEMALES, it is admirably adapted to that class of sufferers, as it not only purifies and strengthens the whole system, but it creates new, pure and rich blood, and soon restores the invalid to sound health even after all other remedies (which have usually a depress- ing tendency) have failed in this lies the grand secret of its universal success.

I had consulted several eminent Doctors, who, after doing what they could for me, stated that they consid ered my case as hope- less. I ought to say that I had been suffering from a Liver and Stomach complaint of long standing, which duiing the last two ycais got so much worse, that every one considered my condition as hopeless. I as a last resource got a box of your Pills, which soon gave relief, and by persevering in their use for some weeks, together with rubbing night and morning your Ointment over my chest and stomach, and right side, I have by their means alone got completely cured, and to the ast, nishment of myself and every body who knows-me, (Signed) MAT HEW HARVEY, cUlm OF A CAgE OF WEAKNESS AND DE- BILITY, OF FOUn.

One day\" being unusually ill and in a dejected state, I saw your Pills advertised, and resolved to give them a trial, more perhaps from curiosity than with a hope of being cured, however I soon found myself better by taking them, an,1 so I went on per- severing in their use for six months, when I am happy to say they J effected a pet feet cure.

The diminution of the Mussulman population in Asia Minor is alarming. Between Tockat and Broussa I found villages almost entirely abandoned by the inhabitants, in consequence of the severity with which the recruiting for the Nirzam, the Turkish regular troops, is conducted in this part of the country. It would be an interesting study to seek o-it all the causes which contribute to the dreadful mortality which prevails amongst the young Turkish soldiers. The food which is distributed to the garrisons is of sufficiently good quality, and contagious maladies have been unknown to Turkey in Europe dur- ing the last five years. Some European physicians are of opinion that these young soldiers, not being married like the ancient Janissaries, abandon themselves to in- famous vices, and so destroy their constitution. But whatever may be the cause of this mortality, the conse- quence is the ever-increasing weakness of the Turkish empire. The fact is nowhere more perceptible than in the interior of Asia Milwr, whence the greater number of conscripts are drawn in Constantinople, At present several extensive villages are to be seen in Anotolia from which all the young men have been withdrawn.

The above Extract will be found, after every other means have been tried, the only remedy that can with safety be relied upon, and applied without the least inconvenience for effectually removing all Blotches, Freckles, Pimples, Tan Spots, and restoring the Complexion to its natural bloom of health. The application of the Oriental Botanical Extract is of a most agreeable nature, and after once or twice using a pleasing change will at once he perceived, and in a few days the complexion will assume a delightful roseate and youthful appearance, and prove its surprising efficacy. The preparation will be found highly beneficial in preserving the complexion from the disagreeable appear- ance it often presents from exposure to the sea air, and also frequent recourse to bathing, and the Oriental Botanical Extract is especially recommended to be used immediately after by all persons who are in any way troubled with cutaneous eruptions, and who resort to salt water remedies.. Dr. Cockburn can with great satisfaction add, and also prove by thousands of testimonials received by him from all parts of the kingdom, that the surprising and soothing qualities of the Oriental Botanical Extract knows no equal, and has never once been found to fail, but after various other quack and ruinous remedies for the complexion had been resorted to without deriving any benefit, but in many cases causing the patient great trouble and expense, the Oriental Hotanical Extract triumphed in a complete and permanent cure.

I have to state, that seeing it advertised in several Liverpool papers, I was persuaded to try it, although I felt at the time it would be only a waste of money and trouble, having had so many things before, and without doing me the least good; but at last I determined to give it a fair trial, and accordingly obtained a 2s. 9d. bottle from Messrs.

IF MANKIND are iiable to one Disease more than another, or if there are particular Affections of the Hu- man Body we require to have a knowledge of over the rest, it is certainly that clas of Disorders treated of in the New Improved Edition of the SILENT FKIEND. The Authors, in thus sending forth to the world another Edition of their Medical Work, cannot refrain from expressing their gratification at the continual success attending their efforts, which, combined with the assist- ance of Medicines, exclusively of their own preparation, have been the happy cause of mitigating anu averting the Mental and Physical miseries attendant on those peculiar Disorders thus proving the fact, that sufFeiint humanity must always dejive the greatest advantages from duly qualified Members of the Medical Profession, adopting a particular class of disorders for their exclusive study, in preference to a superficial knowledge of all the diseases that affect Mankind. MesHs. It. & L.

Illustrated with 26 Anatomical Coloured Engravings on Steel, ON PHYSICAL DISQUALIFICATIONS, GE- NERATIVE INCAPACITY, & IMPEDIMENTS TO MARRIAGE. THE SILENT FRIEND.\" A New Edition, enlarged to 196 Pages, Price 2s. Gd. In order to ensure secrecy, and punctuality in delivery, the Work will be sent direct from the Establishment, free to any part of the kingdom, in a sealed envelope, on the receipt of 3s. 6d. in postage stamps. rpHE SILENT FRIEND is a Medical Work, written JL in language devoid of professional technicalities, on the physical disqualiifcations affecting the generative system in both sexes. It contains an elaborate and careful ly- written account of the anatomy and physiology of the organs in man which are directly and indirectly concerned in the function of generation, (illustrated by coloured engravings) and the causes and consequences resulting from the baneful practice by which the vigour and manliness of life are enervated and destroyed, even before nature has fully established the power and sta- mina of the constitution, local and general debility, nervous irritability and excitement, consumption, indi- gestion of the most fearful and exhausting kind, in- tense melancholy and depression of the spirits, and par- tial or complete extinction of the reproductive powers, &c., are thus produced. In the Silent Friend, the chapter devoted to the consideration of these dreadful complaints contains also an account of the means by which they may be prevented and removed, so as to restore the sufferer to the enjoyment of health and the functions of manhood. The consequences icsulting from venereal contamina- tion are next pointed out, and the nature and character ofgonorrhcua, gleet, stricture, and secondary symptoms of every kind are clearly explained, with directions for cure. Their dangerous effects on human economy are sufficiently dilated on, and a means is also indicated by which the recurrence of these may in every instance be completely prevented. The work terminates with a chapter oil the obligations cf marriage, the physical impediments which tend to disqualify the candidate for that holy estate, and the directions necessary for their removal. The work is illustrated by the detail of cases, and by 126 coloured engravings on steel, thus rendering it what its name purports to be, the true but silent friend of al I suffering from the consequences of early error and Tic -a work which may be consulted without exposure, and with every assurance of complete success and benefit. By R. & L. PERRY, CONSULTING SURGEONS. Published by the Authors, and sold by Strange, 21 Paternoster-row, Hannay and Co., 63, Oxford-street; Sanger, 1511, Oxford-street; Gordon, 116, Leadenhall- street; Starie, 23, Titchborne-street, Ilaymaiket, Lon- don Newton, 16 and 19, Church-street, Liverpool;, liawle, Church-street, Liverpool; Ingram.

Lindsay, 11, Elms-row, Edinburgh; Powell, 10, Westmoreland-street, Dublin; and by all booksellers and patent medicine vendors in town and country. PART the first of this work is dedicated to the consi. deration of the anatomy and physiology of the genera- tive functions. It embraces a succinct account of all the organs in man which are engaged in the important func- tions of the reproduction of the species, and the mode in which self-abuse operates to the injury of the human frame, and the destruction of the social and vital powers. This is illustrated by six coloured engravings. PART the second treats of the infirmities and dccay of the system produced by over- iiidu igeiiee of the passions. The existence of nervous and sexual debility and inca- pacity, with their accompanying train of symptoms and disorders, are treated by the chain of connecting results to this cause. This section is illustrated by three co- loured engravings, which fully display the effects of physical decay. PAUT the third contains an accurate description of the diseases caused by infection, and by the abuse of mer. cury primary and secondary symptoms, eruptions of the skin, sore throat, inflammation of the eyes, disease of the bones, gonorrhoea, gleet, stricture, &c., are shown to depend on this cause. Advice for the treatment of all these diseases and their consequences is tendered in this section, which, if duly followed up, cannot fail in effect- ing a cure. The part is illustrated by seventeen coloured engravings. PAUT the fourth contains a Remedy for the Preven- tion of Diseases by a simple application, by which the danger of infection is obviated. Its action is simple but sure. It acts with the virus chemically, and destroys its power on the system. This important part of the Work should not escape the reader's notice. PART the fifth treats of Marriage, its obligations and disqualiifcations, The causes which lead to happiness in the marriage state are dwelt upon, and those which arc indicative of misery and domestic inquietude. The nature, origin, and treatment of physical disqualifica- tions are also described, and remedies for this state form an important consideration in this section of the work. The CORDIAL BALM of SAllI.\\CL:1f is expressly employed to renovate the impaired powers of life, when exhausted by the influence exerted by solitary indul- gence on the system. Its action is purely balsamic; its power in re-invigorating the frame in all cases of nervous and sexual debility, obstinate gleets, impotency, barren- ness, and debilities arising from venereal excesses, has been demonstrated by its unvarying success in thousands of cases. To those persons who are prevented entering the married state by the consequence of early errors it is invaluable. Constitutions relaxed, weak or decayed, trembling of the hands, head-ache, faintinga, and female complaints are under its immediate influence, and when the system has received a shock, and is debilitated from imprudence and inattention in the early part of life, or is sinking under the advance of years, or by long residence in hot or cold climates, this medicine will afford immediate assurance of returning strength, by giving tone to the muscular system and organs of digestion. All cases of loal and general debility, nervous irrita- bility and excitement, consumption, indigestion of the most fearful nnd exhausting kind, intense melancholy, depression of the spirits, partial or complete extinction of the reproductive powers, and non-retention of urine, are permanently cured by the CORDIAL BALM or SVKIA- CCM, and patients restored to the full enjoyment of health and functions of manhood.

Dr. DE LA MOTTE'S NUTRITIVE, HEALTH-RESTORING, AROMATIC CHOCOLATE, Prepared from the Nuts of the Sassafras Irpe. THIS CHOCOLATE contains the peculiar virtues of the Sassafras Root, which has been long held in B^eat estima- tion, for its purifying and alterative properties. Ihe aromatic quality (which is very grateful to the stomach) most invalids require for breakfast and evening repast, to promote digestion, and to a deficiency of this property in the customary breakfast and supper, may, in a great measure, be attributed the fre- quency of cases of indigestion generally termed bilious. It has been found highly beneficial in correcting the state of the digestive organs, &c., from whence arise many diseases, such as eruptions of the skin, gout, rheumatism, and scrofula In cases of debility of the stomach, and a sluggish state of the liver and intestines, occasioning flatulence, coetiveness, &c. and in spasmodic asthma, it is much recommended.

A very curious invention connected with Dental Surgery has been introduced by Mr. Howard it is the introduction of an Entirely New Description of Artificial leeth, fixed without springs, wires, or ligatures. They so perfectly resemble natural teeth, as not to be distinguished from the originals by the most intimate friend. They will never change colour or decay, and will be found very superior to any teeth ever before used.- This method does not require the extraction of roots, or any painful operation, and will support and preserve the teeth that are loose and is guaranteed to restore articulation and mastication. The invention deserves the notice of the scientific, and is of im. portance to many persons, and those who are interested in it. cannot do better than avail themselves of Mr. Howard s skill as a Dentist.

HAT ESTABLISHMENT, 2.9, HIGH-STREET, NEWPORT. R. BURKE, ENCOURAGED by the conviction derived from the fact of his increas- ing Trade, that the Public of Newport can appreciate a liberal system of business, is induced to venture with confidence upon a still more extended application of the principle; in furtherance of which his FHENCH HATS, at the respective prices of 7s. 6d., 10s., and 12s. 6d., will be found to possess qualities superior to any ever sold at the price in this town. In the selection of his present exten- sive and superior Stock of Hats, the greatest attention has been paid to com- prise assortments of all the Newest and most approved Shapes of the day; so that every diversity of individual taste may be met, whether as regards style or quality. From R. B 's practical knowledge and experience of the Manufacturing Department, he is enabled confidently to answer for the workmanship and quality of his goods; also to secure that purity of colour and cleanness of finish, so essential to the perfection of the French Hat. Gentlemen who may have been in the habit of obtaining their Chapeaux from London or Bristol, are respectfully invited to inspect the Goods at this Establish- ment; and they cannot fail to be convinced that money and trouble may be saved iu future. A choice selection of CHILDREN'S and YOUTHS' HATS, in the most fashionable styles,and suitable to all ages.

CAUTION.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdSutfereis are earnestly cautioned against youthful imprudent quacks, who, for obvious reasons, adopt a plurality of names and addresses, copy this announcement, forge testimo- nials, place ])r. before their names, make assertions the most extravagant and absurd, and have recourse to the basest prac- tices, to victimize the public. EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS OF THE NEW REMEDY, Which hIS never been known to fail. A cure effected or the money returned. DR. DE ROOS' CONCENTRATED GUTT/E VIT.F. has, in all instances, proved a speedy and permanent cute for every variety of disease arising from solitary habits, youthful delusive excesses, and infection, such as gonorihoea, sypluliis, &c., which, fiom neglect or improper treatment by mercuiy, copaiba, cubebs, and other deadly poisons. invariably end in some ot the tollowing fornis of secondary symptoms, viz., pains and swellings in the bones, joints, and glands, skin eruptions. blotches, and pimples, weakness of the eyes, loss of bair, disease and decay of the nose, sore throats, pains in the side, back, ind loins, fistula, piles, &c., diseases of the kidneys and bladder, gleet, stricture, beininal weakness, nervous and sexual debility, loss of memory,and finally such a state of drowsiness, lassiiude, and general jirostration \"f strength, as, unless skilfully arrested, soon ends in a miserable death. In ttiepi-el,etition and removal of the foregoint: symptoms, and as a restorative of manly vigour, whellier deficient from early imprudence, or residence in hot climates, &c., this medicine has obtained an unparalleled popularity. From its properties in removing leucorihoea or whites, head- ache, giddiness, indigestion, palpitation of the heart, dry cough, lowuess of spirits, barrenness, and all disorders of FEMALES, it is admirably adapted to that class of sufferers, as it not only purifies and strengthens the whole system, but it ciesies new, pure, and rich blood, and soon restuies the invalid to sound health, even after all other remedies (which have usually a do. pressing tendency) have tailed. In this lies the grand seciet of its universal success. Sent,securely packed, to any part,from the establishment only, price 1 Is. per Bottle, or four quantities in one large Uotlle fur 3J.,i., with full instructions for use, on receipt of the amount by Post Office Order, payable at the Holborn Office.

Lasting benefit can only be reasonably expected at the hands of the duly qualified practitioner, who, departing from the routine of general practice, devotes Ihe whole of his studies to this class of diseases, the lamentable neglect of which, by or- dinary medical men, and their lutile attempts at cure by Mer- cury and other equally dangerous Medicines, have produced the most alarming results. Suflereis are invited to apply at once to Dr. DE R. who guarantees a speedy and perfect cure of every symptom without hindrance from business, change of diet, &c., in comparatively few days, or return the money.
