Witton Davies, Tl N.A., interposed to deliver his address. ith He, in the course of his remarks, in- si- dulged in reminiscences of the Eji- i's teddfod of Middlesbrough. The last rY he bad attended was as a juvenile corn- h1, petitor. He had been interested, too, i-in the Witton Park Eisteddfod, which og was held on alternate years -to,.:iddles- ry brough.

That was Miss Lillian Price, of South Bank. LTer ago was said to l*e ten but she looked little mere than a baby, end the perfect ease and selfpoeses-on with whi.-h the little mite faced the vast audience*, and the almost faultless rendering slie gave of the sung in \\Selsh, charmed everyone, and the anr>{au*\u00abe whioh greetoa ?? ?? 6f ber eflfon was __ff>c-gom The adjudicator spoke h 'ghly of her effort, and had no hesitation in awarding her the prize. For the choral competition for from 20 to oU female voices, not under 16 years of ago, there was but one entry, that being tlio -lieklke- brough Ladiea' Choir, conducted by Mr Thomas Nicholas. The test pieces were Dr. Cooke's arranged by Mr D. E. Evans, tho former w-.th- \u25a0'\" \u00bb \u0084c ' \" v <\"\u25a0 ' \" ! xr \u00ab -v <Ki\\, and the luttrr with accompanmeiu. Uoth items werewell rendered, and the adjudicator did not hesitate to award tlie prize of \u00a36, given by Mr David Evans. For the tenor solo, \"My hope is in the Everlasting\" (Stainer) there were wero 13 competitors, of whom two were selected, and of these Mr John Davies, of Middle- brough, proved successful. It waa nouce-able, however, that the exceptional profusion of good tenors which a former adjudicator remarked upon seems to have disappeared, as neither the tenor solos nor the tenor parts in the chorm-exs were of a high, order of merit. The soprano, alto, toner, and ba?.\u00ab quartet found three contestants, though only one party presented themselves for the public test. This was the Cymric quartet of S >uth Bank, to whom tho prize was awarded, the test piece being Evans* song, ' ; My leve is like the red rose.\" without accompaniment. Six competitors presented themselves for the contralto solo com- petition, the test piece be ng \" The promised land \" (Lloyd), and of .hese two were selected, tlie prizo being eventually awarded to Mk_ Lottie Thomas, of South Bank. The ?? for the violin solo for competitors from ?? >\u00ab. 16 years of age was awarded to Mkss A. 151- ?? cf Mid- d'esbrough, tho adjudicator, in ;*w .-ding the prize, warmly commending the* iutroduekon of instrumental music into the competitions. The \" piece de rea stance \" of tho whole evening seemed to be the choral competition for from 20 to 30 male voices. Tiie test pieces were Prother^e's \"Roman Soldiers\" and Schubert's \"Gondolier's Serenade.\" The competing oho'rs wore the Middlesbrongh Ex- celsior Male Voice Choir, conducted by Mr W. H. Day; tho South Bank Male Vcioo Choi*, conducted by Mr Thos. Jones; and tho Cleveland Harmonic Male Ycico Choir, conducted by Mr M. Re\u2014 i. All these choirs sang excel- lently, but unhappily for them the __ t-named o'.mir ma'! 3 a blunder in tho middle of one of tho pieces, and though the mistake was at once rec- tified and the choir Eang splendidly to the end, it ro\u00abt them the first prize. Had it not been for this, the adjudicator said, he would have had uo hesitation in awarding them to prize, as they were decidedly ?? best choir. He must, however, take ihe competition as lie found it, and awarded tho South Bank Choir aud the Cleveland Har- monic Choir, 36 marks each out of 40. and divided the prize between them. The decision was re- ceived with loud applause, though many present would have liked a rehearing. On the motion of Dr. Edwards, seconded by Mr E. T. John, a hearty vote of thanks was accta rded to the president, and a most successful gathe-mr was Kr-ought to a close by the audience singing the Welsh and the English National Anthems, led by Miss John.

The gathering from every point of view proved one of tiie most successful yet an_ oged by ti io Society. The organisers of this annual festival havo every reason for ocngr&tulation upon the important petition which the Eisteddfod has obtained amongst musicians in Cleveland and Durham, and upon tiie valuablo infiucn ce it has exerted upon the mi/_ .ca l taste _ ::d culiure of the district throughout which its in fiuencc is felt. Those who n member tho earlier \u25a0 and humbler days of tho society and tha Eisteddfod could not refrain from a feeling of prido and p-eas-iire as they looked at tlio crowded audi<_<ce which afternoon and evening i\u2014 ike packed tiie. Middlesbrough Town Hall. At iho some timo those v.iio were present at the re- hearsals could hardly fail lo marvel as singer after anger, j layer after player, or choir after choir came forward and gave their selection- Strange indeed, it would be if so much thought and training and practice in an art than which there is probably none mere elevatmg or en- nobling, failed to leave a decided mark upon the on lt\u2014 ie and refinement cf the people. Almost without exception those who faiied to win the prizes accepted tlicir defeat in the true spirit of loyalty to the Eisteddfod ideal and de- votion to the art they practise. As a rule, they were the first and heartiest eon gratulators of their successful rivals. In every ca.^e public opinion loyally and i-pontaneot\u2014 ly seconded tlie adjudicator's award, and it was pleasant to observe the cicsene-.'* with which the rudience followed the adjudicator's reasoning in coni-ng to his decision. Unfortun a ,tely lie fre- quently faded to make those at the very back of the hall liear, and some disappou ltment was consequently felt, but those who did hear fully appreciated tho reasons which he sot forward. From first to last the Eisteddfod was a gratifying success, and Welsh men and Welsh women in Cleveland and Durham have reason to be pr< ud of their achievements in this a_ in other direc- tions. A plea is being -sued on behalf of tho eld soldiers, numbering about 30, who reside in liailiiigton. These veterans, who have lived through many a hard-fought battle, have suf- fered tho intense heat of the Indian Mutiny, have lain in enow in tho trenches in the Grunea, have not had a jolly Christmas, unless they have joined some of their old comrades in the work- hou*\\ The pica is on their belralf. In all the hurry of this exciting time, reservists and men are being posted off to the front with the pleasing thought that those at home will be oared for. But what of the old men? They are worthy of somo thought, and what has been done in other years could be done again if tiie right maohinery were set to work. Major Prieatman, who took so large and substantial an interest in the fund which was promoted last year to entertain the veterans, would be glad to bear from anyone who will join bim in any form to raise funds to eat\u2014 .tain and clothe Darlington's old veterans. Tliere are quite a number of guns about the nattlepooLs, big guns and Utile guns, but fryja among them all there are two which may be said to play important parts in the affairs of the two towns. One is the time-gun, which goes bang every day \u2014 except Sunday \u2014 at one'clock. When it shoots, and raises the echoes all over the 'Pools, everybody who has a watch pulls it (the watch, not the gun) fioni lus pocket and ob- serves, with approval or dk <approval, whether it (the watch again) is right or wrong. One day not so long ago, the gun went off three minutes before its time, and as nobody suspected that it could be wrong there was such a commotion among the docks and watches of the Hartlepoo\u2014 i ai had never been heard of before. And the bother was that next day, when the gun went off at the proper time, tiie ticke-3 had all to be altered agaii v But, except for suoh slips once in a lc_ g while, tiie gun keeps verj' slo.idy, and be- oautie of its regularity and loud reverberation, the Weet Hartlepool authorities think they can do very well without a town clock. The other gun referred to ie a big one, and when it is fired \u2014 which happily is not often \u2014 it makes tlie heait of aJJ the glaziers in Hartlepool glad by smashing windows right and left. It is very seldom been. It is too precious. The military authorities keep dt care- fully hidden from si glit _ iside the Lighthouse Battery, and when inquisitive i>eoplo mount the lighthouse in the hope of hawing a look at it they see nothing but the placo it fires from. It ie a ip-rvellously well-hidden gun. But although it can't be _een often, it can bo heard \u2014 and the readente an the Cliff at Hartlc]>ool are so in- censed at it for the commotion it makes that they scathingly refer to it i_ \"that __serable gun.\" One of them quite recently, since tiie need for guns on the Modder River and at tiie Tugela liecame so pressing, made the brilliant sugges- tian^ tliat it should be mounted on a suitable carnage and cent to Afn'ca. Ho thinks that if it jarred the nerves of the Boers half _j much as it disturbs those of the good people of Hartle- pool, there would be very Httle fight left in tliem. But perhaps if one of Oom Paul's privateers made a dash for the 'Pools some of tbeso fine mornings with a view to holding tiie towns and tiie ships as ransom, quite a d fferent opinion would spring up as to the usefulness of \"that wretched gun.\" The third aid fiu\\l part of the new edilicn of the \"Darlington Half-Holiday Guide,\" pub- lished by Messrs Dresser and Sons, High-row, Darlington, has n< w beau put into the liaritls cf the subscribers, and is on sale. The publication, which is a dettiied and elaborate revision of the \"HalF Holiday Guide,\" published in 1882, by Mr Wm. Jno.

Waylen, distriot coroner, touching the death of Arthur Woobridge, aged 31, platelayer, a native of ]East Garston, Berks, who had been working on the now Stert-Westbury line, and who met with his death in a particularly shocking manner. Deceased, who was a single man, was in the Clock beerhouse at Lydeway on the evening of Christmas Day, and was in a room which was heated by means of a paraffin stove, which was placed on the mantelpiece. Deceased was left in the room by himself for a minute or two, and on ?? a crash the landlord (Mr Hiscock) ran in and found deceased on his knees enveloped in flames with the stove on the iloor, The fire was extinguished as speedily as possible, and deceased was got to bed. Dr Haynes was sent for, and he at once dressed the wounds, which were very extensive. The man was eventually removed to the Devizes Hospital, where he only lingered a short time. There was no direct evidence as to how the occur- rence happened, but deceased told the matron at the hospital that he tried to lift the stove up and let it fall. The jury returned a verdict of \" Accidental death.\" BACKWELL. The annual Christmas tea meeting and entertain- ment of the Blackwell branch of the C.E.T.S. was held in the Schoolroom on Friday. The weather was particularly unfavourable, aud consequently there wvpre not so many as usual present at the tea, but there was a larger attendance at the subsequent meeting and entertainment. The Rector (the Rev Prel'erdary Burbidge) presided. Mr Franoombe, St. Alay Redolill, gave an excellent address, whieh was listened to with much attention, and he was heartily applauded. Miss Boaden's songs were greatly en- joyced, Mr Hayward gave a pianoforte solo and accompanied, and there were part songs and a dialogue.

{"ocr": "MAJORITY AND MARRIAGE OF LORD CASTLEREAGH. PKbbbINIAIIUINb Al WYINYAKU. (From Our Own Reporter). It is a great and a proud privilege to be heir to :an historic name, immense fortune, and princely domains, but to succeed to the affection and respect with which all classes of the community have regarded your progenitors is even a prouder and a grander privilege than to be the inheritor of broad acres and untold wealth. To Viscount Castlereagh, eldest son of the Marquess and Mar- chioness of Londonderry, this dual privilege be- longs. Should he be spared to succed his father he will be the possessor of a splendid inheritance, he already possesses the high esteem and regard of his neighbours, no doubt, in some measure, because ; he is the son of his father, but chiefly on account jof his own estimable qualities. The occasion of j his attaining his majority, followed very quickly ;by his ha^py marriage gave his friends, his neigh- bours, his father's tenants, and dependents oppor- i tunities of showing, in a tangible manner, their affection for the House of Londonderry. The result of their efforts in this direction was to get together a superb collection of presents for the acceptance of the noble viscount. The intrinsic value 'of those presents would represent an enormous sum, but to Lord Castlereagh. no amount of money, however large, would adequately repre- sent their value ; they were the outcome of the wealth of loving hearts. The presentation would have taken place in August last, but for the acci- dent that befel Lord Castlereagh, and which cast such a gloom over what otherwise would have been one of the most brilliant and happy functions that had ever taken place in connection with the noble family. The postponement, however, was inevit- able, and the event, shorn doubtless of a great deal : of its brilliance, but none the less gratifying to the recipient of the gifts, took place on Saturday last in Wynyard Hall, in the presence of the Marquess and Marchioness of London- derry, Lady Helen Stewart, and Lady Aline Beaumont. The Viscountess Castlereagh was, un- fortunately, unable to be present owing to slight indisposition. The presents were displayed in the Statue Gallery. They made a magnificent show, but perhaps the cheif attraction was the glass case containing the jewels presented to the bride and bridegroom. They included a ruby, diamond, and emerald true lovers' knot brooch with two drop pearls to Lady Castlereagh , and a turquoise and diamond horseshoe pin to Lord Castlereagh, from the Prince and Princess of Wales ; a ruby and dia- mond tiara, scroll, and eollette, formi\u00bb\u00bb \u00ab\u25a0 neck- lace, a ruby and diamond ahwter and scroll comb, a ruby aw\u00bb <K.tinOhd cluster and scroll bracelet, and\" a pair of ruby and diamond cluster eardrops, from the Marquis and Marchioness of London- derry ; enamel, pearl, and diamond scroll eollette and pendant, the Duke of Westminster ; a seven- teen row pearl collar with four diamond scroll bars and snap, the Duke of Sutherland ; some beautiful articles of jewellery presented by the Right Hon. 11. Chaplin, M.P., the bride's father, including a painted blue enamel pendant and pair of ear- drops presented to the late Lady Florence Chaplin by the late Earl of Beaconsfield ; pearl and dia- mond cluster brooch, the Marchioness of London- derry ; a diamond crescent brooch and a diamond cluster marquise ring, Viscount Castlereagh ; pearl and diamond cluster earrings.Lady Helen Stewart ; tuquoise and diamond half hoop bracelet, Dowager Marchioness of Londonderry ; a diamond and sapphire half hoop bracelet, Lord Rosebery ; and other magnificent articles from \u2022various friends. Tlie presents had been arranged with considerable skill by Mr. W. Milson, who took charge of the display of presents at Stafford House, London. The tother presents included several very beautiful ilhtniinated addresses, ail expressive of that intense affection which the Londonderry family have gained for themselves by their uniform courtesy, kindness of heart, and liberality. The deputa- tions from the various bod if * making the gifts were introduced to Lord Castlereagh by Mr. N. W. Apperley. Mr. H. B. Wright was the spokesman for the first deputation, who were from the inhabitants and tradespeople of Seaham Harbour. Mr. Wright, in asking his lordship's acceptance of a superb silver salver, Armada jug, and album con- taining the names of the subscribers, said that he need not remind him of the close and intimate con- nection which subsisted, and had so subsisted, be- tween the inhabitants of Seaham Harbour and his lordship's family, a connection which occasioned the deepest interest on the part of the inhabitants of Seaham, and their domestic and public life. The feeling of interest in his lordship's atainin? his majority had found expression in those gifts, the subscribers to which comprised all classes and all shades of politics, and what, he was sure, would prove especially pleasing to Lord Castlereagh, the names included those of a great majority of all the industrial classes connected with the town. Mr. Corbett, on behalf of the Londonderry agents, officials, and general staff, presented Ms lordship with a handsomely fitted dressing case, and wished, on behalf of those whom he represent- ed and himself, every happiness and long lives to Lord and Lady Castlereagh. Mr. W. Warham, on behalf of the same body, presented his lord- ship with an illuminated addresas. The tradespeople of Stockton-on-Tees sent a splendid silver casket, which was presented to his lordship on their behalf by the Mayor of Stockton (Councillor Nightscales). His Worship said that be hoped Lord Castlereagh would accept r'h-e gift in the same spirit in which the subscribers had contributed towards it. Mr. W. Smith, on behalf of the Longnewton tenantry, presented an illuminated address assur- ing his lordship of their hearty congratulations on his recovery and on his recent marriage, hoping that he and Lady Castlereagh would have long life, health, and happiness. They trusted that when many of them had passed away it might be said, \"the glory of the latter house exceeded that of the former. \" Mr. William Darling, the oldest of the Wynyard 'Park tenantry, on behalf of his brother tenants presented Lord Castlereagh with a silver inkstand and candlesticks, and in doing so said that they hoped his lordship would enjoy a long, happy, and prosperous life, for they had received the utmost kindness and consideration from the noble house of Londonderry. Mr. Potts was the representative of the North Durham tenantry. He asked his lordship to ac- cept a magnificent silver punch bowl, and expres- sed the pleasure they felt at knowing that Lord and Lady Castlereagh's future home would be at Wynyard. Mr. John Page was the spokesman of the depu- tation from the New Seaham Conservative Club, and presented his lordship with an illuminated ad- dress. Colnel Ropner was the representative of the Stockton Constitutional Association, and their present took the form of an illuminated address. tie congratulated his lordship on attaining his majority, and said the subscribers were animated with but one feeling and that was that he would have a long, happy, aud prosperous life. He could only say, speaking on behalf of the members of the Association, that if Lord Castlereagh only en- deared himself to the people of the neighbourhood as Lord and Lady Londonderry had done he would live in their hearts. He would always be popular and looked up to \u2014 not only as the leader of the party but as the leader of all of them in the county. He would at the same time like to congratulate Lord and Lady Castlereagh on their marriage, and hoped that they would be spared for many years to continue in happy and prosperous life Alderman W. F. Hall was the representative of the South-East Durham Conservative Association whos^ present was a magnificent chiming grand- father's clock. Alderman Hall said he was privi- leged to appear before them as the representative of the members of the South-East Durham Conser- vative Association, and wished to convey to his lordship their hearty congratulations on two happy ev * n ts. \u00ab his life\u2014 the attainment of his majority, and his fortunate marriage to a charming and bsautiful bride, to whom they give a hearty and JmT cordial welcome to the North of England .They begged his acceptance of a chiming clock as a lasting memorial of his coming of age. The Con- servatives of the County of Durham bad always j teen accustomed to look up to the head of tnc House of Londonderry as their leader in the North ! at Kiqrland, a position his honoured father now \u25a0 held with such conspicuous ability and acceptance I Ibe time would come (although they all hoped it might be long deferred) when his lordship would have to succeed to that position. He had in bis noble father and mother a splendid example. Their guiding principle, as they all knew, had been as ' much as possible, to do good unto all men, and in I political matters to cultivate such broad based opinions and independence of thought as to win ad- ' miration even from their opponents. They felt ' sure that he would worthily follow in their foot- steps. Alderman Hall expressed on his own be- half and also on behalf of the members of the As- sociation, the hope that long life, health, andeverv happiness will be the portion of Lord and Lady Castlereagh. * The West Hartlepool Constitutional Associa- tion sent an ?? address, the presenta- tion being made on their behalf by Mr. T. Au- Mr. Errington Huntley,, on behalf on the Sun- .derland Conservative Association and Primrose League, presented Lord Castlereagh with a splen- ' did silver vase and said that his lordship's recent \u25a0 presence amongst the townspeople had given them 'great pleasure. i-k ?fe \u00ae' Pearc * w \u00bbs the spokesman of the Darlmgton Chamber of Agriculture. He said I that the Chamber was formed in 1884, and at that tune his lordship's father, then Viscount Castle- reagh, was the president. His lordship was presi- dent last year so that they had had the honour of having two Lord Castlereaghs as president. I Major Mackenzie on behalf of the officers of the 2nd Durham (Seaham) Artillery Volunteers hand- ed to Lord Castlereagh a beautiful silver cigar box | Mr. W. Cummings was the representative of the j deputation from the Stockton, Hartlepool* Cyclinjr Clubs, attending the Wynyard annual Church parade, and they presented his lordship with a handsome silver cup. Mr. Cummings made the Eresentation in cyclists' language, expressing the ope that the wheels of his lordship's life would go merrily round and punctures ana spills be far : between. I The South Durham Hunt deputation consisted of | Messrs. T. Appleby, R. Ord, R. C. Denton, J. j W. Page, and C. J. Walton, and their present was ( a splendid travelling bag with silver fittings. Viscount Castlereagh, in reply, said : My kind friends, \u2014 I think lam studying your convenience if I venture to ask you to allow me in one speech to return my sincere thanks to the representatives | of the various bodies who have to-day done me so ! much honour. I wish it had been possible for me j to have expressed to each individual whom you, gentlemen, to-day represent, how deeply Lady Castlereagh and I feel, and shall never forget the I great kindness and expressions and goodwill you | have all collectively shown us on our marriage. I j have also to thank some here, whom I should have thanked in August last but for my unfortunate I accident, for the tangible proofs of your Goodwill j towards myself. Although, gentlemen, 1 am to- : day the fortunate recipient of these beautiful gifts I know well that your kind thought for me was prompted by the esteem in which you hold my dear j parents, and my earnest endeavour will be to fol- i low in their footsteps, and in some small way | deserve that place in your hearts, which I know it jis their good fortune to hold. The bodies you , represent are numerous and varied, my political agricultural, military, and sporting friends in this I county have all vied with one another in doing me ! honour, and I feel sure you will make some allow- : ance for me when I say that I am quite at a loss to find words to thank you. I shall never forget , this day, and in years to come I hope I shall prove by my endeavours to promote everything that can conduce to the welfare of the neighbourhood of my home, that I have done something to ?? some return for the unbounded kindness and generosity which yon h*ns this day displayed to- , wards m\u00bb- (Applause.) It would have given me [ additional pleasure if Lady Castlereagh could have been here to join with me in expressing our deep j gratitude to you for the hearty welcome we have j received at your hands. (Loud applause). At the conclusion of the presentations the depu- | tations from tlie various bodies were entertained at i luncheon, covers being laid for 100 guests in the big dining-room, j In the afternoon, the estate employees and , school children were afforded on opportunity of j seeing tlie presents, and further presentations were made to Lord Castlereagh. *i r Y D /, f ' Me iklejohn (estate agent), speaking on behalf of the households of Wynyard, Seaham, Mount Stewart, and Londonderry, presented Lord ! Castlereagh with a handsome antique Dutch writing table, and chair to match, and assured him and Lady Castlereagh of their very deep affection and esteem. Mr. H. E. Gribble (head gardener), on behalf of the Wynyard employees, asked Lord Castle- reagh s acceptance of a silver salver, which was an earnest of their good feeling to Lady Castle- reagh and himself. Lord Castlereagh, in reply, said: My kind friends, Mr. Meiklejohn, and Mr. Gribble, in far too flattering terms have given expression to the kindly feelings you entertain towards Lady Castle- reagh and myself. On behalf of her, as well as el myself, I would tend to you our most sincere thanks. You have given us, in the shape of these beautiful presents, a most practical proof of this kindly feeling, and whenever we use them, and use them we most frequently shall, we shall always be reminded of your generosity. I look round this large gathering of employees on this estate, and amongst them I see the many faces that I have known from my earliest childhood. It is more gratifying to think that as the years roll by the same familiar faces remain, and I can- rot but think that this goes to prove that those friendly relations which should exist between em- ployees, agents, and employers do so on this estate. (Hear, hear). I can only assure you it will be my earnest endeavour to assist my parents in maintaining those relations, and your kindly action of to-day, while strengthening those rela- tions will never. I assure you, be effaced from my memory. (Loud applause). Afterwards the employees were entertained to refreshments, and the children regaled to tea. Each child received a Christmas present.

English, of ay Station TIown, now serving in the 1st - Coldstream Guards, on active service in re- South Africa:- 3ir Modder River, Dec. 5th, 1899. he Dear Father and Mother,-It is with Bet the greatest pleasure I once more write ial a few lines hoping to find you all en- th joying good health, as this leaves me or- pretty well at present, thank God, 'he Well, we have had a very tough time as of it since I wrote last to you, and I l am very lucky indeed to have the plea e. sure of writing to you this day. We of have had three battles in five days. iat The first was at Belmont Hill, when i's we were firing as fast as we could for m- eight hours. Our artillery shelled th them first, and then we Guards ild chased up the hill and used our bayo- nd nets. At the finish there were heaps er of dead Boers lying amongst our feet. al It was a horrible sight. This took ies place on the morning ofthe 23rd. the a next battle was at Graspan on the on 25th. We put it into the Boers there as- and they sohn did a nip. The third 'de was at Modder Riveir on the 28th, and It that I shall never forget; we were fir- m- ing for over 12 hours. It was hard oflines when we had to see our chums n-hot down and still to press bn and at fight, all the while nearly dying for a in- drink. We laid jat an hour with bul- led lets flying about. It was most like a swarm of bees continually buzzing in about. The fighting commenced in the of morning, and silenced towards dark. or Then we continued lying in the trenches throughout the night until .edaybreak,he we advanced and took s possession of the town, fromn which tthe Boers 'had- fed by that time. If h ever I thought about home in my life .e it was then, and for saying prayers. I g said them over and over again, think- .r- ing every minute was to be my last. I dca only thank God that He saw me edthrough safely, and I hope 'and trust nd He will guide 'me through the next ehr battle, which will be a big one, and e takes place in a few days. It is said. arthe Boers are using a poisonous bul- nlI let, as it is all the same if you get od wounded it kills you. There is no doubt about' it they are a lot of cow- ,as. ardsf they fire on ouir hospital vans. ;hIf the Boers wave the flag of truce we ot- dare not tak 'any notice of it, but di- keep on firing, because at Belmont we ho stopped fring on sight of the flag, but oh when an officer went un to take therm ist prisoners they deliberately shot him do dead. At the last battle our General to was wounded, only slightly, but the re- commanding officer of the 2nd Cold- - stream Guards was shot dead. P.C. nd Miller, from Spennymoor, is in the 2nd ). Coldstreams, and as both Regiments re, are together, he and I are chumming it re- here- Miller is the only constable from l Durlam County out here. I am sorry ho I cannot be your first foot this year, he but wish you all a prosperous New to Year.-Your affectionate son, TED. In, in- S.S.F.A. NEEDLEWORK GUILD.

Flhe very bro , brighlt tone he adopts in uiscasoing t1 e dtbposi- not tion of bir tedvets Biller's troopa and their 1) approacting advance upon Ladysmuitlh cannot fail to be reassuring to woe general public.

The lst East Lanca- , is'iire Regiment have icceived numerous Rifts from that, county. A fund raised at Preston by the Mayor realised sufficient for the presentation to each man of half j a guinea, while a committee of ladies have provided the . iren with woollen jackets, caps, socks, and mufflers in addition to tobacco and pipes. The Coiporation of Jersey J have also, as a token of the good feeling existing in the is.cud towards the battalion, sent each man a pound of j tobaccj :;nd a pipe.

The Reservists ot the five Hussar regiments at the front, to the | number of about SUO, are to come to Aldershot for training an.l equipment. Ceiit-ial Montgomery-Moore, commanding the troops at Aldersliot, will this morniug inspect the following troops , going out immediately as reinforcements to South Africa: : 2nd Batt ??

The undermentioned troops will embark in the steam- I ship America at the Royal Albert Docks, Woolwich, to-day, j for convey ance to South Africa : Ammunition Column, j Sixth Division, five officers, one warrant officer, I'JS non- j commissioned officers and men, ?? ?? horses ; Mounted ! Infantry, Sixth Division, lst Pattaiion Royal Irish Regi- | incut, four officers. ?? uon-commis.-ioned officers and men, and IS. - ; horses ; detachments of the :>rd Divisional Field Hospital, and other details, making a total of 11 officers, one warrant officer, 2G7 non-commissioned officers and men, | and 27'> horses. A Poard of officers from Woolwich Garri-on made an official inspection yesterday of the steamship Assay c at the Royal Albert Docks, Woolwich, prior to the embarkation of troops going out in that vessel. Dei'ARTCOE or Amkui.ance Men. A great crowd assembled yesterday at Preston railway station to witness the departure of ambulance men who have been selected from No. 4 District St. John's Ambulance Brigade to proceed to Aldershot, their ultimate destination being South Afiica. Ahout 110 have been \u25a0elected fiom the North of England, and it is expected that a further call will be made on the Northern Brigade, military officers are at present in Preston putchasing all likely horses they can obtain. Arrival of Invalids. The Castle Line Company's steamer Garth Castle, from Capetown, which arrived at Plymouth yesterday, ha.i on board SG wounded aud sick soldiers from the troops now ber.eiged in Ladysmith. Private Creeman, Scots Fusiliers, died on board from double pneumonia at Las Palmas, and was buried at sea. Bubal Rifle Coops. Mr. J. Harris Sione, a barrister, speaking at St. Margaret's Parish Council, Kent, advocated the formation ct rille and artillery corps among the rural districts of the United Kingdom. He suggested that the village authori- ties should support the adoption of the movement by facili- tating the co-operatiou of neighbouring parishes in the enrolment of companies with headquarters in close proximity to the enlisting districts. Mr. Stone added that many exceptional marksmen among our rural population found it impossible to join existing local companies. He considered that the practicability of the scheme was beyond ijuestion and its success would be certain. Keeping their Berths Open. Five Huddersficld constables having been called on for duty with the colours, Mr. John Morton, the Chief Constable, with a view of keeping the men's places open and still maintaining the efficiency of the police force, has devised a scheme for employing police pensioners on day duty only in their absence. The scheme was sanctioned yesterday by tbe Watch Committee. Five pensioners were found to volunteer for service, and in future three of such men will be on duty. It is believed that this is the first instance iv which a borough Las adopted such a scheme. \" Whips \" as Scouts. Our Army in South Africa has shown itself peculiarly deficient in the matter of scouting, aud those at home who wish to help might do worse, writes a Correspondent, than tuin their attention to the body of efficient scouts that have been trained by fox-hunting. If every Master of Hounds or Hunt Committee would undertake to equip and despatcli one of tiieir whips to South Africa they would provide a body of nvn accustomed to the saddle, quick of si -ht, immediately ready for work, and of the utmost value to our troops ; a company of scouts, indeed, that could not be excelled. Tiiat a hundred such men could be raised iv a very sliort time tiiere can be little doubt. Tiie matter is one that may be commended to the notice of those who, unable to go to South Africa them- selves, are patriotically anxious to do something towards helping their country over the present crisis. In any case, the assistance of the whips would form a most satisfactory justification for our national sport. Transport Arrivals at the Cape. The dates of arrival at the Cape of troop transports andfreight ships no won the way, or expected to I.c so by next Thursday night, are anticipated as follows : Gascon, January 6; Avoca and Tintagel Castle, January 8; Princess of Wales, Sumatra, and Cestrian, January 9 ; Dunottar Castle (with Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener) and lonic, January 12 ; Gaika, January 13 ; Ottoman, January 15: Jeluuga, January 17; Orient. January 18 ; Nomadic, Kildonan Castle, and Cymric, January 20 ; Assye, January 23 ; and Braemar Castle and Goorkha, January 2G. Movements of Transports. A telegram from Lloyd's Agent at St. Vincent, dated January 1, states that the transport Ocampo, homeward bound from the Cape of Good Hope, bad arrived there. The transport Manchester Corporation is still detained at Gibraltar for repairs. Some of the horses on board have developed influenTa. Necessity for Special Effort. \"A Disgusted Englishman \"asks: \" Is it not time that the voice of the country made itself felt as to tbe necessity f or some special effort being made to cope with the situa- tion now existing in South Africa? It is now nearly a fortnight since the appeal for Volunteers lor the front was made, an I it should surely have been possible for a country possessing the resources of Great Britain to have equipped aud put on board ship by this time 2,000 Infantry Volun- teers fully provided iv every respect. In the case of Yeomanry, it would necessarily take lon-er, but there appears to be an utter absence of recognition that the necessity for expedition is urgent. The sole effort, so far as Volunteers are concerned, appears to be to institute a competitive examination to prevent their services being accepted, and the country is beginning to wonder whether itsiulersare competent for the task which lies before them. As a suggestion, let the London Chamber of Commerce, or the Lord Mayor, call together a meeting of representative City business men. Let them appoint a committee con- sisting of a prominent shipowner, a financier, heads of commercial clothing establishments, ar.d those dea'ing with the supply of arms and ammunition. This might be an Emergency Committee under the supervision of officials from the War Office, who would in ail probability do the necessary work with far greater expedition than is now apparent, and would relieve a department apparently over- burdened by duties which should lave been foreseen and provided for. At the present time we are muddling ea : with driblets of troops and contemptibly slow transports. Will not the nation mak.i its voice beard and insi.st on the resources of the country being utilised in thia emergency. i MOBILE FOHCEs. \"Cycle : ' writ- s: \"Some progress will have been made; in providing a mobile force fur South Africa when the ' 10,000 Imperial Yeomanry have reached the front ; but far more are required. Why uot have recourse to cycling Volunteers ?? \" I AKTIMKBV AMI Ml'T.Vs. \"A Retired Oliicer\" writes: \"The Government lost a giand chance when they sent Lord Kitchener to Africa. His organising power cannot there produce aitil'.ery or mules\u2014 the t-.vo things most wanted. He ought to be at the War OUice, not as adviser, but a* Secretary of State for War.\" j Tiik Exhaustion ok the Enemy. Colonel 11. 11. Haniia, in the couise of a long letter, I nays: \"To put my views iuto a single sentence, I believe that our chances of success lie in the exhaustion of our enemies, and that that exhaustion will set in with rapidity proportioned to the distance from their base at which we apply to them the strategy by which Wellington at Torres Vedras checked the advance of Mas-ena's large army, and j then compelled it to retire utterly worsted, demoralised, I and shorn of n-arly half its numbers. Hut the success of even this strategy will depend on the s-pirit in which we continue to conduct the war, and on the amount of hope of I penerous treatment at its close which we leave not only- to the Dutch of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, j but to those of Cape Colony whose loyal cy is being exposed - to so severe and unnatural a trial.\"' i\" Before it is too Late.\" \"C. IL P.\" writes: \"1 read with great satisfaction the I very able despatch of your War Correspondent, Mr. Winston | Churchill. He called attention to one point which, though of the utmost importance as bearing on the present military ' situation in South Africa, seems to have been overlooked : by nearly- all commentators on this war, and possibly to j some extent by the autl-.orities. I refer to the following I statement: 'The individual Doer, mounted ami in a suit- I ahle country, is worth from three to live Regular soldiois.\" I believe this to be the absolute tru'h, and what is true of j the individual is equally tiue of the Doer Army, and hence | the explanation of our constant repulses an.l ineffective successes. Admitting the supposition that the mobile I Doer is equal to, say, four Regular soldiers, and estimating I the Poer forces at 50,000 men, we should then require | 21)0,000 soldiers in South Africa before we should equal the Poer strength. When we realise the exceptional diificul- | ties of this campaign, is it not the duty of every one j to urge the Government to bring our forces up to the requisite strength before it is too late.\" The Tat oe Oeeicebs Taken* Prisoner. Captain F. H. Hastings, Stratford-on-Avon, writes : \"Can it he possible, as stated by your very able War Correspondent, Jlr. Winston Churchill, that 'under the Queen's Regulations no pay is given while the officers are prisoners ? If this is true it seems a most cruel and unjust regulation. Through no fault of their own some thousands of our gallant countrymen are enduring a worse fate than that of a hardened criminal, and yet they are to be deprived of their well-earned pay because they suffer the greatest misfortune that can happen to a soldier iv becoming prisoners of war. It is not a case where we can appeal to public charity to help them, but public opinion, as expressed through every newspaper in the United Kingdom, should demand that the Government should instantly repeat such an iniquitous regulation and that steps should at once be taken to authorise the | American Consul at Pretoria to advance to our prisoners their pay ami allowances the same as if they were still in the fighting line.\" Perk?. \u2014 ln furtherance of Lord Wantage's scheme for I suitably equipping those Volunteers who are acc?pted for terviee in South Africa as members of the Eerkshire j Yeomanry ami Volunteer Regiments, a meeting called by l the Mayor, Mr. A. T. Parber, was held at Windsor Guild- j hall yesterday afternoon. The Mayor, iv announcing the ! first list of subscriptions, amounting yester lay to \u00a3851, said the following were the chief amounts received: Sir F. Tiess Parry, M.T., \u00a3500 ; Paron Schroder. \u00a3250 ; Mr. F. Rieardo, J.P., \u00a350 ; the Vicar of Windsor, \u00a310 ; Mr. A. A. Somerville, \u00a310 ; and himself, \u00a310. I The Mayor stated that Derkshire was going to provide j two complete companies of Yeomanry and Volunteers, and I he was sure the Royal Porough of Windsor would not be j behindhand either in men or money. On the proposition | of Mr. Councillor Caley, seconded hy Lieutenant Good- I ford, and supported by Major Somerville, a committee was appointed to carry out the objects of the meeting. Devonport.\u2014 Tha men of the Royal North Devon i Hussars and others accepted in Devon for the Imperial j Yeomanry, will assemble for drill at Damstiplc on Thurs- day next. Mr. Eyton, Master of the Stevenstone Fox- hounds, will go out with tlie corps. Captain Sanders, Master of the Staghounds, Captain Scott Browne, Master of Foxhounds, and Captain De Las Casas, of the Tiverton Staghounds, have also offered their services. Dorchester. \u2014 An enthusiastic county meeting was held jat Dorchester yesterday, under the presidency of Lord j Pchester, to raise a fund for the equipment of tho Dorset : Contingent of the Imperial Yeomanry. Lord Ilchester and Lord Wimborne each subscribeil \u00a31,000 ; Mr. Pass, of Charmouth, \u00a3500 and a charger ; the High Sheriff \u00a3250, Lord Rigby \u00a3.'OO, Sir Elliott Lees \u00a3500, Lord Shaftesbury \u00a3100.

In connection with the Yorkshire contingent of the Imperial Yeomanry, recruiting at Leeds \u2014 where there is a school for Yeomanry\u2014com- menced in earnest yesterday. A number of horses for South Africa have already been purchased by the horse committee of the Yorkshire contingent. Several well-known civilian volunteers for the Imperial Yeomanry were accepted at Doncaster by the Earl of Scarbrough. There are now in the Leeds Rifle Battalion about 200 recruits for the Imperial service. The detachment to go to the front will be attached to the 2nd Bat'alion Prince of Wales's Own West Yorkshire Regiment, under Colonel Fred Kitchener, brother of Lord Kitchener.

Sir Christopher Furness has written to the Earl of Durham : \" Seeing that at your instance and that of Earl Grey the Counties of Northumberland and Durham are about to contribute in conjunction with the Elsvvick Works not only funds but also what is still more valuable in the existing national crisis (more critical than any experienced by the British people since the dark days of the Indian Mutiny), namely, contingents of their sons for active service in South Africa, may I be per- mitted to suggest that I think it would be in harmony with and also meet with tbe approval of all classes of inhabi- tants of the two counties if the men who volunteer for enrolment in the Mounted Infantry and tho3e in the Elswick battery should be embarked at Newcastle-on-Tyne and proceed direct, and for this purpose I shall be glad as a I Durham man, and as a member of the Lord Mayor of I London's Transport Committee, to co-operate with yourself i and Lord Grey regarding tbe engagement of a suitable I transport steamer .\" The Lothians.\u2014 Ninety-three Volunteers have offered themselves in the Mid and East Lothians for service ! abroad in the Imperial Yeomanry, and of that number 47 belong to the Lothians and Berwickshire Yeomanry.

Winchester. \u2014 An influential county meeting, convened by Sir Richard Rycroft, High Sheriff, was held at Win- chester yesterday, to raise a fund to assist the Yeomanry aud Volunteers going to the front and the families of soldiers ar.d sailors. It was stated that one company of j Light Horse had been formed, and that more volunteers than were required were forthcoming. Over \u00a33,000 was promised of the \u00a34,000 needed. The wages of 40,000 operatives employed in the woollen industry in New England were advanced yester- day. In a few small factories, however, no advance was mad?.

Advance parties joineel the steamer on Sunday, but the main body diel not go on board till yesterday. The troops going by the Cymric include the Brigade Division Staff, Royal Field Artillery, the 76th, 81st, and 82d Batteries of the Royal Field Artillery, the 2d Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment, a draft of the 2d Battalion Scottish Rifles, a detachment from the Ist West Riding Regiment, and the 18th Company of the Royal Army Medical Corps.

The total complement taken by the Cymric was 59 ofticers anel 1490 rank and file, besides 400 horses and 20 field guns. Arriving by half-a-dozen special trains from Aldershot and Glasgow, the troops marched from the Lonelon anel North-Western Dock Station to the Canada Dock, where the Cymric was lying. Being practically a general holielay, large numbers of the public journeyeel to the Docks to witness the embarkation. Some lively scenes were witnessed in the course of the arrivals. The troops were in the best of spirits, and the Scotch contingent were particularly jubilant, no doubt largely owing to their celebrating the New Year in the time-honoured fashion of their countrymen. Tho Cymric was clue to leave by the night tiele, between 11.0 and 12.0 o'clock, but her start may be delayed till this morning. She will accomplish the journey to the Cape in about 18 clays.

Ten thousand persons gave an ambulance party proceeding to South Africa a very enthu- siastic send-off at Leicester last night. The fire, police, and other ambulances marched through the town, headed by a brass band, and the streets were lineel with spectators. The rail- way station gates had to be locked to keep back the crowd. Captain E. Wood, of the Devonshire Regi- ment, son of Sir Evelyn Wood, has been ap- pointed Aide de Camp to General Sir W. Chermside. CITY VOLUNTEER REGIMENT. ENROLMENT AT GUILDHALL. The detachments of the various Metropoli- tan Volunteer Battalions who have volun- teered to serve in South Africa in the newly-raised City of London Imperial Volunteer Regiment assembled at their various headquarters early yesterday morning preparatory to marching to the Guildhall to be enrolled. The authoriseel strength of each contingent is 40 rank and file and one officer, but at present some of the drafts are incomplete, owing, it must be stated, to the policy adopted in raising the regiment. Each of the Volunteer Corps furnishing men was required to send in the 40 names without delay. The result is that the moment a sufficient number had volunteered their names and regimental numbers had to bo forwarded, without regard to the fact that they had not passed the medical inspection, and that there was no time to examine their complete fitness for service. In several cases the men offering themselves were not 21 years of age, and their parents objected to their going out. On the other hand, the Mansion House authori- ties required that only those whose names had been submitted should present themselves yesterday. The result was that several detach- ments were considerably short of the required strength, which will have to be made up. The parade of the Volunteers attracted large crowds to the various headquarters, who waiteel patiently in the fog and damp in order to give the men a cordial send-off. As each detachment re- presented the flower of the battalion \u2014 all the men being physically sound, between 20 and _0 years old. marksmen, and unmarried\u2014 it may be ?? lor granted tiiat tlie City ol London Imperial Volunteers will prove a regiment of high efficiency and capacity. The contingents marched to the Guildhall headedbytheirbandsplayingpatrioticairs. Large crowds assembled in Cheapside and King-street, and loudly cheered the men as they marched up. The first to arrive was a fine eletachment of the Artists, 50 strong, with Colonel Edis and Lieutenant Croft. The band played the regimental quick-step, \"They all love Jack,\" composed by Mr. Maj-brick, who was at the time an officer in the Corps. The men in grey were quickly followed by the 3d London, under Captain anel Adjutant Jenner. This scarlet-coated contingent, marching to \" Soldiers of the Queen,\" was enthusiastically cheered by the spectators. Col.MortimerHancock, accompanieel by two officers, attended in mufti. The Inns of Court (14th Middlesex) came next, numbering 16 cyclists and 21 mounted Infantry. This very workmanlike-looking body was I under Captain Norton. The London Irish (16th Middlesex), uneler Captain Concannon, followeel. At twelve o'clock the 3d V.B. Royal Fusiliers, Queen's Westminster, oth Middlesex, IstV.B. Middlesex Regiment, 17th Middlesex, 2d Middlesex, and 19th Middlesex arrived in succession. On their arrival the Volunteers marched into the large hall, anel were drawn up at attention to receive the Lorel Mayor anel his colleagues on their entry shortly afterwards. The spacious apartment then presentee! a very pictu- resque and striking appearance, with the Lord Mayor, tho Sheriffs, and Alder- men in their scarlet robes, golel chains, anel furs, seated before a green baize-covered table at one end, and the grey and scarlet uniform of officers of tho staff and the rank and file massed at the other. Supporting the Lorel Mayor were Alelermen Bevan anel Treloar, the Sheriffs, the h*te Lord Mayor (Sir John Voce Moore), Aldermen Dr. Crosbie, J. C. Bell, Sir Reginald Hanson, Sir James T. Ritchie, S. Green, and Sir Henry Knight. Among tho officers present wore Colonel Mackinnon, appointed by the War Office to command the regiment, Colonel C. E. Turner, R.A., Colonel C. E. Boxall, Colonel Sir Howard Vincent (commanding the Infantry portion of the regiment), and Lieutenant W. W. Grantham, A.D.C. to the South London Volunteer Brigade, Colonel < \u00ab. Trollope, who will command the Queen's Westminsters eluring the absence of Sir Howard Vincent, and Lieut. Colonel Cholmoneleley. Three cyclists of the llth Middlesex (AVcst London) wero on eluty in the hall as orderlies. After some preliminaries, the Lorel Mayor, stepping upon a chair, addressed tho men, who were called to attention. Ho saiel :-\u2014 Gentlemen, \u2014 On behalf of the Corporation of the City of London, T thank you for assembling to-day in this Guildhall. It is a vexed question whether or not the first day of January ushers in the new century, but it is beyond doubt that you to-day inaugurate a new era in our national history (cheers). You are here with the deliberate and set intention of voluu- tarily taking upon yourselves the hardships and dangers incidental to a serious campaign. The object you have in .view is worthy even of your great sacrifice. The determination which impels your conduct animates the manhood of the nation. We havo been forced to the arbitrament of war, and we shall not sheathe the sword until our supremacy in South Africa is established (cheers) \u2014 a supremacy which will be universally wel- comed as securing in that country equality before the law to all nationalities, and, in consequence, real freedom in its best and only true sense. Gentlemen, your splendid patriotism is deeply appreciated. To you belongs signally tho honour of leading a move- ment which stirs every city, town, and hamlet through- out the Kingdom. As a humble representative and servant of the Corporation, and as (}hief Magistrate of the City of London, I can but offer feeble thanks in return for your devotion to Queen and country (cheers). You will bo under tho command of Colonel Mackinnon, appointed by the War Office (cheers), of Lieut. Colonel Sir Howard Vincent (cheers), and Lieut. Colonel Cholmondeley (cheers), whose names in connection with the Volunteer movement need ouly to be inentioneel to secure enthu- siastic reception. The remaining officers have been selected from the recommendations of your own commanding officers, and the arrangements entered into with the authorities have thus been carried out, and all arrangements are completed for equipment and embarkation on the 13th inst. of the first draft of 500 men and corresponding officers. Your co-operation and assistance in carrying out all details are earnestly in- vited. I believe you will be satisfied with the arrange- ments made for your comfort during the voyage out ; but you must not forget that you are going as soldiers, not as first-class passengers, in which character no doubt most of you arc accustomed to travel. Those of you who leave on the 13th inst. will have an advantage over those who embark \u00abvb a later date, because you will have had longer experience of the climate and coimtry, and such as arc horsemen will havo oppor- tunities of becoming acquainted with their mounts, which will be in readiness for their arrival. The swearing in of the men was then pro- ceeded with. Nearly all had been examinee! by their own medical officers, the War Office hav- ing consented that all such examinations shoulel be taken as satisfactory. Copies of the special attestation form provided by the War Office for the present campaign only had been previously sent to the headquarters of each regiment antl there read over carefully, and all particulars filled in and signed by those volun- teering. Colonel Mackinnon, acting as the approving Field Officer, verified tho correctness of the contents. A dozen Artists wore tho first to be called up, and each was sworn to allegiance to his Queen and country by the Lord Mayor, assisted by the City Solicitor(Mr.H. H.Crawford), and had read over to him a Government memo- randum explaining that whatever his rank in the Volunteers he was received in that corps as a private soldier, and the commanding officer would select the non-commissioned officers for the new regiment, taking the previous rank and qualifications of each member into due con- sideration. The attestation of the remainder followeel without any hitch or elelay, in batches of six, the Aldermen also administering the oath. For this eventful occasion the olel practice of giving the recruit an enlistment shilling was revived. The Lord Mayor handed each Volun- teer a new shilling fresh from tho Mint, anel bearing the date of the year, 1900, accompanied by a few words of compliment and congratula- tion, and hope for a safe return. The men re- ceived tho memento with manifest pleasure, and no doubt will retain it as a treasured gift. The total number sworn in was 411, and the task was not accomplished until after lunch- time. The remainder of the 1400 men will be enrolled eluring the week. On leaving the Guildhall the newly-enlisted soldiers passed through streets lineel with elense crowds, who suddenly ceased singing verses of patriotic and national songs, in which they in- dulgeel from the very commencement of the proceedings until the end, to welcome them with stanzas of \" Soldiers of our Queen,\" fol- lowed by hearty cheering. In fact, the passage of the corps through that portion of the City was marked by an outburst of patriotism of a most unusually fervid and moving ele- scription. The number enrolled yesterday from Metro- politan Battalions as members of the City of London Imperial Volunteers was as under : \u2014 20th Middlesex. 51 ; 14th Middlesex, 37 ; Ist Middlesex, 40; 2nd Middlesex, 33; 16th Mid- dlesex, 2_: sth Middlesex:, 40 ; 13th Middlesex, 12; 17th Middlesex, 21; 19th Middlesex, 39; 3d Royal Fusiliers, 2rJ; 3d City of Lonelon, 23 ; total, 376. To these must bo addeel 35 officers. Volunteers from other Metropolitan Battalions have yet to be sworn in, and there will also bo further drafts from the particular battalions represented in yesterday's list. The next batch will ho sworn in at the Guildhall, at eleven o'clock to-morrow. Among the sums received yesterelay at the Mansion House for the equipment and trans- port of the City of London Imperial Volunteers to the seat of war were : \u2014 From Messrs. W. and A. Giibey (Limited), \u00a3'210; Sir Charles Hall (Recorder of London), \u00a352 10s.: the Capital and Counties Bank, \u00a3300 ; Mr. D. C. Stiebel, \u00a350 ; Mr. James Donald (to be applied for buy- ing field glasses for the most expert marksmen), \u00a3200; Sir Edward Clarke, M.P., \u00a3105; Lieut. Colonel A. J. Copeland, \u00a35 55. ; Mr. Charles Neck, \u00a331 10s. ; Major R. H. Daniell, \u00a35; Messrs. Henry S. King and Co., \u00a3105 ; and Mr. C. J. Hammonel, \u00a35. Messrs. John Ainsworth and Co., cigar merchants, 39, St. Mary-axe, has offered to the regiment a gift of 25,000 cigarettes at once, to be supplementeel by another 25,000 or 30,000 about a month hence. On Saturelay the Lord Mayor will receive in the Guildhall the Colours of the City of London Regiment (the Royal Fusiliers), to be retained in the custody of the Corporation while that Corps is on active service in South Africa. The ceremony will begin at one o'clock. A State ceremonial will be gone through on the occasion. THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY AND VOLUNTEERS- INSPECTION BY THE PRINCE OF WALES. The Secretary of the Imperial Yeomanry Committee received a letter at the officea in Suffolk-street yesterday from Sir Dighton Probyn. stating that the Prince of Wales was taking the keene?;. uterest in tne work of the Imperial Yeomanry Committee in enrolling their forces for service in South Africa. His Royal Highness asked for information as tothe probable date of the departure of the first detachment, as he was very anxious to per- sonally inspect some of the force. The Secre- tary replied, giving the fullest information possible. The officials were busy all through yesterday at the offices in Suffolk-street, Pail-mall, and it was reported last night that the work of en- rolling troopers was proceeding most satis- factorily. The work of the Remounts Depart- ment has made good progress. Among the subscriptions received yesterelav were the fol- ?? Robert G. Harvey, \u00a3100; Lord Boston, 50 guineas ; Mr. R. Hay Murray, \u00a310; Mr. J. W. Markham, \u00a35 ; Mr. W. W. Howard Yyse, i:2o; Mr. Cremieu Javal, \u00a325; Major Otwav Mayne, \u00a32 25. ; Lady Woolner, \u00a3100 ; Mr. and Mrs. 11. S. Cotton, \u00a322 ; Mr. Landseer Mackenzie, \u00a3_; Mr. R. Hough, \u00a35; and \u00a31400 subscribed jointly by Lord Rothschild, Mr. Alfred de Rothschild, Mr. Leopold de Roth- schild, and the Hon. Walter Rothschild. A representative of a News Agency was in- formed last night, at the offices, that a large number of foreigners hael presented themselves for enlistment, but they were informed that only British subjects coulel be accepted. In some few cases, where the foreigners stated tliat they wero naturalised British subjects, their applications were accepted: but it has since transpireel that in two instances, at least, the applicants have been sent over by some foreign agent. There is some reason to believe, although the officials cannot state so definitely, that the two applicants in question were Boer spies acting underthe instructions of Dr. Ley ds. One said that he had been in a Colonial troop of horse, and his name was taken as a likely candidate. Subsequently, he was denounceel by someone who knew him as a elisloyal Dutch- man from Capo Colony. Tho other was founel out in an effort to secure tlie attestation papers of an officer. In most cases the names of the applicants were struck off the list, and tho matter has been placed in tho hands of Scot- land-yarel authorities. Viscount Curzon has receiveel the sum of \u00a31000 from tho Mansion House Transvaal War Fund towarels the cost of equipping a hospital for the Imperial Yeomanry. Colonel Lord Chesham was in Buckingham yester- day, at the head-quarters of the Royal Bucks Hussars, where the men who have given their names for the Imperial Yeomanry are being medically examined by the regimental doctor. Very few are being refused. The Bucks contingent will comprise two companies, under Captain Dcwinton and Major W. Lawson, late Scots Guards. The men will be practised in Morris tube shooting in the Town Hall, by permission of the Major of Buckingham. At Windsor, Mr. Alfred Barber, the Mayor, presided j yesterday afternoon at a preliminary meeting, held in the Council Chamber, in support of the movement which has been initiated by Lord Wantage, Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire, for equipping such members of the county Yeomanry and Volunteers . as may \"be accepted for service in South Africa. A Resolution in accordance with this object was adopted, and the following gentlemen j will act as the Committee -.\u2014Sir F. T. Barry, M.P., j Baron Schroder, Mr. F. Ricardo, Major General Michael, Mr. A. A. Somerville, Major Ellison, Mr. E. B. Foster, and the Mayor of Windsor, with power to add to their number. Tho Mayor read a list of subscribers. These included Sir F. T. Barry, M.P., who gives \u00a3500 (already promised to Lord Wantage, but which it is understood will be considered as a portion of the Windsor Fund) ; Baron Schroder, \u00a3250 ; Mr. Ricardo, \u00a350 ; tho Vicar of Windsor, \u00a310 ; the total amounting to upwards of \u00a3850. It was arranged that the subscriptions to the Fund should be received at the London and County Bank, Windsor. The Fund opened at the Middlesex Lieutenancy offices, 2, Prince s-street, Storey 's-gatc, Westminster, on behalf of the Middlesex Contingent of the Imperial Yeomanry, amounts to \u00a3640. Amongst the latest sub- scribers is Miss Stainton, who has given \u00a350. Information was received at Slough yesterday that the authorities have accepted, subject to medical examination, 22 out of 27 of the Slough Company of the Ist Bucks Volunteers who havo volunteered for the front. Seventy arc ready for home service. An influential county meeting, convened by Sir Richard Rycroft, High Sheriff, was held at Winchester yesterday afternoon, to raise a fund to assist the Yeomanry and Volunteers going to the front and the families of soldiers and sailors. It was stated that one company of Light Horse had been formed, and that more Volunteers than were required were forthcoming. Over \u00a33000 was promised of the \u00a34000 needed. An enthusiastic county meeting was held at Dor- chester yesterday, under tho presidency of Lord Ilchester, to raise a fund for the equipment of the Dorset contingent of the Imperial Yeomanry. Lord Ilchester and Lord Wimborne each subscribed \u00a31000 ; Mr. Pass, of Charmouth, \u00a3500 and a charger ; the High Sheriff, \u00a3250; Lord Rigby, \u00a3300; Sir Elliott Lees, \u00a3500 ; Lord Shaftesbury, \u00a3100. Nearly \u00a35000 was promised, and Mr. George will give a binocular to each man. It is stated at Northampton that the health of Major the Hon. E. S. Douglas Pennant, M.P., will not permit of his taking the command of the Squadron of Royal Bucks Yeomanry to go to the front, as he at first expressed his -willingness to do. Efforts are being made to raise in Northamptonshire a second A'uluntecr battalion of the 48th Regiment. Lord Spencer's Northamptonshire Fund for the families of Northamptonshire men at the front amounts to over five thousand pounds. A Northwich correspondent says that Captain O. M. Leigh, of Belmont Hall, and Captain Jones, of Liver- pool, have been accepted for service with the Imperial Yeomanry. Sir Philip Egerton, of Oulton Park, has volunteered, as havo also Mr. Cyril and Mr. John Dewhurst, of the Grange, Hartford ; Mr. Benjamin Jones, of Liverpool ; Mr. Bibbey Escourt, of South- port; and Mi. Pilkington, of Liverpool. All these gentlemen are well-known members and followers of the North Cheshire Hunt. More than 100 men of the Hampshire Yeomanry have expressed their desire to serve in South Africa, as well as Major Lewis, Captains Serby and Holt, and Lieutenants Nicholson, Heseltine, and Greenwell. Those who are accepted will probably be quartered in Southampton for ten days before sailing. The Dock and other large companies at Southampton have already placed a considerable amount of stabling at the disposal of the authorities. The men of the Royal North Devon Hussars and others who have been accepted in Devon for the Im- perial Yeomanry will assemble for drill, at Barnstaple, on Thursday next. Mr. Eyton, Master of the Steven- stone Foxhounds, will go out with the Corps. Captain Sanders, Master of the Staghounds ; Captain Scott Browne, Master of the Foxhounds ; and Captain De Las Casas, of the Tiverton Staghounds, have also offered their services. The Northumberland and Durham funds for the equipment of a local contingent of the Imperial Yeomanry will be amalgamated. They now reach together \u00a341,000. Sir Christopher Furness has written to tho Earl of Durham : \u2014 \" Seeing that at your instance and that of Earl Grey the counties of Northumberland and Durham are about to contribute, in conjunction with the Elswick works, not only funds, but also what is still more valuable in the existing National crisis (more critical than any experi- enced by the British people since the dark days of the Indian Mutiny), namely, contingents of their sons for active service in South Africa, may I bo permitted to suggest that I think it would be in harmony with and also meet with the approval of all | classes of inhabitants of the two counties if the men who volunteer for enrolment in the Mounted Infantry and those in the Elswick battery should be embarked at Ncwcastl ?? and proceed direct, and for this purpose I shall be glad, as a Durham man, and as a member of the Lord Mayor of Lonelons Transport Committee, to co-operate with yourself and Lord Grey regarding the engagement of a suitable transport steamer.\" The Government has accepted a Battery of Artillery equipped with modern 15-pounder guns, and manned by skilled artisans, chiefly from Elswick Works. Earl Grey appeals to the public for subscriptions to a fund to meet the expenses of sending out the Battery. The following subscriptions have been promised : \u2014 Mr. C. W. Mitchell, Jesmond Towers, \u00a31000 ; Mr. F. H. Burn, Carlton House, Newcastle, \u00a3100 ; Mr. Robert Coltman Clephan, Southdene Tower, Gateshead, \u00a320 ; Mr. Dietrich Meno Leopold Wiencke, \u00a320. The Duke of Northumberland, who is Honorary Colonel of the Ist Northumberland Volunteer Artillery, has addressed a letter to the Colonel of the Corps, in which he 6ays : \" If your men are going I should be greatly obliged if you could suggest to me any way in which I can, as Honorary Colonel of the Corps, show my appreciation of their patriotic action in a practical manner.\"' About 150 troopers and civilians have given in their names in connection with the Yorkshire Hussars for active service. In regard to civilians, Colonel the Earl of Scarbrough, who is a Lord Lieutenant of the county, and in command of the 13th Yeomanry Brigade, invites offers of service from those between 20 and 55 years of age, and al_o from Volunteers, for the Yorkshire contingent to the Imperial Yeomanry. The Yeomanry Equipment and Emergency Fund for Yorkshire has received some important additions, and on Saturday Mr. T. Wilkinson, as Mayor of Barnsley, announced a list of subscriptions in the borougn to the amount of \u00a31500, the Mayor himself giving \u00a3100. Gifts are coming in from all directions, and none has, perhaps, been regarded with more welcome than the offer by Colonel Allen, commanding the 4th West Yorkshire Volunteer Artillery, to equip a battery. At a meeting held at Welshpool last evening, to enrol Volunteers for the Imperial Yeomanry, upwards of \u00a3800 was raised in the room, Sir Watkin Wynn, Colonel of the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry, sub- scribing \u00a3200, and Lord and Lady Powis \u00a3100. Re- cruiting is proceeding briskly, and upwards of 100 have already been enrolled. All the officers have volun- teered, and Captain Lu_ i noore and Mr. Lane have i fci.iii. _ for active service. The squadron will mobilise on Thursday at Welshpool. Colonel Forbes has pre- sented a Colt gun and galloping carriage to tne squadron. THE TRANSVAAL WAR FUND. THE RED CROSS SOCIETY'S WORK.

He says:\u2014 \"(l) Our Commissioner atthe seat of war is carrying on the work in touch with the Local Branch Committee at Capetown, under the auspices of Sir A. Milner. He is supplying comforts and appliances for the sick and wounded at the front, supplying warm clothing for invalids ou their return journe-y, and many other forms of aid. (2) The Society has chartered and despatched a hospital ship, Princess of Wales, with every comfort, and appliances and a special staff of sur- geons and nurses. Tho fittings have been supplied by the Princess of AValcs from a special fund (remaining from an Egyptian Fund for sick and wounded at her disposal), and the ship being named after her Royal Highness. (3) The Society has constructed and fitted up a model hospital train, which is now being de- spatched for use on the lines of communication, and which is called ' Princess Christian's Train,' her Royal Highness having taken a special interest in it.

(8) The Society is the only channel for conveying money to the military authorities at the seat of war, for the purpose of providing comforts on the spot beyond what are supplied by the Army Medical De- partment.\" In regard to the Transvaal Refugees, the Central Committee at Capetown roport that the total amount granted for relief work to December 13 was \u00a332,190, and the demands arc constantly increasing. Sums of money have been placed at the disposal of the Govern- ment of Natal and the Resident Commissioner of Basutoland for the relief of refugees where no local relief Committees are available. The British Consul at Lourenco Marques was to furnish a further and de- tailed account of expenditure, and other centres which were overwhelmed with refugees were preparing de- tailed statements. In all 11,730 refugees were being relieved, viz., at Capetown, 3072 ; Port Elizabeth, 1558; East London, 1300 ; Durban, 3374 : Pietermaritzburg, 1700; Grahamstown, 494; Port Alfred, 32; Quecns- toWn, 200 ; and Lourenco Marques, 4260. The entertainment for the benefit of the widows and orphans of her Majesty's Household Troops, which is being organised by Mrs. Arthur Paget, will take place at her Majesty's Theatre early in February. It will consist of a Masque, written by Mr. Louis N. Parker, on the lines of Ben Jonson's Masques, which were given at the Palace of Whitehall before James 1., and in which the Queen and the Ladies and Gentle- men of her Court took part. It will be entitled \" The Masque of War and Peace,\" and will be intrepreted by the leading amateurs of the day. This \u25a0will be followed by twelve tableaux vivants of original design, each composed and arranged by a Royal Academician or an Associate of the Royal Academy. These tableaux will be represented by many ladies of society. At the con- clusion of the tableaux there will be a scene, in which England will be surrounded by her Colonies, Depen- dencies, and Possessions, according to their date of acquisition. The massed bands of her Majesty's Household Troops will form part of tho picture, and will play the National Anthem. The entertainment will be under the immediate patronage of the Queen, who has commanded several stalls for the occasion. The Prince and Princess of Wales have promised to be present, as well as all the other members of the Royal family. The theatre for the occasion has been lent by Mr. Tree, who has also undertaken to stage manage and supervise the entire entertainment.

The Cape Times of Dec. 13 gives the text of Sir George White's speech to the Volunteers who took part in General Hunter's sortie from Ladysmith before daybreak on Dee. 8, when the enemy's position on Surprise Hill was stormed and a 96-pounder and a _.7inch howitzer de^ stroyed. After the men had returned to camp the Volunteers, Imperial Light Horse, and de- tachments of Artillery and Engineers who took part in the affair, formed up, and Sir George White adelressed them as follows : \u2014 \" Colonel Royston, officers, and men of the Natal Mounted Volunteers, officers and men of the Imperial Light Horse, and officers and men of the Imperial forces, \u2014 I have heard the details of last nighfs work from Major General Hunter, who so ably planned the ' undertaking and so boldly carried it out, __c has asked \"** \" \"\" me to express to you %\u00a3%\u00a3*% s^^^ ciation, of the admirable manner pleasure 1 \u2022 ported him in it throughout It JJ\u00a3B \u00a3 the &, me that I am here not services. &v\" work you did last ht f^ d >\u00b0^\u2122rtu-uty of acki. e* \" also as I was ?? ?? leelging the value of }\u00b0\u2122 n e ?\u00a3l:f. th& t the very imMor- commenced. lamg_fd *o thinkjna \u00a3 tant sen-ice rendered last ; night was got 0 very few casualties..

RETURN OF TIIE WOUNDED. The Castle Line Company's steamer Garth Castle from Capetown, which arrived at Plymouth yesterday, had on board 36 wounded and sick soldiers from the troops now besiegeel in Ladysmith. Private Crceman, Scots Fusiliers, died on board from double pneumonia at Las Palma., and was buried at sea. The Lord Provost of Edinburgh, at a meeting of contributors to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, held yesterday, said the managers received two days ago a letter froi v the Secretary of State for War asking if they could receive a number of disabled soldiers from the front, and if so how many and on what terms. They had not yet had time to consider the matter fully : but the\" feeling of the managers was to meet that demand as far as they could. He feared that to do their duty properly they would have to appeal to the public for funds to provide proper hospital accom- modation for a considerable number of disabled Scots- men. Things pointed to Edinburgh being au excellent place for temporary work of that kind, aud after the managers had considered the subject fully ho hoped to be in a position to say something publicly on tho subject. The Duke of Portland has sent a thousand phea- sants to the cold storage in Londou for the use of the i \u201eiek and wounded arriving at Netley Hospital from South Africa , and has issued the following: \u2014 \" Welbeck Abbey, January Ist, 1900. '\u2022Sir, \u2014 I havo applied to the authorities at Netley Hospital, and I am told that game is very acceptable to tho patients. With all due deference, may I be allowed to make this suggestion to proprietors of largo estates who may now be finishing up tho seasons sport, that they should send some of their game to tho many cold storage depots now established in most of the great towns. The principal medical officer at Netley, writing from The Copse, Netley, says -. \u2014 'Game will be always acceptable, as from now on large numbers of sick and wounded will continue to arrivo from South Africa, and he considers it would be avery kind and excellent move if the Duke would get his friends to provide some.' \u2014 I am, yours faithfully, \" Portland.\" The body of the late Marquess of Winchester, who was killed in action at Magersfontein, left Capetown by the last mail, and is expected to arrive at South- ampton at the end of next week. It will be buried at Amport, the late Marquess's seat, near Andovcr, with full military honours. The late Marquess was Major of the 2d Battalion Coldstream Guards, and the 3d Battalion, the only one of the Regiments now a. home, will supply the necessary escort and firing party. It is intended that the remains of the deceased officer shall be met at Southampton and conveyed under escort by road to Amport. The Rev. Edgar Sheppard, ?? of the Chapel Royal, will have charge of the arrangements, and the full band of tho Regiment will attend. The following is an extract from a letter written by tbe late Marquess of \"Winchester^ after the battle of Modder River, to the Duke of Portland. Lord Win- chester, who was a Major in the Coldstream Guards, was killed at Magersfontein : \u2014 u Camp, Modder River, South Africa. \u2014 We have been very busy fighting our way up from Orange River to relieve Kimberley, and here we had a toughish job, as the enemy entrenched themselves and held the river, which was well suited for defence. Poor Stopford was killed by a shell. Carcw, in command of the Ninth Brigade, covered himself with glory, and I think gained us the day.'\"' Mr. Labouchere, M.P., has written to a constituent at Northampton who called his attention to a pamphlet, said to have been published at Capetown, in which it was said that he is in receipt of a salary from the Transvaal Government. Mr. Labouchere says: \" Someone sent me the pamphlet. I hardly suppose that the most bitter political opponent believes the statement. If you, or anyone else, can prove before any sort of tribunal of decent men that the statement is true I will make a present to him of \u00a31000.\" Mr. Justice Bucknill informs us that, after a concert at Epsom, last week, for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association, it was suggested to him that a Rifle Club should be formed for Epsom and district, and the Club now exists. At such a time as the pre- sent it is needless to say more about the objects its members have in view than that it is to \"make each of us an efficient defender of his country.\" Mr. G. F. Burgess, Uplands House, Epsom, who first suggested the Club, has consented to act as honorary secretary pro tern., and will gratefully receive any useful hints to help the Committee to draw up the rules. The report to the effect that Commissioner Kilbey, of the Salvation Army in South Africa, is a prisoner at Pretoria is unfounded. Commissioner Kilbey is giving special attention to the housing of refugees in Cape Colony and to the efforts of his officers on behalf of the sick and wounded soldiers at the front.

{"ocr": "TEESSIDE&CLEVELAND CLEVELAND AND DURHAM EISTEDDFOD. The annual Cleveland and Durham Eisteddfod was held yesterday afternoon and evening in the Middlesbrough Town Hall. The event as usual was anticipated with much interest amongst the numerous Welsh communities in the Cleveland and Durham districts, and there was a large entry for the various competitions, the prizes for which were rather larger than last year. At the after- noon meeting Mr. Edward Dawson, J. P., pre- sided, and was accompanied on the platform by Mrs. Dawson, the Mayor (Councillor W. J. Bruce), Mr. Dawson, junr., Mrs. Evans, and Miss Evans (Grangetown), Alderman J. F. Wilson, Mr. and Miss Mackie, Messrs. E. T. John, D. Thomas, E. W. Jones, J. W. Lewis, etc. The artiste engaged for the present Eisteddfod was Miss May John, ?? soprano, and the songs alloted to her were rendered with great taste and feeling. The opening competition was a piano- forte solo for competitors under 12 years of age (\"Le Desir\") for which there were 19 competitors, and the private test during the morning resulted in two being selected to play before the public, viz., Ella and Winifred Storer, of Middlesbrough. The latter whom the adjudicator (Mr. David Jen- kins, Mus. Bac, Aberyswyth) said played with great taste and capital touch was awarded the first prize of 10s. A tenor solo in Welsh for a prize of one guinea was won by Mr. John Davies, of Mid- dlesbrough, and a choral competition which fol- lowed for juvenile voices (not exceeding 50) proved a great treat. The competing choirs were St. John's, conductor Mr. Jas. Smith, and the Grange Juvenile, conductor Mr. Charles Mare, and the test pieces were the \"Keel Row\" and \"New Year's Eve,\" a Welsh air. The adjudicator in awarding the first prize of \u00a35 to the Grjrs.^e Ju- venile Choir said the performance was a delight- ful one, and he trusted those competitions for juvenile voices would be oftener included in the programme. The second prize, taken by St. John's, was \u00a32. Miss May John sang \"Deau Heart, \"and was deservedly encored. A bass or bari- tone solo which followed \"Blow, Blow, thou Win- ter Wind,\" was won by Arthur Crossley. An ad- dress was then given by the president (Mr. E. Dawson), and after wishing all a hearty and pros- perous new year he congratulated the committee on their excellent and successful Eisteddfod. He re- membered the early history of those gatherings in Middlesbrough, and the wonderful advance they had made reflected the greatest credit on the pro- moters. They were, in his opinion, carrying on a grand work. They were promoting the cultiva- tion of music in the town and district. Music had the most elevating tendencies ; it brought joy, health, and comfort in all stages of life, and he had no doubt it was greatly cheering their soldiers who, far away^ would be often singing the songs of their native land. (Cheers.) A charming quartette, \"In Absence. \"by Dudley Buck, for a prize of \u00a32, produced a close contest between the Bohemian and Chord Quartette parties, both of Middlesbrough, and the prize was awarded to the first-named. An essay in Welsh for a prize of 3 guineas was won by Mr. Thomas Williams, of Stockton, and a soprano solo which followed. \" The Swallows,\" by F. H. Cowen, for a prize of 1 e-uinea, was won by Miss Flossie Easton, whom the adjudicator complimented on her fine rendering of the piece. There were 15 competitors. A violin solo for competitors under 12 years of age for 10s. was won by Fred Hale, P. Davies being second. Both instrumentalists were from Stock- ton. The evening proceedings, which were very simi- lar to the afternoon programme, were presided over by Prof. T. Witton Davies. The chief choral competition of the day. for mixed voices, was won by the Teesside Vocal Union, conductor Mr. T. Nicholas : the South Bank and Graugetown r ilee Singers, conductor Mr. Gavin Kay. being second. The prize was \u00a315. A pianoforte solo by females was wop by Louise Sinunonds, Middlesbrough, and a guinea prize for a Welsh solo by juveniles was won by Lillian Pryce. South Bank. A choral competition confined to female voices for a prize of \u00a36 6s. given by Mr. David Evans, was won by die Middlesbrough Ladies' Choir. The Chairman, in the course of an interesting address, spoke of the value of Eisteddfods in en- couraging music, literature, science, and art. He had himself taken part in several, including Eis- teddfods at Witton Park, Stockton, and Middles- brovjh. The tenor solo competition, which hid eighteen entries, was won by Mr. John Davies, Middles- brough, and the quartette competition was won by the Cymric Quartette Party, South Bank. Miss Lotty Thomas, South Bank, was the winner of the contralto solo, and Miss A. Blenkkorn, Middles- brough, won the \\iolin solo contest. io A ch/>ral competition for male voices for \u00a310 10s. brought forward three choirs, viz., Middles- brough, South Bank, and Cleveland Harmonic Ihe test pieces were \"The Roman Soldier\" and lne Uonaohers\" Serenade,\" and the prize was eventually awarded to South Bank. The proceedings closed with the Welsh National Anthem and Chorus, the song being rendered by Miss May John. Mr. Ernest A. Evans was the accompanist, Mr. W. J. Davies conductor, and the arrangements were satisfactorily carried out by thehon. sec, Mr. Bowen. CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOUR CONFERENCE.

{"ocr": "THE PRINCE OF WALES. \"BOER SPIES\" DIRECTED TO PRETORIA. Yesterday morning General Sir Dighton Probyn, Comptroller and Treasurer to the Priuee of Wales, wrote to the committee at the headquarters in Suffolk-street stating that his Royal Highness was taking the keenest interest in the raising of the imperial Yeomanry for service in South Africa, and asking for information as to the probable date of the departure of the first detachment, as the Prince was most anxious to personally inspect some of the force, of which be is Colonel-in-Chief. Lord Valentia, in the abs-lice of Lord Chesham\u2014who was at Buckingham superintending the arrangements for the formation of two companies from the Royal Bucks Hussars\u2014lost no time in replying to the Royal communication. As already stated, the first contingent will leave England about a fortnight hence, but it. composition has got ytt been settled. It is tolerably certain that an opportunity will be afforded to inspect the London section, but there are obvious difficulties in the way of concentrating the entire force in the ntetropuliti for the purpose of as official inspection. Quite a sensation was caused by tho announcement exclusively made in The Daily Telegraph as to the attempt on the part of Dr. beyds to get \u2022 number of Boer emissaries enrolled in the Imperial Yeomanry. We Ole now at liberty to state that two suspected spies were actually enrolled, though not sworn in. They had avowed that they were naturalised British subjects, but on being asked to produce their letters of naturalisation they were unable to comply with this essential preliminary, and were thus bowled out. On first applying for enlistment they asserted that they had spent most of their lives in Australia, but suspicion was aroused by the circumstance that whilst their knowledge of English was very indifferent, they spoke Dutch fluently, and from that moment they were kept under close observation. At least twenty suspicious characters pre' tented themselves in Suffolk-street on Saturday, and half-a-dozen more yesterday ; but, on being informed by the astute official to whom callers are introduced that if they wanted to enlist they had better go to Pretoria, they quitted the office indulging in remarks more emphatic than polite. As at present advised, the authorities are disposed to rest content without resorting to legal proceedings. News of General French's brilliant victory at Colesberg reached headquarters shortly after five o'clock, and produced the liveliest satisfaction, the officials pointing out that it afforded still another justification\u2014if any more were neededfor the raising of the Imperial Yeomanry. While Lord Chesham woe down in Bucks, another important member of the committee, Mr. Walter Long, President of the Board of Agriculture, was en a visit to Chippenham, wataing the interests of the Royal Wiltshire detachment, the right hon. gentleman being colonel of that regiment. Again, everybody at the Suffolk-street offices, from Lord Valentia, on the one hand, to Joggers, the district messenger, on the other, was busily engaged from morning to night. Substantial contributions to the fund were announced during the day. Lord Rothschild, Mr. Alfred de Rothschild, Mr. Leopold de Rothschild, and the Hon. Walter de Rothschild, together gave the liberal sum of \u00a31,400, while the following subscriptions were received through Lord Rothschild : Sir Robert G. Harvey, Bart., \u00a3lOO ; Lord Boston, \u00a352 10s; Mr. It. Hay Murray, J.P., \u00a310; Mr. J. W. Markham, ; Mr. W. W. Howard-Vyse, \u00a325 (specially ear-marked for the Bucks Yeomanry) ; Mr. Cremieu Java!, \u00a325 ; and Major Otway Mayne,\u00a32 2s. The gifts which , reached the committe direct were: Lady Woolner, \u00a3100; Mr. and Mm. 11. S. Cotton, \u00a322; Mr. Landseer Mackenzie, \u00a35; Mr. R. Hough, \u00a35 ; and collected by Miss Foot, 6s. Among the applicants were a number of men with excellent military qualifications. A letter from a would-be recruit possessed a pathetic interest. The writer, who hailed from St. John'swood, respectfully proffered his services, and expressed a hope that, for his own sake, they would be accepted. He said : \"I am sixteen years of age, but out of work. As lam the eldest of five brothers, I shall not be missed.\" Dr. Horace Manders, of Gloucester-terrace, Hyde Park, whose Medical experience dates back to the period of the Paris Commune, when he attended the Beaujon Hospital, under Dr. Dolbsen, waited upon the committee and offered to enrol himself in the Imperial Yeomanry, with the view of taking to South Africa a \" Galloping Hospital \" which he has invented. The hospital is intended to move with cavalry and promptly render first aid to wounded soldiers. In appearance somewhat resembling an Irish car, it has a pole but no shafts, is drawn by two horses, carries complete apparatus for operating and dressing, and is capable of accommodating five wounded men, who could be readily conveyed from the immediate front to the base hospital. The matter is reoeiving the attention of the comittee. Mr. Richard Baggallay, eldest son of Mr. Ernest Baggallay, the Nest Ham stipendiary, has volunteered and been accepted for service, in the Imperial Yeomanry. Mr. Baggallay is about twenty-two years of age, and has joined the Staffordshire Corps, in which his uncle is au officer. It is announced that the following gentlemen form the Committee of Commanding Officers of Soottiah Yeomanry regiments appointed by the General Officer commanding the Scottish District to consider all questions connected with the enlistment of Volunteers for the Imperial Yea' manry : Colonel Sir Wlll. Baillie-Hamilton, K.C.M.G., C. 8., Lothians and Berwickshire Yeainanry (president) ; Colonel R. M. Pollok, Ayrshire Yeomanry ; Colonel Sir Simeon M. Lockhart, Bart., ; Lieutenant-Colonel J. Addle, Lanarkshire Yeomanry; Colonel J. Neilson, Lanarkshire Yeomanry (Queen's Own); and Lieutenant-Colonel Sir J. Gilmour, Bart., V.D., Meshire Volunteer Light Horse. The offices of the committee are at the Castle Terrace, Edinburgh. With the approval of the General Officer corn mending the Scottish District it has been decided Dutton candidates for the Imperial Yeomanry who are not already members of a Scottish Yeomanry regiment must first enlist in the Yeomanry, which they may do for one year. They are at liberty to enlist in any regiment they may prefer, the regiments being as follows: Ayrshire, Lanarkshire, Lothians and Berwickshire, Lanarkshire phis- gow), Fifeshire Light Horse Volunteers (Winch for present purposes is regarded as a Yeomanry regiment). All persons resident in England who aro desirous of being enrolled in the Scottish contingent of the Imperial Yeomanry should apply to Colonel Sir William Batllie-Hamilton, C. 8., the Castle Terrace, Edinburgh, stating the regiment in which they desire tole enlisted. It has been decided to amalgamate the funds separately instituted iu Northumberland and Durham to equip contingents: of Imperial Yeomanry for South Africa. The Northumberland fund amounts to \u00a327,000, and that of the sister county to 1:14,000. Sir Christopher Furness has addressed a letter to the Earl of Durham suggesting that it would be in harmony with, and also meet with the approval of, all classes of the inhabitants of the two counties if the men who volunteer for enrolment in the Mounted Infantry, and also those in the Elswiek Battery, should be embarked at Newcastle-on-Tyne and proceed direct. For this purpose I shall be glad, as a Durham man and as a measlier of the lord Mayer of London's Transport Committee, to co-operate with yourself and Lord Grey regarding the es-, gagement of a suitable transport steamer.\" Colonel Lord Chesham visited the headquarters of the Royal Bucks Hussars at Buckingham, yesterday, when the men who had signed the register for foreign terries were present for medical examination and Anal approval. His lordship, who had a hearty reception, was highly gratified with the appearance of the men. The officers present ware Major A. Leder, Captain De Winton, Lieutenant Percival, Dr. Kia/Imark, and Captain and Adjutant Etandwith. The sergeant-reap n attended to the weighing and =assuring, and the Men were medically =mined by the veteran Dr. railmark. Very few were rejected end these, curiously enough, failed in their riling. The Mayo. , snit po mtion have placed the Town Hall at the use of L. newly-enrolled eernany for Vann tube poet ee, l and Lord Cr ' , sham stated that he was =nab pleased with the wk d a which the matte\u2022 had been ta,\" en' by all parties. Twenty members lb. C Company, let Rucks Rifle Volunteers, nmeeeded from Duck\u2022ng- ham yesterday to Wolverton for monad naminattor for foreign service. Last night it was asewtained that the North IChtehire is to toes or a ties sows of its most brilliant riders. Captain 0. M. Leigh, of Belmont Hall, and Captain Jonas, of Liverpool, have been accepted for service with the Imperial Yount/tory, and among those who have volunteered are Sir Philip Egerton, of Oulton Park; Mr. Cyril and Mr. John Drahurst, The Grange, Hartford; Mr. Benjamin Jones, Liverpool; Mr. Bibbey iscourt, Southport; and Mr. Pilkingtou, Liverpool. All these gentlemen are well-known members and followers of the North Cheshire Hunt. Mr. Alfred Barber, the Mayor of Windsor, resided yesterday at a preliminary meeting held in the Council Chamber, in support of the movement winch has been initiated by Lord Wastage, Lord Lieuter tot of Berkshire, for equipping midi members of tie county Yeomanry and Volunteers as may be accepicd for service in South Africa. A resolution in se iordaims with this object was adopt d,. and the follomug gentlemen will set, as the committee : Sir F. T. Barry, M.P., Baron Schroeder, Mr. F. Ricardo, Major- General Michael, Mr. A. A. Somerville, Major Ellison. Mr. F. B. Foster, and the Mayor of Windsor, with power to add to their number. The Mayor read a list of subscribers. These included Sir P. T. Barry, M.P., who gives \u00a3500; Baron Schroeder, MO; Mr. Ricardo, \u00a35O: the total amounting to upwards of \u00a3B5O. Au enthusiastic county meeting was held at Dorcheater yesterday, under the presidency of Lord Itchester, to raise a fund for the equipment of the Dorset contingent of the Imperial Yeomanry. Lord Ikhester and Lord Wimborne each subscribed Mr. Pass, of Charmouth, \u00a35OO and a charger; the High Sheriff. \u00a3250; Lord Rigby, \u00a3300; Sir Filliott Less, \u00a3500; Lord Shaftesbury, \u00a3lOO. Nearly \u00a35,000 was promised, and Mr. George will give a binocular to each man. The formation of a Warwickshire company of Imperial Yeomanry for the front in exciting the greatest interest in the county. The fund started by Lord Leigh for equipping the force is being loyally supported, and the Marchioness of Hertford hoe now issued an appeal for knitted socks and other eomforta for the men. The Countess of Warwick and other county ladies are organising a concert in aid of the Yeomanry fund. At a sleeting held at Welshpool last evening to enrol volunteers for Imperial Yeomanry, upwards of \u00a3BOO wail raised in the room.

{"ocr": "STOCK EXCHANGE AND CITY NEWS. LARGE ARRIVALS OF GOLD. BANKERS' CLEARINGS. \u2666 Cornhill Chambers, Monday Evening. It is scarcely surprising that with the dis- bursement of something like fifteen millions sterling in dividends, and the receipt of nearly one million anel a quarter in gold at the Rank from abroad, discount rates should have weakened slightly to-day. A few of the Joint- Stock Banks took bills from the market at 5_ per cent., but they were not working freely, and that was the usual rate in the open market. This afternoon the rate >vas quoted in some places a trifle firmer at 5\u00a7 to 5| per cent., the proximity of the Treasury Bill issue to-morrow probably strengthening the market. Rates are too unsettled to attempt to estimate the price at which these Bills are likely to be allotted. In tho market to-day from 4 _ to 5 per cent, was. spoken of as a possible rate for six months' bills ; but it was only a matter of guesswork. All tho loans falling due to the Bank to-day were repaid, ancl about L2ot\\ooo was also taken ofl' the market by the India Council. Call loans wero therefore in good demand early in the day at about 5 per cent.; but money came out later, and loans were subsequently offered for the night at 4_ per cent. For weekly advances the charge ranged from _f to 5 per cent. The Con- tinental markets being closed, there are no movements to note in the foreign exchanges. Market Discount?. Bank and Ho__ _ Rates.

AYe have received the subjoined letter and statistics in reference to the working of the Bankers' Clearing House. In view of the ex- traordinary activity in trade throughout the year the total increase in the clearings is not altogether surprising, but that the payments on Stock Exchange Account days should beat all precious records is a rather unexpected an- nouncement, and would seem to indicate that activity in Public Securities has been greater than generally supposed : \u2014 Sir, \u2014 I beg to forward you the amount of bills, cheques, & c., paid at the Bankers' Clearing House during the* year ended 31st December, 1899, being \u00a39,150,269,000, which is \u00a31,052,978,000 more than passed through in 1898, and is larger than any amount \u00ab>n record. The payments on Stock Exchange Account days form a sum of \u00a31,544,295,000, an increase of \u00a3312,448.000 as compared with 1898, and also larger than any amount on record. The payments on Consols Account days for the same period have amounted to \u00a3403,042.000, being an increase of \u00a3181,000 as com- pared with 1898. The amounts passing through on the 4ths of the months for 1899 have amounted to \u00a3359,088,000, showing an increase of \u00a327,821,000 as compared with 1898.

(Limited), which firm he helped to found in 1860, and was also Chairman of the London Metal Exchange. l hie of the ablest Consular Reports recently published is issued to-day on the financial position of f'reece. Owing to the disturbed condition of the country in consequence of the war with Turkey, it must have been no easy matter to show the progi-ess of financial affairs since ls9t>. Mr. Corbett's Report, however, re- views very fully the figures for the whole of tho period from 1894 to 1898. as well as the Budget Estimates for 1899. It is impossible to repro- duce here the full details of this very valuable summary, which should be perused in the Report itself, but some of the concluding re- marks summing up the general position may well be touched upon. These are mainly to the effect that there are abundant indications of sufficient natural resources in Greece to make good tho financial losses inflicted, directly or indirectly, by the war. \" How great,\" says Mr. Corbctt. \"the vitality of the country is has been fully demonstrated by the elasticity with which the nation has rebounded from the effects of the war. The ordinary receipts for 1898, during a largo part of which year Thessaly was still in ihc hands of the Turks, show a total higher than that of any preceding year, and from personal observation I can bear witness to the evident revival on every side of commercial enterprise.\" This result is ascribed by Mr. Corbctt. in part at least, to tlie establishment by the Powers of the International Commission \u00ab,;' Control, for that Commission, while it assures the payment without further diminution of the interest on tho Public Debt, also serves in some measure to restrain the Government from in- curring fresh liabilities, and consequently from launching into a policy of adventure. Before 1897, too, the Report reminds us, Greece was in a chronic state of effervescence, and every Spring rumours of war from Crete and Macedonia occasioned public excitement. Crete has now been provided with an autono- mous Government, and the issue of the Turko- Grecian war has sufficiently demonstrated that thc> moment is not propitious for a Greek agitation in the Continental provinces of the Sublime Porte. The restraint thus imposed upon the martial spirit of the country is con- sidered an essential factor in the present revival of commercial confidence. The Report, after referring to some much needed require- ments in the matter of administration, con- cludes as follows : \u2014 ** But, even if these reforms are not forthwith applied in their entirety, there is no reason for anxiety with regard to ihc future. The fact that Greece continued to increase in wealth during the troubled period after 1893, and that the year imme- diately following the war found her richer and more prosperous than ever : above all, the enterprising spi.it of her people, when their attention is not dis- tricted by too ambitious dreams ; and last but not Irv.st. the'efforts that are being made by the present Minister of Finance, if not to introduce sweeping reforms, at least to place taxation on a sounder basis- all the?** combine to make her rapid advance in prosperity, unless interrupted by political aberrations, a matter of certainty.\" According to the New York Commercial Chronicle, received by this mail, the net earnings of the Railroads in the United States continue to progress. The statistics compiled for October, of 1 31 railroaels shows an increase in net earn- in_s of 4.618,000 dollars, while for the four months ending in October, the gain in gross earnings; has ?? about fifty million dollars, and in net not far from twenty million dollars. Tho improvement, moreover, is progressive, following upon material gains both in 1898 and the preceding year. Messrs. Sharps and Wilkins' annual circular gives the following review of the Bullion Market for the last twelve months : \u2014 \" The market for silver was remarkably steady during the first three months of this year, the extreme varia- tion being only _d. per oz., viz., from 27Jd. to 27|d. per oz. std., and during this period a fair business was transacted for the Continent, India, and the Straits, as well as for home aud Colonial coinages. Towards the end of April a wave of speculation set in, and for some weeks large operations for a rise took place, and the price was at one time quoted 28\u00a3 d., with business even a trifle higher than the official rate. This speculation appeared to be based on no reason- able foundation, and much disappointment was felt when it was found that the Eastern exchanges re- sponded but feebly, and that the China Banks, taking advantage of the rise, resold at a good profit some por- tion of their silver due on near and forward contracts. During June, July, and early August; markets re- sumed their normal aspect, at prices a little above where speculation began, the rate during this period being about 27_d. to 273 d., but later on a fall took place to 2S_d. in October with, for a short time, a weak appearance, but a great stimulus was suddenly given to the market in November, by an unexpected demand for silver for Shanghai and later on for the Continent, and with extensive purchases the price rose to ?? and, with one slight exception, the market has remained until recently above 27d. During the fortnight just passed dear money has had a depressing effect upon silver, only small amounts changing hands at a steady decline in value. The movements in gold have been on a much smaller scale than that of the previous year, the imports being some 11,500,000 short, of which 2,500,000 de- ficiency is from Australia, 3,000,000 from France. 1,500,000 from Germany, and nearly 2,000,000 from South Africa ; the latter is due to cessation of shipments in November and December. The ex- ports have been correspondingly less, Germany having taken from us nearly eight millions less than last year, Japan three millions less, and the United States nine millions less. On the other hand, four millions have this year been sent in sovereigns to South Africa, none having been sent in 1893, and one million and a-half more to South America than last year.\" The Directors of the Rio de Janeiro City Improve- ments Company have received a telegram from their Manager at Rio, from which they understand that the Decree altering the contract has been signed by the President. M.yjvli Tea Cojitant. \u2014 Au interim divideud of 3 per cent, is declared on the Preference Shares. Messrs. Angicr Brothers, in their steam shipping Report for 1899, state that the general result of trade to shipping during the past year has proved less pro- fitable than was expected, but far from unsatisfactory. Bad crops in India and Russia created a dearth of freight requirements, only just compensated by the abundant supplies in Argentina and the United States, and destroying the anticipated boom in the carrying trade which was clearly foreseen, and would no doubt have occurred with good shipments from the East and Russian ports. Taking into account the extraordinary increase in tonnage during the year, the net result to shipowners must be considered good, and proves a vast expansion in trade all over the world. The forecast is not very clearly defined, but sufficient data are to hand to make it safest to look for some slight contraction in business generally, at any rate until peace in South Africa restores the vast and expanding commerce which that Continent provides. Messrs. Glyn, Mills, Currie, and Co. have received advice by cable from the London and River Plate Bank at Monte Video, announcing the despatch by mail of a remittance amounting to \u00a35400 for the service of the Uruguay Five per Cent. Loan of 1896. Mr. irlenry Holloway, of the firm of Holloway Brothers, builders, has joined the Board of the Limine r Asphalte Paving Company. Mr. M. P.

Annual Shipping Review. \u2014 Messrs. John White's circular states that another satisfactory year to ship- ping has to be recorded. Shipbuilders and engineers have been fully supplied with orders, and could have completed them much earlier but for the difficulty of obtaining material and the dilatory working of the shipyard men. The result has not been unsatisfactory to some shipowners, having prevented an over-supply of tonnage, which many feared the amount of orders given would produce ; but it has caused great incon- venience to owners requiring vessels for their regular lines. The production of the past year in British shipyards has been about 1.640,000 tons \u2014 very nearly the same total as in 1898. Of the tonnage built about 150,000 tons represent warships, a very much larger quantity than was formerly built in private shipyards ; about 47,000 tons sailing vessels, of various types ; and about 110,000 tons steam trawlers, tugs, steam yachts, and such craft. Thus, close on 300,000 tons are vessels that do not affect the prospects of the ordinary merchant steamer. Of the remainder of the production, about 650,000 tons represent less than 100 steamers \u2014 these are mostly steamers employed in regular lines, having a considerable portion of their tonnage occupied by large propelling power and passenger accommodation. Of these, it is interesting to note, seven steamers total 92.261 tons, varying from 10,376 tons to the Oceanic of 17,274 tons, the largest vessel afloat. During the same period there have been removed from the \" British Register \" about 784,000 tons of steamers and 240,000 tons of sailing vessels. These figures include wrecks, vessels broken up, and sold to foreigners ; and as foreign shipowning is extending, a larger proportion of the tonnage re- moved from the \"British Register \"represents steamers sold to foreigners than in the records of former years. There were added to the \"British Register \" during the year about 1,260,000 tons of steamers and 72,000 tons of sailing ships. At the end of September last, according to the records of Lloyd's \"Register of Shipping,\" there were under construction (excluding warships) iv British shipyards 1,347,549 tons \u2014 steamers and sailing craft \u2014 which is about the same total as at the corresponding date of the previous year. Manu- facturers, owing to the pressure of orders for ship- building and other material, have been much behind in their deliveries, which has delayed the completion of vessels under construction, and with the increased cost of labour, by the unsatisfactory way the men have been working, it is to be feared many builders have suffered serious losses. The revenue statement of the Grand Trunk Railway Company for November shows that the gross receipts amounted to \u00a3412,800, being an increase of \u00a339,437 compared with 1898 ; and the working expenses to \u00a3265.600, or an increase of \u00a323,827. The net profit for the month amounted to \u00a3147,200, showing an in- crease of \u00a315,610, and for the five months to \u00a3739,332, or an increase of \u00a392,197. The revenue statement of the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway Company for the month of November shows that the gross receipts were \u00a367,100, or an in- crease of \u00a36998 compared with 1898 ; and the working expenses \u00a359,100, or an increase of \u00a34942. The net profit for the month was \u00a38000, or an increase of \u00a32056, and for the five months \u00a341,383, or a decrease of \u00a36785. The revenue statement of the Detroit, Grand Haven, and Milwaukee Railway Company for the month of November shows that the gross receipts were \u00a318,700, or an increase of \u00a32151 as compared with 1898 ; and the working expenses \u00a313,600, or an increase of \u00a3193. The net profit for the month was \u00a35100, or an increase of _1958, and for the five mouths \u00a335,093, or an increase of \u00a39192. The Brighton Railway traffic return for the past week shows a decrease of \u00a33987 as compared with the corresponding period last year.

Fromtheusualstatsticsrurished us by 31r. J. Herbert Trittou, lion. Sec. of the London Clearing hankers, it appears that the amount of bills, cheques, etc., paid at the Bakers' Clearing House during the year ended 31st December, 1899, i.e., X9,150,26t9,000, which is ,.6,978,000 moro than passed through in 198, and is largdr than any amount on record. Tbe payments on Stock Exchange account days form a sum of \u00a31,&44,295,000, an increase of \u00a3412,448,000 as compared with 18l8, and also larger than any amount on record. The pay- rnents on Cousols account days for the siame period have amounted to \u00a3403,042,600, being an increase of \u00a3181,000 as compiard with 1898. Ti amounts passing through on the 4ths of the ;nonths for 18l9 have amounted to \u00a3459,088,000, showing an increase of \u00a3227,M1,000 as oom- pored with 1898. GREEK F1INA'NCE. A report on the finances of Greece for the past year by Mr. Vinta Corbett, British delegate en the International FinanciaL Commission at Athens, has been published by the Foreign Office. It continues the anual series which in consequence of the Grwco-`Ttrish War has been interru!)ted since 1896. After dealing with the Budget figures, Mr. Corbett urges the nocessity of reforms, the ?? of which is universally acknowledged by the Greeks them- solves, however much they may despair of the possibility of their being at present carried out in their entirety. They are. 1. Reform of jus- t.ce. Increase of salaries of all judicial officors and freedom of the judges from all possibility or political pressure. 2. Reduction of adminis- trative poste. Incresse of salaries and security of tenure for civil servuanto during geod be- baviour. 3. Suppression of mUggling. He add4: The three reforms mentioned sbove would, I am convinced, Alon, suffice to send up the revenue by 20 per ent. in the first year. The two first, if penusted in for a generation, wouid inahe Greece, what heor illustrions traditicnr entitle her to be, the for t nation in the near East But, even if these reforms are not forthwith applied in their entirety. there is no rnason for anxiety with regard to the future. The fact that Greece continued to increase ill wealth during t:e troubled period after 1.893 and that the year immediately following the war found her richer and mor proaprous than ever; above all, the enterprising Spirit of her people. when their attent:on is not distracted by too ambitious dreems; and last. but not least. the efforts that are being made by the present Mnister of Finance, if not to ntrodu sweeping reforms, t least to plce taxation on a sounder basi-#al these combine to make her rapid advance in pro- sperity, unless interrupted by poltical aberrationu a matter of certainty.

Bowen kicked oif, and Sunderland were the first to become dangerous. A nice centre by Hogwas cleared, and the Wolves, rushing away to the other end, comoelled a corner, which came nothing. This was cleared, and Suuderland of corners, each of which was placed badly. Hogg was next checked for offside about to shoot. The visitors trout rank put PIT GOOD WORK, finishing ud with a shot that skimmed the bar. Sunderland next had turn, aud, following a corner, shot over. Tbe weather now cleared up. Alter niiuutes' play Harper worked tiie bail through cleverly, aud whilst was appealing for offside the Wolves* player the first goal the match. FoiTOwmg this the visitors appeared to take charge the game, the home men not being able to anything right. was not surprising therefore that rush by the VVolvea' right wing should end in the visitors putting on second goal, Tonks appearing to be the scorer. Gradually Suuderluud asserted themselves, aud, after BadueJey had cleared, Leslie rushed up aud scored amid great cheering. The home team next pressed brilliaut style, Hogg, McAllister, andMcLatcbie each puttiug in beauties that gave the defence shaking. Play fluctuated to the interval, which arrived with the score\u2014 Wolvks goals SUNDERLAND goal Sunderland were late turning out for the second half. The Wolves were the aggressors at the outsat, the home team making several ineffectual attempts to force matters. The visitiug halves were very smart, aud repeatedly checked the advances of the home man. The kickiug of the latter, too, was very faulty. Gradually the home men worked their way to the Wolves' end, but the stay was brief one, aud for while the exchanges were of an even character. Suuderkvid then got down, and Hogg came near equalising with capital shot. Suuderiaud had slightly the best the succeeding play, but the Wolves again attacked, and HARPER WAS charging Doig.

FETTESIAN LORRETONLANS j The last named public schools' combination placed a powerful side in the field against Rich- mond, including a large contingent of University plcyers. In the first half the tourists had much the better of matters, G. Ward and Scott gaining tries, the first of which W. Thomson converted in grand style. Richmond were seldom dangerous, and at the interval the Fettesians were leading by a goal and a try to nil. Richmond seldom crossed the half way line the second half, and without playing with particular brilliancy the visitors easily held their own. Ad- ditional tries were scored by Smith and Guthrie, Campbell converting the try by the last named. Richmond improved towards the close, but the result was : Fettes Loretto, 2 goals 2 tries (16 points) ; Richmond, nil. ROSSLYN PARK v CROYDON.

CASTLEFORD v CLECKHEATON ASSOCIATION. THE LEAGUE (Ist DIVISION). NEWCASTLE UNITED r WEST BROMWICH ALBION At Newcastle, before 12,000. Evenness pre- vailed at the outset. The home players got into their stride, and made things warm for Reader and Co. Simmons chilled United with a am rpris e goal half-way throagh, after which the Novacastrians played up and scored three goals quickly, the scorers being Stevenson, Peddie, and Fraser. Half- ?? United, 3; Albion, 1. Play was more even in the second half livery rushes to each end being the features. The United shot wildly. Simmons during a scrimmage scored shot wide. Simmons during a scrimmage scored number two for Bromwich. At the very close of lively, but unscientific play Stevenson added a fourt hfor the United. Final :\u2014 Newcastle, 4; West Bromwich Albion, 2. i BURY v WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS, j Played at Wolverhampton, in fine weather, be- fore 5,000 spectators. Bury were short of two Cup team men, but the Wanderers were stronerly represented. For twenty minutes the Wanderers pressed heavily, and Bury's defence was severely taxed. Baddaley saved from Brimblecombe, but the Wanderers got three corners, and Pheasant scored with a long shot. Both goals were attacked, but the defence was too secure. Half- time : \u2014 Wanderers, 1; Bury, 0. On resuming the Wanderers attacked with vigour, but their combination was at fault and their shooting erratic. The Bury men, too. were off colour, and were seldom dangerous. Their goalkeeper was tested, but saved his charge in a brilliant manner. Result : \u2014 Wolverhampton, 1 ; Bury, 0. MANCHESTER CITY r BLACKBURN ROVERS. At Manchester, before 10,000. The City were short of Read, Williams, and Ross The Rovers started against the wind and sun.

In tha second half E verton attacked, and from a shot Taylor claimed that the ball had been through, bat the referee, after consulting the lines- men, decided against them. Afterwards the Uni- ted pressed hard, and Muir kept goal very gjxigf, being severely tested by nearly every oas of tha home forwards. Towards the close United scored again from a corner kick, and a fourth from a pen- alty kick, Barnes adding a fifth just oa time. I Result : \u2014 Sheffield United, 5; Ererion, nil. ASTON VILLA t SUNDERLAND. In view of the attractiveness of this fixture it was not surprising to find a big crowd assembled at the Villa ground. The Villa had the advantage of the wind. Sunderland were the first to attack, but Villa then compelled them to play on the de- fensive, and the visitors' goal had several narrow escapes. Garrity scored twice for the ViDa. Half- time:\u2014Villa, 2; Sunderland, 0. Tbe second half was fast and well contested. < , Within five minutes of the restart, Farquhar scored, ' and soon after Garratty added one for the Yilta. \u25a0 The game then, for noma time, was in favour of the < Villa, and Johnson scored from a corner. After- wards Sunderland showed improvement, and Leslie , scored by a long shot. After the Villa goal waa often in danger. Result : \u2014 Villa, 4 ; Sun derland, 2. PRESTON NORTH END v NOTTS FOREST.

Gara scored again for Preston. In- terval:\u2014Preston. 2; Forest, nil. In the second half the Forest commenced better, and then North End had three corners iv quick succession, all fruitless. Forest then pressed a short time, bnt never had a really open chance ; still, they kept at it, hammer and tongs. Pres- ton were often dangerous when they got near All- sop, two shots very nearly going home. Result -. Preston, 3; Forest, nil. NOTTS COUNTY v. DERBY COUNTY. At Nottingham, before 8,000 people. Cooke and Lioper were away from Derby. The ground was in fair condition, notwithstanding heavy rains. Notts were brilliant in attack, but met a superb goalkeeper in Fryer. Maconnachie for once Elayed vigorously and well. The Notts goal- eeper did not handle for forty minutes, though Arkesden missed three most easy chances, inter- val : \u2014 Notts. O.i Derby, 0. The second half showed an improvement in the Derby attack, and Sufcer was busy. Quickly the ball went into the Notts net from a free kick, bnt without touching a second player. Bloomer almost beat Suter with a header. Fryer was clever on three occasions, but Derby looked most like winning, but did not. Result : \u2014Notts, 0 : Derby, 0. BURNLEY v GLOSSOP. At Burnley, before about 3,000. Hartley was absent owing to injuries, and Han_ igan made his first appearance. Play favoured Burnley, though they operated against the slope and wind, and in a quarter of an hour Gh adwick scored a splendid goal, and registered a second a minute later. Glossop were seldom dangerous for a long period, and then exerted pressure. Burnley, however, had the upper hand, wresting corners in vain, Williams saving. Interval: \u2014 Burnley, 2; Glos- sop, nil. On the resumption Glossop were the Grst to press, and Hillman was called upon. Play was about even. In tan minutes Goddard scored from a corner conceded by Hilhnan. Burnley re- plied with a desperate pressure, Williams saving magnificently at the expense of a corner. Chad- wick registered Burnley s third point. From this juncture Burnley had the best of mattera. Final : Burnley, 3 ; Glossop, 1. LIVERPOOL v STOKE. At Liverpool, before 5,000 spectators. During tha early stages Liverpool bombarded the Stoke foal, Wilkes bringing off some marvellous saves, v'ith occasional breaks away the homesters had all the game, and corners were frequent, but. the was splendid. The wind and sun were 'both against Stoke. Hulf-tiroe : \u2014 Liverpool, nil ; Stoke, nil. Liverpool attacked vigorously in the opening stages of the second half, but the Stoke defence was magnificent. Later Stokes centre and right attacked, the home goal being bombarded with shots, which were cleverly kept out. Nothing was scored all through, and the defence on both sides was superior to the attack. Result : \u2014Liver- pool, nil; Stoke, nil. THE LEAGUE (2ND DIVISION.) MIDDLESBROUGH v LINCOLN CITY. At Middlesbrough before 6.000 sp;cla\"...i% aa soft and treacherous ground.

It has been ascertained that persons suspected j being Dr. Leyd's emissaries hare applied to join the Imperial Yeomanry, presumably with the object of learning all they could about its strength, equipment, and plans. Two men, who are believed have been Boer spies, were on the point of being enrolled, when investigation led to the discovery of their object. An \"Evening News\" reporter went to Suffolkstreet, the headquarters of the new force, to make enquiries the matter. This is the story that was told him by tbe officer charge:\u2014\" What yon have heard is quite true. We are simply being pestered these fellows. There not the least doubt\u2014we have had official confirmation \u2014that they come from Dr. Leyds. They say they have been seme colonial troop of horse, but is easy enough to ss\u00ab through most of them. Two of them, however, were actually accepted; but luckily the first was denounced by his landlord us being one of the disloyal Cape Dutoh. The other one had attempted to steal efficsr s attestation paper, and so was found out. The same thing has happened the cat-eof Thomeycroft's Horse, in which seven spies have been found aod shot. We have given the word to all our officers to keep a sharp look-out for traitors.\" The \"Central News\" says that fewer than 25 emissaries tried gain admission to the force Several men came speaking with a decided Scandinavian accent. They said they were naturalised Englishmen, but could not produce their papers. the present none of those men have been imprisoned, the authorities contenting themselves with turning them away. All the commissioiied officers have been warned to keep a look-out for Boer sympathisers. are asked to contradict statement that Mr. of the Berkeley Troop Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, wsis accepted for active service. THE EQUIPMENT FUNDS. At a meeting Dorchester, on Monday, for the purpose of raising funds for the Dorset Yeomanry and Rifle Volu cteers, a splendid response was made.

{"ocr": "TOPICS OF THE HOUR* There are amongst the Boers BROTHER many who \"would not draw BORRS. * trigger on the British troops.\" These are brother Boers indeed, who are intelligent and high types of manhood, who are not ashamed to confess that the reign of Krugerdom has sig- nally failed, and that it is high time some adequate administrative reforms were brought about. They are unable to leave the country, but Mr. Winston Church- ill says they are our friends. \"A considerable proportion of the Beers,\" he maintains, \"are devoted to the British cause.\" The Boer food supplies are being exhausted, and the grip on Delagoa Bay is being felt. Whilst there is any chance of England taking over the bay the Portuguese will assist the British in their work of seizing arms and ammuni- tion. According to a reliable au- thority, England's right of pre-emption in regard to Delagoa Bay is recognised by the Anglo-German agreement, and the Foreign Office at St. Petersburg is unconcerned as to the terms of the treaty between England and Germany, Russian political interests not being affected in any way. The discussion in the York PRACTICAL City Council Chamber yeeter- SYMPATHY. day on the proposed relief to Reservists' families was extremely creditable to those who took part in it, and reflects credit upon the intelligence of the electorate. The representatives of the ratepayers must have keenly felt the position in which the Reservists' wives are placed financially, and they have, by deciding to deal with the question in a practical man- ner, accurately interpreted the wishes of the ratepayers. Mr Mansfield's touching and manly appeal fou -d an echo in every heart, and the Lord Mayor showed that the spirit animating the promoters of the city funds on behalf of the sufferers by the war are the same. The Corporation have touched upon a point which has been somewhat overlooked, and if a scheme for the paying of rents for the Reser- vists' families in the city could be arranged it will be a work of which the citizens will have every reason to be proud. m* Throughout the kingdom NORTH COUNTRYthere is no sign of slacken- PATRIOTISM. ing of patriotism. Practical proof of it ia being given day by day on every hand, and the North-country keeps well to the front in connection with the movement. Colonel Staveley, of the 2nd Vol- unteer Battalion of the East Yorkshire Regi- ment, in reply to the Earl of Londesborough, the hon. colonel of the regiment, has stated that 300 of the corps are ready for doing gar- rison duty. Indeed, nearly the whole regi- ment on being asked stated they were ready to go anywhere. Colonel Holtby, of Duffield, has offered to go with them wherever the Government desire 3 to have their services. The first Militia Battalion to volunteer for active Bervice was the 3rd Durham Light Infantry, and Lieutenant-Colonel R. B. Wilson, a well known tactician, is to go with them when they embark for South Africa on the 11th inst. The battalion is 1,000 strong, and as the men are mostly colliers and ironworkers from Dur- ham their readiness to go to war on behalf of their Queen and country is an effective reply to the sneer of one of Her Majesty's judges about Durham Englishman. Those who are familiar with the historic records of the county ! know quite well that there are heroes of the ! mine of whose deeds the whole world has j reason to be proud. Yorkshiremen are loyal, ' and they are generous givers to a good cause, j The funds of the Yorkshire Volunteer Equip- j ment and Emergency Fund, of which Mr. i R. E. Beckett, Old Bank, Doncaster, is the j treasurer, now amounts to \u00a35,309. The ! Woman's Contribution Fund originated by ' Miss Milner reaches the sum of \u00a317. The j nobility of the North have made splendid re- sponses to the numerous appeals. \"Well begun is half done.\" A GOOD There is a desire in every BEGINNING grade and in every depart- ment of life to start the New Year well. Sir Thomas Brooke, Bart., who presided at the West Riding Quarter Sessions at Leeds yesterday, was able to congratulate the Grand Jury on the fact that their labours were exceedingly light, for the calendar of crime was the lightest he had ever seen for thirty years. The average for the last five years was twenty prisoners, but yesterday there were only twelve prisoners for trial Probably the explanation Sir Thomas offered for the lightness of the calendar was the right one. When business is brink, men are busy, and their brains are kept from the contempla- tion of evil acts. Idleness always increases crime of the premeditated kind. In the words of the Chairman of the Quarter Sessions, when people are fully occupied there are not the same temptations and inducements to crime. York City needs the electric ELECTRIC LIGHT light badly. High buildings FOR YORK, and narrow thoroughfares naturally make Murdoch's illuminant show to disadvantage, but the ;n- -efficiency of the lighting is not confined to the streets. In old and even in new buildings the fault may lie with the laying of the pipes, and not with the gas Through the ordinary jets a good flame is given, and the light is much purer than the gas supplied to many North-country towns, but there is a fluctuation in the pressure that gives a light that is injurious to the eyes. Eye fatigue is much more prevalent where the gas lights are unsteady through irregularity in the pressure or tlie presence of water in the pipes. The gas pipes hi buildings ought to be fixed under the supervision of the Corporation. The point is an important one for the inhabit- ants. York City stands on a wide area, and on the outskirts the demand on the resources of the gas company are being rapidly over- come, and this may have something to do with the quantity and quality of the gas supplied. York City gas usually attains a satisfactorily high standard of lu- minosity. It is nevertheless pleasing to learn that the delay in supplying the electric light to the city is through no fault of the Electric Lighting Committee. The light, it is expected, will soon be available. \u2014 m\u2014- \u25a0 There are many thousands of WELSH ON Welsh people on Tees-side. TEES-SIDE. One of the founders of the town was a Welshman, and many of the Celtic race to which he belonged have settled in Ironopolis, in South Bank, where the works of Bolckow and Vaughan are situated, and at Stockton. The Welsh are a musical race, and they celebrate New Year's Day in a way of their own. They bold an Eisteddfod, and there is always keen competi- tion amongst the individual soloists and per- formers. The contest between the choiw is always a feature. Mr. David Jenkins, of Aberystwyth, gave awards which were recog- nised aa just and impartial, and his criticisms were as helpful, as luminous, and as good- humoured as hitherto.

Enterprise is characteristic of the Gloooester Rugby Qub. Without it tbry would Dever have reached the potation they hold to-day in the forefront of English football, and without it they would never have troubled about getting an International match played on their ground at Kalmyk\u00b0lm. The officials, however, maimed what an important bearing such a fist tire would hare upon the game, not only in the city, but in the county as well, so they cheerfully feed the responsibilities attendant upon the etimgemeet. To-day, when they have spent over a thou red pounds upon timber alone for the huge stands they are building, they arc most sanguine about the result. Arrangements bans been made to run *early forty excursions into Illineiester alisterdey, and as shou\u2022 belt of these ere coming from Wake, the Principality is expected to contribute 20,000 spectators. If this estimate proves correct, it is not too much to look for as athendanoe of at item 30,1100. Aothinmodatiou has been provided for mote than that neither, and, given a fine afternoon, there is little doubt the capacity of the ground will be tested to its uttermost. Rugby readers will learn with regret of the death of Mr. Tom Faulkner. a former captain of the Tudhoe club, at the early age of 32. Re had been ailing for massy months, and had gone into the infirmary to undergo an operatics, from which he never recovered. Faulloser, who was \u2022 eery quiet fellow, was for many years a member of the Durham Couaty teem, and twine played in the North teem. He also successfully captained the Tudtice team whim they carried off the maim trophy in IEO3. The following is the team chosen to represent the East Midlands in their replayed tie with Kent in the Rugby ruion ('hanipionship, which is to be played at Northampton on January 10: W. J.

The Scottish Football Union has now reelected its beat thirty players, out of which the Scottish fifteen have to be madded. The teams do not contain many surprises. Since the two fifteens were chosen it has become known that Dr. Reid, Bdinburgh Academicals, has sustained such injuries to his shoulder as will prevent him taking any further promiasnt part in football this season. He was considered pretty much of a certainty for the position of full back. Now that he is out of the running Drischotti, Oxford University, stand'. \u2022 fair chance. It is possible, however, that the Union, having rather \u2022 superfluity of talent at three-quarter. may decide to relegate A. R.

Mr. John White reports in his \"Annual Shipping Review \" \" The production of the past year in British shipyards has been about 1,640,000 tons, very nearly Use same total as in 1898. It is a large production, but. as pointed out in my last year's report, when the previous year's output caused many people to anticipate an early collapse in the value of ships and in freights, it will be seen when the figures are analysed that such a fear is not justified, and that the tonnage is not disproportionate to the expansion of trade, shown by the Board of Trade returns, and to the extension of sea carriage. Of the tonnage built last year. about 130.000 tuns represent worships. a very much larger quantity than was formerly built in private shipyartiii; about 47.000 tons sailing vessels. of various types; and about 110,000 tons steam trawlers, tugs, steam yachts, and such craft. Thus, close on 100.000 tons are vessels that do not affect the prospects o; the ordinary merchant steamer.\" We take the following extract from Messrs. Matheson and Grant's half-yearly engineering trades report: 'The year opens with peculiar and unprecedenied conditions. On the one hand, activity in all branches of trade, with enhanced prices and good prospects for the immediate future, on the other band, a war which has cost much in life and treasure, and which has ominous possibilities of further embarrassments. The 6 per cent. Bank-rate of discount and the great fall in the price of Consols are signs of a financial stringency which is likely to limit or forbid many of the e nterprises on which engineers depend. In all the engineering trades the element of time has become of even morz importance than price. Menu. tacturces are unable to take full advantage of the pre\u25aa nt high rates, because they cannot obtain the necessary raw material quickly enough. Midland and Northern coal of the kinds need on railways, at gasworks, and by engineers, is steadily rising in price, n rid where annual contracts are usual, they have been made for 19f0 at rates about 6d per ton higher than t hose of last January. Coke has advanced at a greeter r..tio, and those who are fortunate enough to possess c..ke ovens of a modern kind are reaping large profits. Iron makers. steelmakers, and manufacturing engineers at the present time well able to pay the advanced l'r\u2014^ but railways, gasworks, and electric-supply cora'. a hose revenue is derived from fixed rates, are - us the burden severely.\" M,e,srs. W. Montgomery and Co.'s half-yearly e. r.. re of soda report we learn that the development of nit rate of soda trade continued steadily throughoft year, but in the spring months, owing to the ,!sore of sufficient supplies. is temporary cheek was ' experienced, and u a consequence of such insulicienor wide fluctuations in prices resulted. Deliveries in Europe have again been upon a record soak throughout the year, amounting to 1,140,000 tons, of which 1.017,000 tons have to be credited to the Continent and 123,000 tons to the United Kingdom. an increase over the figures for 1898 of 13 per cent. for the former, and a reduction of 7 per cent. for the latter. As to the supply for the coming season, it may prove insufficient. There is visible today 730,000 tons, of which quantity there may be relied upon to arrive at destination in time for delivery for consumption between Jan. 1 and April 30 next 700.000 tons; add the January and February steamer shipments, say, 45,000 tons, or a total of 745.00) tons. The consumption in same period of 1839 amounted to 670.000 tons, !has !caving an ap_ parent surplus, to cover loss in weight, lon by mar.ne accidents, and stock in ports (which stock can hardly ever fall below 40,000 tons), of only 75,030 tons. The consumption in the United States also shows a steady increase, amounting to 160,000 tons, as against 142,000 tons in 1818. The production in Chili seems to be slightly increasing, and now amounts to 30,500, 000 quintals. or 1,380,000 tons.

Tiie Press .V r-sotiaiion's correspondent at Frcrc ;Camp. telegraphing Sunday 4.25 p.m. says: \u2014 A re- jcr .una -auco was made ye.- lei day from Chieveley j Camp by a squadron cf the South African Light ?? and the Na*al Car.-ibir.cers. Its object i was to ascertain if tbe report that the Bo?rs .\u00bbad left Slaugware Mountain and recrossed the river were true. A party advanced to within two miles of t : _e im untain, a point from which the enemy could bo soon in large numbers. When the order to ietiit- was given the Boers opened fire. Our men retired carefully from | kopje to kopje. They had to cross the plain for a distance r f two hundred yarde, and iiere they | felt tho seventy of tbe Boer fire. They look all covar available, however, and relumed 'o camp without iiaving sustained any casualties. A NIGHT ATTACK ON THE ENEMY TEE ATTACKING FORCE ALL NIGHT IN TEE EAIN. The 'Daily Telegraph's\" correspondent at Frerc Camp in a despatch on Sunday afternoon says. \u2014 Tha intended night bombardment of the Oolerrs \u00bb lines miscarried yesterday. Thorneycrof t * He>rse and the Mounted Infantry advanced to- wards the Tugela, aud tbe Boers dieoovdred them, as was intended, and turning their search- light on the men opened a heavy Manser fire. But r\u00bbur naval guns, which were to have seized tlie f:pj:ortunity at ten o'clock at night to can- nonade '.he enemy's trenches, did not fire It is stated 'liat they waited to hear the musketry, but thai it was inaudible five miles away on a stormy night. So, after un- dergoing much discomfort, and floun- dering in the mud and water, tlie troops re- turned to quarters at Chieveley Camp. Much the same fate befell a reconnoitring foroe in the direction of Mount Langwane. Our squadrons of Volunteers, after much difficulty, located tiie Boers who are now isolated to the south of the Tugela ranges. Colonel Byng's South African Ligh\u00bb Horse, with two guns, proceeded to their assistance, but were unable in darkness to find their way or to effect a junction for nn attack. Men and horse* stumbled and fall into water hobs. They were out all night, gut drenched, and much vexed returned to camp in the morning. FEELING THE~PINOH OF SIEGE AT LADYSMITH. THE SITUATION SEVEKE. A '\u2022Times\" second edition telegram, dated Lad-.-smitb, December 22th, says that for the last ten days the siege has becu marked by little of uperial interest. The enemy maintained a desul- tory shelling until the day before yestorday, wli^n they recommenced the heaviest bombard- ment, of which they are capable. Their practice ghovod considerable accuracy. The casualties latterly have been much heavier, the Devonshire and ?? llegiment* receiving punish- ment. To-day, for some extraordinary reason, the enemy \"have not fired their big guns from the sorrtk. but from explosions beard it is believed that they are dest-roymg the railway between this and Colenso. We are anxiously awaiting definite news from the south. We constantly hear heavy artillery from the direction of tlie Tugela, but as yet trace no move- ment on the part of the enemy. They seem m ocn-tant dread of further sorties, and constantly: open at fire at night along the line of pickets. | The \"arrison are beginning to feel the pmch of siege life. Suspense, sickness, shell fire, and smaller rations tend to make tho situation severe; but all are confident, and prepared to make every sacrifice the circum* Unices may de- mand. THE ENEMYTDREAD OF A NIGHT ATTACK. In a despatch, dated Ladysmith, December ?e*, the \"Morning Post\" correspondent says thai at about lialf past eleven the previous night a ?? of tlie Boer! along the railway near Sur- j pnse Hill opened fire. The fake alarm was taken : -.:\u00bb by tho Boers in force to the south of Surprise I iii!!. Then some more Boers posted on Thorn- I bill's kopjes blazed away violently, revealing I Surprise Hill guarded by three lines of picket* end the enemy in a thoroughly frightened oon- I dition. They fired over 3,000 rounds, to j which we declined to reply, tliough our whole 'force 'tood to arms. The big gun on Telegraph Hill tiied again tins morning at dawn. The naval hatiery \u00ab.n Junction Hill opeiied fire on Bulwaua with 4.7 in. and 12 pounder, not aiming at the gun, but at the gunners, who have been observed leaving tb* casements for the gun every morning. Six shot* were fired within five minutes. The Crsusot i*i Bulwana wa.= silent all day, *j we presume that many gunntrs wore killled. POSITION AT MODDER RIVER. REINFORCEMENTS FOR THE ENEMY. ' Tlie \"Standard's\" special correspondent at M odder River telegraphs on December 26th : \u2014 This morning the 9th Lancers, one fquadron of the 12^Lancers, and G Battery with Mounted Infantry, reconnoitred on both flanks. On our right the Mounted Infantry and a company of Sapoers blew up Nirke, skahouse, on the l>end of the Moddor Biver. While th^ operations were being carried out the enemy fired sheik from the bg gun posted on the comer kopje. Iwo of our xaen were hit on our left centre. Tlie cavalry moved forward close to tiie enemy, drawing fire from several new positions, and ascertaining that the Boers had mounted a couple of big guns, one on each side of th c railway opposite our naval 4 7 battery. In advance of these the crnon on the east of the line; two Maxim Nordenfelt guns fired several rounds at the cavalry. Further still to the East on the kopje, which juts out in a southerly direction, is a gun apparently to run on rails.

A letter from Private John Richley. who is with Lord Methjon's force on Modder River, lias been received by his father, who resides at Loftus. Private Richley is in the Ist North- umberland Fusiliers. The writer gives an in- teresting account of the Modder River battle, which he describes as a big battle in which we had an awful lot killed and wounded. It lasted thirteen hours and a half\u2014 a long time to go without your breakfast, which we got about half- past eight at night. V.'c gave tbe Boers a good hiding though, and the place is full of their dead and wounded. It is the longest and hardest, fight on record. The Boers thought we could not beat them, but we soon showed them different. They had a very good position, but we drove them out of it, I had two of my mates wounded, but not serious, I shot six myself. They were firing on the wounded and hospital, tbe mean beggars. I was tak'ng snap shots at Uienx I am tired of this I can toll you and I am going to get out of it as soon as I can, but you can trust me to doing my duty while lam \"here. Thero are some horrible sights to ceo on a battlefield I can tell you. We will be in Kimberley by the time you get this if all goes well. It is awful hot here through the day. Our regiment has lost 103 killed and wounded. I vvas very sorry to liave to shoot them poor fellows, but if I had not shot them they would have shot me. A MIDDLESBROUGH YOUTH'S EXPEDIENCES.

The Pr* jtion's Military correspon- dent <r>y xist year has witnessed the ojieuiuf .d the opening- stage only, of I \u00bb\"hat, history cf tbe campaign comes j to b ii ill prove to by. the most remark- ?? crimps, the nv'st exhausting, war If \" 'O \u2022 The conditions under which we arf> n ;g ore so extraordinary that it is not at j all remarkable if tho calculations of generals hive boon bowled over. The time has now come when our (>est strategists have to p-.xuet^ that ihe theories based upon the camppjirns of the past have been completely up- set, and only tactics devised to meet the require- ments of tho hour can be of any avail in dealing with what has proved to be a powerful enemy so far from our shores. From the very first indica- tion of hostilities we have been pouring thousands of our best troops into South Africa, troops who, under ordinary conditions in a European war, and against fairly equal numbers, would have given a splendid exhi bition of their fighting qualities. Unhappily, we have had during the last few weeks a terrible object- lesson, not so much in ihe maitcr of casualties, although that has been bad enough, but in the ques- tionable policy of sending regiment after regiruent of infantry to the front. Late as it is in the day to recogivise the mistake \u2014 and cur leading military experts arc the first to adnvt that a mistake has been made \u2014 we are now Bending to South Africa a force which, in the oouree of a few weeks, should do more to drive the Boers back to their \"wn territory than our infantry lias bee i able to do with all its efficiency and discipline. We ha^e not yet, probably, fully realised how much we are indebted t ) tbe colonies for the magnificent contributions of men and money. The f oraier are cf the utmost value, and before the campaign has gone much further there i 3 Utile doubt that tha Government will avail themselves to the full extent of tlie generous offers which have l\u00ab\"jn made from all part* of the Empire. The Irregu- lar Forces from the Colonies are just what are required, supported, of courve, by powerful artillery. GERMANY AND THE WAR, GEJiEKAL BULLES A \" FATHEAD. 1 ' An Englsh student residing at Beriin, writing to a Middlesbrough ccllegue, says: \u2014 ''As you will no doubt know, the Germans, along with other Europ.:-a.!i countries, are in favour of tha Biters. At present the German papers only tako ex- tracts from the London Press remarks, but at the beginning of the war they made many re- marks about \"Old John Bull,\" but 1 cannot re- member what were tho exact words, and as the papers are now destroyed 1 am afraid I cannot oblige you with any interesting <\u00abuttings. I liave seen one or two pictures in the oomuc papers re- lating to the South -African Wax. Ono repre- sented John Bud having found a big box, and is makuig arrangeuienta to carry it away, when a big Boer junii>s out and shoots him dead. An- other represents Paul Jxrager sitting tun Queen Victooza's head, etc After recuiviiig the nowe of the British defeats the opinion m Germany now is that every \"blooming Britisher\" will be swept out. They rail Buller a quatchkopf\u2014- i.e., a fathead or something of that sort. One paper sticks up for the English. It says 'Why should we be hateful to the Engkish. If they take over the Transvaal, they wt.ll then be our neighbours, and a great deal oould then be done in the way of opening a great trade in South Africa. ' They refer to Gearman Eaat Africa. The Germans give their reason of the war to be that England wants a lot more land and money, and in their opinion we have quite enough al- ready. Thoy say that it is inevitable that we have a war with Russia. 'It must come; it may be now, or it may be in ten or in twenty years.' The Russians meet us evorywliere: In China, in India etc., and to be able to meet the Rui-dans we (the English) must have more money ; theie- fcre we try to get it from the Transvaal, hiding our real intention by saying that the war is in the cause of the Outlandev* who have been so badly treated by the Boors. Thus tends the opinion of tho German nation. They seem very much afraid of America being 90 friendly with us. Several concerts, etc, have been held, the re- ceipts being given to a fund for the Boors.\" LATEST TELEGRAMS. SUCCESSFUL ATTACK BY GEN. FEENOH. BOER POSITION SHELLED. Naauwport, Saturday. The Central News .-pecial correspondent says : \u2014 Tho Boors during last night abandoned their p< sit ions north of Arundel, and fell back to (3olesberg. Tlie movement was quickly followed up by General French at daybreak to-day. A strong force of cavalry and horse artillery followed tlie track of the Boers, and came up with them a little tii is side of Colesberg. Their positon was shelled effectively for some time They made no reply to our hie. and are clearly demoralised by our unexpected movement. They fe-ulferod considerably from tlie artillery fire. The enemy are undoubtedly considerably disturbed by the tactics of Genoral Freuoh, who gives them no rest 2,000 BOERS ADVANCE (JPON DORDRECHT. BRITISH PATROL FIRED UPON. AN ENGAGEMENT IMMINENT.

Thgy were sighted about mid-day. da enemy were occupying a good position upon a precipitous ridge, about three miles outside tiie toen, Tho detachment was sent to work around the Boers' flank, while the rest sought cover in too donga in front. The Boers nullified tlie latter movement, by occupying another ridge which overlooked the donga. They poured hot fire nito the donga, but ?? no harm, i Meanwhile the detachment sent to outflank the enemy had woiked round to the rear, <uid they drove the Boers back from their position. At this moment a eirorrg body arrived to reinforce tho Boor?, and we were compelled to fall back. A party of the Cape mounted police, number- ing about a hundred, arrived soon after, but ductly they appeared on the field a Eliell fiom a big gun which the Byers had brought up fell near tlie town. It was clear that the enemy numbered quite 1,500, and had artiilory. Tbe whole force, therefore, retired, keeping good order. The Boers kept up a per- sistent fire at long ranges during the retirement, but our casualties are very slight, if, indeed, any- one was hit. The enemy had several killed and wounded. The whole force has now taken up a goood defensive position outside the town in readiness to resist the Boers' attack. PARTY OF BRITISH SOLDIERS RESCUED. A force from Dordrecht under Captain Golds- worthy, to-day encountered th\u00a9 Bocra near Dor- , drecht, and drovo them back, and rescued a British party left behind during yesterday's operations. THE DEFENCE OF THE TUGELA. BOERS FORMING ANOTHER CAMP CONFIDENT OF THEIR STRENGTH Tho Central News' special correspondent at Frcro Camp, writing on Sunday evening, fays: \u2014 Our scouts Lave learned that the Boers are making important alterations in 1 1 cir ph jis for the defence of ?? Tugela River. Yesterday they brought in tho news of the formation of a new Boer camp to the W-38&. The caravan of 31 wagons was seen desoending from tho plateau beyond the river into a hilly cully, etc.. where, if the camp were eafcly established, it would bo quits invisible. Immediately upon tho receipt of this news the party of Thorneytrvft's H\u00abtso went out for fur- thor observation. They counted altogether 53 wags' ns mailing for tie spot- chosen. Behind them was a bugiry drawn by five cream coloured horses, and accompanied by a mounted escort. This w<s presumably tho equipage of General Joubcrt. This new \"Boer camp is in th\u00a9 Upper Tngola, to- wards Springfield. The movement, taken with ihe prolonged silence from Umbulwaua, thews that a ronyidcrabio alteration has been made in tho Boer line cf rosistar.ca.

One of our doctors, who went into the Boer lines afier the Tugela battle to attend to tbe British wounded, has returned, and reports that tho Boers liave a good sup-ply of food. Tho enemy are quite confident of main- taining their position against any infantry, in the world. The doctor found among the Boers many speaking English. Among those serving the enemy he saw an ex-lieutenant in the army, who was cashiered for misconduct, and an ex- serge-jit in the army, who deserted after beiiig reduced to the ranks. SHELLING THE MODDER RIVER CAMP. 'Ifio I'.\u00ab\u00abrs have resumed their desultory shell- ing of our positions here. Thoy have up to the present fired over 300 rounds without damage. Modder River, Saturday. The naval guns planted a few excellently-aimed shells on the Boer positions yesterday and to- day; enemy made no reply. Thero are evidences that tho enemy's force* on tbe loft aire consider- ably vvoakenod, if not altogether withdrawn. ATTEMPT TO CDTDE AAR RAIL- WAT. A message from Cape Town, Dec 29, rays the British camp at Victoria Weet was alarmed last evening by a sharp oxehange of fire with a body of the enemy, whose object Appeared to be to cut the railway. Further particulars forwarded from Victoria \"West, Dec. 29, rhow thrvt at h?lf-pnst six last evening, cur picket v mo in from tho kopje beyond tbe station, and reported that they hod ben fired upon. Tbey had seen a patrol oi Boors going north-east. The camp was lrvarned to hold itself in readiness. At 9 o'clock shots ware heard in the direction of Viotoria-road Station. The alarm was sounded. The whole camp turned out, and tbe troops were posted. Tbe firing became very heavy, bullets whistling in all directiona, and it was renewed later on. A patrol despatch at daybreak reported that the enemy had disappeared. Their evident intention was to out ihe railway. Sunday. BOERS ATTEMPT TO CREEP TO THE BRITISH GUNS. The \" Standard's \" special correspondeaifc at Modder River, telegraphing on December 30, says : At half -past ssix last night the enemy's guns fired six diets in tbe direction of the guards' outposts on our right. Yesterday a party of the Bocra crept under cover of bushes to within sixteen hundred yards oi onr 4.7 guns. They concealed their ponies and took up the position underneath a railway culvert. Some Lancers and a picket of the Highlanders tried to cut tiiero off, but titoy were on the alert, and, mounting their ponies, managed to scamper away. The naval guns have been filing at intervals to-day. Tlie enemy remain quiet. Tt appears that owing to tho largo numbers of the Ist Durham Light Infantry, who liave volun- teered to go to the front in South Africa, it is ex- pected that there will be several vaoano : es in the headquarters Stockton companies. Volunteers. are asked for to fill those vacancies, and keep up the detachment to its full strength. Preference will bo given to those who liave already done seme training. TO-DAY'B WEATHER FORECASTS.

WHEN DOES THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BEGIN ? Th 3 ?? about tlie beginning of the new century, which is agitating some minds not wli/oby absorbed by the war news, is no new one, say; a correspondent of the \" Manoliester Guar- dian.\" It is at least w old aa tlie days of the. Italian Renaissance. Indeed. a German con- temporary, who writes on tlvs subject, and who appears to have gone into it with the usual pains- taking euerjry which wo associate w th German research, tells us that even before the birth of Christ the Roman annalist Piso, who was Consul in the year 153 8.C., speaks of the queetion whether the century ended with the 100:h year or with the 99th. About the year 1603 a memorial coin was struck bearing the significant iii*oription : \u2014 \"O wonder of wonders 1 in the year 1600 the people did not know how old they were!\" Again, in the year 1799 controversy rose so high in Germany that in Woimar two parties formed called the \" Ninety -nines \" and the \"liundreda,\" and it is noteworthy that both Schiller and Goethe belonged to the first -named. One could hardly expect poets to lie mathemati- cians. Schiller, however, though he wrote a pr-oai to commemorate the event, afterwards, as appears from a letter wliioh he wrote to Gotta, proved a renegade and went over to tlie \"Hundreds.\" At least he seat in If 01 lis congratulation for the new^pemtury. The Council ?? fixed the date of tho birth of Christ in the year 75*. The era was baeea on the calculations of Dion,* Boa and though later research proved Dkmysius to r^c been some three years in error, neither Church nor people oared to alter the calendar. The custom ..of reckoning by the Christian era, as we now understand it, became fully pstablwhed by a decree cf Charlemagne, who began wit'i 800: this year was generally accepted to inaugurate the ninth century- The Reman Catholic Ohuroh has always adherer] to this reckon- ing. Ir 1300 Pope Bonif xc VI fI. established tha Jubilee year, which was to i<vur every 100 ?? and, in aenordanoo with that 'rcckoniusr, Leo XIII lias decreed that 1500 shall be a Jubilee In Russia, where tho Christian era was introduced later, namely in 1700. that year was again token to begin the century. So it follows that, accord- ing to all accepted custom, the year 1800 begins the now century, and this method of reck on \"ng certecnly has simplicity and convenience to re- commend it.- It is, however, quite clear that such reckoning is not mathematically correct. In order to count ten we must have ten complete, and similarly we must have 100 years completed before we have one century. Hence the second century cannot liave be- gun till the yeir 101. and the 20th begins with 1901. This ir. the view that tnathe- matioans have always taken of the matter; L ; **re gives this view in his dictionary; and Arago. the well-known astronomer, is on the same side. But here our ingenious German finds a loophole in the fact that, after hB, we do not date from the birth of Christ, but from the date of His circumcision. What, he asks, became of the seven days intervening between the two events? He suggests, by way of reply, that the 19th century can be made to end on tbe 25th December, 1899, and the 20th century to begin on the Ist January. 1900. And so both parties can be reconoilad.

One was the right of tlio worker to be a participator in tlio proceeds of his industry ; the second wiii . the recogniti-on tliat the evolution of society req ' . tired that in Glasgow they should live in conditions which would be calculated to develop not only tlieir material interests but ( heir artistic , intellectual , and social faculties as well ; and the third thought was tliat it was -a duty to their community to train their chiidren in a milliner calculnted to improve tlioir bodies as well 85 their minds . That they should have \u2022 organised their festival on tlieso lines reflected the greatest credit on the progressive spirit which animated tlieir community . The Soottyi Cooperative Societies seemed to recognise that the worker had a right by the reason of service rendered to a direct share in the net profits of his industry . They were the principles of justice and humanity and also of expediency . One of the points of Scottish co-operation was that tlie management interested the worker and made linn recognise that ho wus a partner in lllo concern . It must bs plain to every thinking man that the tendency of Hie ' age was in favour of tha consolidation of industry . Tho reason was that they were able to reduce the expenses < rf management in relation to output , but wliilo there were also many more advantages there were also great dangers which they liad to face . The result of Ihe consolidation of industries into one or two ha . ricis was that tho market could bo so controlled tliat tlicy could not resist the temptation of controlling affairs so as to enrich themselves at the expense of the community . The advantage of the system practised by the co-operators in Glasgow was that they cou'olidated tho industries without tho interests at tfco community boing in diuigcr . Tho tendency of tho aire kine in favour of industrial consolidation And tho oo-operativo system practised in Glasgow being tho only method by which that principle could ! lie properly applied , ho looked forward to a , stoadr growth 'in Scottish cooperation . . 1 .

The Oonumttea of foe Imperial Yeomaoiy . movement issued last overime the following notification :--\"A lotter TO ? looaived by tho Secretary on Monday morning from Sir Dighton Probvn , saying Hi \u00ab Royal Highness the Prince of 'Wales vas taking tho keenest interest in the raising of the Imperial Yeomanry force for eervico in South Africa . Hit Royal Highness also asked for information as to the probaMe date of tho departure of frbo firet detachment , as he was taost aasaous lo personally inSpCOt ai least some part oE tho { oroe . \"The offices have again been thronged all d \u00bb y with visitors .. Everything is progressing most satisfactorily . \"The remonni department is rerf busy , and is progressing satisfactorily . \" The Press Associationas tho result of inquiries , is in a position to say that persons suspected of being Dr Leyds' emisEanea have applied to join the Imperial Yeomanry , presumably with the objwt of learning all they could about its strength , equipment , and plans . A couple of supposed Botr spies were actually enrolled , or about to bo enrolled , when their bonafides came into question , and investigation led to the cutting short of their yeomanry career . There is a strong suspicion that the catcrprising Dr Leyda is at the bottom of the little plot . It is admitted that suspicious circumstances have led to the exercise of g-reat care , and ftll the officials connected in any way with the enrolment will keep a sharp look-out for any candidates who may appear to be actu&ted by ulterior motives . The Central Authority ia not yet in a position to giro the total number of chrolniente at the different centres or the aygrsga-te of them all ; ttrt they are quite satisfied that good progress is bfilig made . Sir George' Arthur , formerly of the Life Guards , is doing good service to the Committee at the home centre in the way of receiving and interrogatiag candidates and passing them on to the proper quarters . Each man is closely questioned as to his record , health , character , and ability to ride and shoot welL Their replies are not taken on trust , but an actual test of their capabilities is arranged for . They are directed to their respective headquarters for riding and shooting tests , and it is understood these mil be most rigorous . The Centra ! News Bays : \u2014Lord Chesham ' s staff have detected what appears . to bo an attempt by Boer emissaries to \u2022 enlist in the Imperial Yeomanry . A number of foreigners have presented themselves at the headquarters and offered to enlist . On Saturday no few than twenty-five thus tried to gain admission to the force . In all but two cases , after sharp crosa-examination , they were turned away . The two were actually enrolled , but were found out before attestation . Is is believed on good grounds that this is the work of Dr Leyds . Severel men came in speaking with' a decided Scandinavial accent . They said rkey were naturaliseo . JEc ^ Us !! - men , but could not produce their papers . Up to tte present none of these men have been irbprisonei , the authorities contenting thempelves with tunuig them away .

We loft camp at four o ' clock morning , name into oontnot with tlio enemy a . boiit six , and the battle lasted until after nine o ' clock at night . It was no child ' s play . The buDets wore flying thickly over our heads , and the bursting of the slieris was somothinB terrible . Tlio Boon wore in position on Modder River , and we had to advance in tlio face of a tremendous fire . They held tlheir position for five or six hours , and it mis with groat difficulty that wo managed . to shift tliem . Our regiment was Hie first to cross tlie nver on the loft flank , and my compa . ny was Uie first to get over . Wo advanced along the river and drove the Boers before us ; but , iro . fortima'tely , our bip pins dropped two or thrco ahnlls uncomfortably dose to 119 , entirely by mistake . 'When the first ot Uic ? e sliolla toll , I was only about leil yards past the spot . About twenty of our men wore killed by the Boer bullets ; . and our regiment , I think , sustained the heaviest loss of any that took part in the ficht . I felt , 1 , bit frightened when I first went into battle , but as the day advanced I got myself again- My legs are badly burned by tho Eun , and are very aoro , 'but I am rapidly getting aD right again . We expect to have another fight this week , and it will bo oven worse than the lastso one never knows tho hour when ho may fall , bat I hope I may get through safe and sound .

An inquest was held yesterday on the bodies of the passengers who were killed in tlie railway collision at Wivelsfield Station, on the London, Brighton, and South-Coast line, on Saturday week. Ilia jury found that the deceased were killed in the collision, \u2022nd that it waa an accident, partly due to the driver Westlake not obeying his rules, and to the ignorance of the signalman.

The area of the British Empire was yester- day increased by nearly half-a-million square miles, this growth being due to the assumption by the Colonial Office of the territories hitherto governed by the Royal Niger Company. The American Government's negotiations with the other Powers on the subject of the open door policy in China have had most grati- fying results, although the replies received will not be published at present.

{"ocr": "NEW-COURT CHAPEL. The pastor, the Rev. G. Campbell Morgan, occupied the pulpit at the watch-night service this church, and, preaching crowded congregation from the 9th verse of the 90th P\u00abalm \" To bring our years to end as tale that is told -remarked that the closing moments of the year were always full of solemnity ; and it was noticeable that the solemnity took hold of the hearts of all sorts ond conditions of people. As the ykar took its way the last moment they seemed to be brought the very force of circumstances face to face with the uncertainty of life, with the vital importance and tremendous issues that seemed lie within the bosom every year. They stood there in the last minutes of the year recognition of the fact that their life hod not been wholly made up of things material. At a time like that memory was busy, and hope was active. While there had been failures in the pa\u00ab*t year, they thanked God also for Its victories. There bad been bright days and dark days, and who had not to look back on some day of failure? In further elaborating upon his teat, the rev. gentleman mentioned that although their tears could never take the stain of sin away, the blood of Christ had done that. They looked back upon the time when they had erred with sorrow and contrition. Out of the roughness the way Christ was bringing them into the smooth path, and ont of the loneliness he was giving them to know what comradeship with God meant. If memory was busy in bringing up the past, hope was busy in painting the future, before; prayers prayed then would help and victories, larger service, and noble life. Life was a tale, volume one being probation, and volume two destiny. The first lie was writing himself, every moment that was passing wrote something his life\u2019s record. Every year that was past bad been one chapter in the history of their lives, and they could not undo or obliterate it. In an eloquent peroration the rev. gentleman asked what they were going to do with the new chapter of life which was opening before them? God was waiting to an inspiration ond a power to each one of them, and if they would let him he would guide their hand*. Their past might have been unworthily written, but God tvould blot it out. and then they could face the future that was breaking upon them.

But can you shoot a Boer at 800 yards without seeing him ?\" \" Well, air, 11l try,\" was the prompt reply. All the appllmints are interrogated as to age. One of them on Saturday did not quite appreciate the question, and apologetically inquired, \"What did you say, sir ?\" The officer varied the inter. rogatory by facetiously remarking, \"We must be sure about the Ann Domini. \" Oh,\" innocently replied the recruit, \"money is no object, sir, not in the least.\" The laughter which ensued made the applicant SUSPECT THAT HE HAD PUT HIS FOOT L'irTO IT SOMEHOW. That. he weaker sex often entertain hazy notions respecting military titles was evidencA on Saturday. A lady called to ascertain wit , - there her son bad been chosen, and on rejoining her oomparrion outside she was asked whether he bad succeeded or not. She replied, \"Olt. yes,\" and then added, \"My husband, of course, would not think of letting Algy go out as a private in the Volunteers. But he is going as a trooper in the Yeomanry. That is ewer so much nicer, you Lerow.\" it is hoped that at least 1.200 homes may he shippel to the Cape this week. They will thus overcome the effects of the voyage and become fit for work by the time the first draft of Imperial Yeomanry remitters the seat of war. Bucks is doing its duty. Sufficient men have enlisted to ensure the establishment of two companies representing 261 officers, non. commissioned officers, and, men. One company will mobilise at ' theloounty town under Captain de Winton, of the Royal Bucks Huisere, and the other at High Wycombe, under Captain W. A. W. Lawson, late of the Scots Guards. Colonel the Hon. 0, S. Craven, Cowman. dant of the Royal Berkshire Yeomanry, has obtained perudasion from the War Office as , thorities to provide a complete company for the Inapirnd, Yeomanry from Berkshire, and not in conjunction with the Middlesex Yes manly, as was at first proposed. A company is therefore being formed entirely of Berkshire men under Berkshire officers, and those de sirens of joining should communicate with Gatt o : d in Waring, Remnant Grange, Reading. Alwyne Compton, M.P., for Novll Beds, organiser of the local Yeomanry carp, had a grand reception on Saturday morning al Bedford Midland Station, when he met our 100 smart men, who fell in, headed he the ban, of the 3rd Bedfordshire Regiment. The party proceeded direct to the barracks for enrotmen and medical examination. It was only week since Lord Alwyne Compton started t, raise the corps His lordship will take ore the command, other officers being Captait pandas and the Hon. F. Stanley.

A - AT. m \u2022 PARIS, Stjxdat Night. 1 t^ c J Se,ne Assiaea on Saturday, the trial concluded of eleven young men who were arrested m the course of the Anarchist demon- stration organised by M. Sebastian Faure on the 20th of August last, when the Church of St. Joseph was broken into and pillaged. The prisoners throughout the trial denied the accusations made against them, and pleaded tnat it was by accident that they happened to be m the vicinity of the church, or that they were merely there as spectators. The Jury, who deliberated for two hours, found four of the prisoners not guilty, and considered the charges against the seven others as proved. In every case,with theexception of a young Algerian, named Benhaim, a student at the Ecole Cen- tred, extenuating circumstances were recorded. \\\\ hen called upon to plead, Benhaim declared that he was innocent. The Court might inflict the maximum penalty on him if it chose, but, pointing to the crucifix, he declared. \"By that crucified Jew, I swear that I am innocent.\" Whilst the Court was deliberating as to the penalty to be inflicted, one of the condemned prisoners, named Fontana, snatched the bayonet belonging to one of the guards and endea- voured to commit suicide. It took five guards to overpower him and take the weapon from him. Finally, the Court returned, and the prisoners were sentenced to terms of imprison- ment varying between one and two years, but Benhaim was sentenced to five years' solitary confinement. As soon as the Judges had given this decision, the Jury signed a petition hi favour of a pardon being accorded all the prisoners. Prince Waldemar of Denmark on arrival at Bangkok, on Saturday, was received by the King of Siam and all the Princes. After a royal welcome the Prince was conducted to his apartments in the Vangsaronrom Palace. Yesterday his Majesty received the Prince in the Royal Palace, and welcomed him in a speech in which he expressed his regard for the Danish Royal family. Prince Waldemar thanked the King for his cordial reception in Siam, which, he said, was united to Denmark by so many ties of friendship. \u2022 King Alexander of Servia left Vienna yester- day morning for Belgrade. Prince Henry of Prussia left Bangkok on Friday. Prince Hohenlobe, the Imperial Chancellor, returned to Berlin yesterday evening. The marriage of Captain Bernard Ramsden- James, East Surrey Regiment, son of Mr. J. H. James, of Kingswood, Watford, with Angela Mary, eldest daughter of Sir Ughtred Kay- Shuttleworth, Bart., M.P., took place in St. Bartholomew's Church, Barbon, Kirkby Lons- dale, Westmoreland, on Saturday. The bride- groom was attended by his brother, Mr. Godfrey James, as best man, while the bride's three sisters, the Misses Nina, Rachel, and Catherine Kay-Shuttleworth, acted as bridesmaids. The Rev. J. Llewellyn Davies and the Rev. J. Harrison were tho officiating clergy. After the ceremony a luncheon was given at Barbon Manor, and later Captain antl Mrs. Ramsden- Janies left for Kingswood, Watford. The Marquess of Lothian is reported to be in a critical condition. He was taken to his house, Grosvenor-square, from Monteviot, Jedburgh, about two months ago, and under- went an operation. He has been in low con- dition ever since. Mr. Rudyard Kipling is confined to his room at Black Rock, near Brighton, with a slight attack of influenza. His wife and two chil- dren are suffering from the same complaint. Lord and Lady Londonderry, who are at present staying at Wynyard Park, Stockton- on-Tees, will leave for Ireland about the 7th inst. Viscount Castlereagh received on Saturday at Wynyard Park, the residence of his father, the Marquess of Londonderry, Deputations from nineteen representative Associations in the county of Durham, who presented him with addresses and plate, in commemoration of his recent coming of age and marriage, the pre- sentation having been postponed on account of tho accitlcnt to tho recipient in August. Lord Castlereagh left Stockton for London last night to rejoin his regiment. Lathy Castlereagh was not able to accompany him as she is suffering from a chill, which also prevented her atten- dance at the presentations to her husband on the previous day. Our Madrid Correspondent telegraphs that the Gazette on Saturday published in full the revision of the tariff duties and classifications of imports carrieel out in virtue of the recent tax voted by the Cortes, and that they come into force to-day, except in cases where it can be duly proved that the imports have been shipped or forwardeel overland before this new tariff was gazetted. Tlie revision chiefly affects manufacturing interests, sugars, ancl other Colonial protlucts, but reduces the duties on tea, spices, and raw petroleum, antl modifies the rules as to certificates of origin and transit. The Bishop of Chester preached a memorial sermon in the Old Church at Eccleston yesterday morning on the eleath of the Duke of Westmin- ster. The congregation included the Duchess of Westminster, Princess Adolphus of Teck, the Marquess and Marchioness of Ormonde, Lady Lettice Grosvenor, Countess Grosvenor, Lord and Lady Shaftesbury, and Lord Hugh Grosvenor.

That from another paint of view', however, the Royal University results arc remarkable. In the three tabulated no than 252 out tetri of who took the degree of A, either studied ii\u00bb colleges or schools not associated with the University or studied privately. 1 find that very many other colleges and school*,*\u2019 in Ireland have sent students various Arts examinations of the University. considerable number of these colleges and schools have been brought into existence or been given great impctiv* the Royal University and have acquired sort of vested right to degrees in Arts by examination which Parliament cannot justice ignore. For the first University examination in Arts in the summer 1899 there were 48, for the second University examination in Arts 32, and for the 17 such institutions which sent students who passed the resjieetive examinations. I may remark that it wcmW appear tha the lir's colleges intimately with the Fnivenrity seem to l\u00bbe chiefly resorted lo in Arts students desirous obtaining honor* and prir.e*. whilst the other colleges and schools are resorted to chiefly those merely desirous of pass degrees. The inference from this I would draw is that the throe Queen\u2019s Colleges, the Catholic l'n ; - rersity College, and Magee College, are recognised as I\u2019niveraity Colleges derated higlter study and research. The injury to the Arts Schools of the Q(ic(-n\u2018> Colleges, in relation to the number o* students, is mainly owing the opening of the arts degree to all comers, and not the constitution of the boards of examiners in the Royal University, or the predominant of the University College, Dublin, for the number of private student*, and of students from \u201cother colleges and schools.\u201d who pass for the B.A. degree, are one and h.id times great that from all the privileged colleges put together. With a cont.nuar.ce of the prseent system, there r.r reasonable probahilitv that the Queen's Colleges will l\u00bbe any better point nura- in the future than in the past. this Royal, as in other UDiversities, the scholastic attainments necessary to obtain degree in arts are mot of a very prohfbHive character, and. doubt, especially in the literary aide of the arts faculty, very im nv of the schools and colleges are quite able prepare efficiently students for tlie pass examinations. No doubt, \u201cgrinding'\u201d prevails to con| extent, but thnt will always exist under any system. The control the exeruinations in the hands examiners, who \u2022ire teachers in five colleges associated with the University, and it for them corduct the examinations as make it uiftcmlt for the crammed student to pass. It must admitted that the Queens Colleges are not well officered for the training of juniors backward student*. Tnere are tutors or assistant profeasors as there ought to be, and if the importance of the cottages to estimated by the number students in arte it will never come high, unless the altermtkanof ITniverslty arrangements, and college ovgsmsathm. the Queen\u2019s Colleges and suukr imtitu- of tbo number studonto, bo looked upon. boon rtf, National importance in up the standard of bibber education, nfierding opportunity for original work i research, and giving ton* to the education country- institutions should sue plied with no niggardly hand. Their Kv:entific departments should supplied with laboratories aud apparatus, without regard to cost, and chairs endowed so liberally a.s to make the professors independent of the fees obtained from voluntary classes. It is evident things cannot remain they arc. The Queen\u2019s colleges founded hr the Government have been starved the Government. They have been treated ai little Government departments, ruled really bv subordinates in Dublin, been the EubjecU of perpetual intrigues, chiefly political and religious. This perpetual control and Interference the Government have prevented anv real interest being taken b? the people in the colleges, and whilst starved the Government, the colleges hav\u00ab not received, might have been expected, voluntary aid any mateiial extent. I have learned on good authority that the Belfast College lost about quarter of a million, and at least one other intended I benefaction its Government connection. Attempts to settle the question of higher education in Ireland have been lamentable failures, and any further attempts on similar lines would have like .esult. The proposal of Mr Balfour to establish sectarian universities with nun-sectarian names has less chance now of commeadinc itselt tc. the voters the Kingdom than it had last vear, and Ido not th : nk that the present powerful Government would carry measure to endow even denon.inational colleges, not to speak of universitit\". might be worth while to plan. the Government gave Local Government to Ireland municipal and tount.i affairs, why not try it in modified form lor Mileses. Make the Queen s college*, as far as possible, representntire in their gor'min* bodies; give the college* a proper c ndowraent : cut them off from Government interference in their management, ana so prevent the intriguing and wire-pulling; let the people hare real interest the colleges, and then they would take a pride in them, and endeavour to advance their interests. If the North of Ireland would hare Board to please itself, the West and South of Ireland the same. under such conditions. see no reason why the Queen\u2019s Colleges of Belfast, Cork, and Galway should not please all parties, and attain a degree of usefulness, and position in science and literature which Ireland might proud. not see that any politician of any sort whatever ivould reasonably object to <uch a measure for re-organising the Queen'i College*, and putting them on hroad, popular basis. If the principle were accepted the details could arranged. Presidents are not wanting. The governing board might conlain representatives of the teachers and cl the graduates, official representatives ol some public bodies, and eminent person* in thorough sympathy with the colleges. The colleges on tnis plan would really become what they should be\u2014the people's colleges. While the Queen\u2019s Colleges have been injured ami the teachers have suffered serious the establishment of the Royal University. I pretty confident, but I would not like to prophecy, that University education of an excellent type will lie more widely extended than it ever con. have been under the old Queen * University ami that the Queen's College* under local control and in harmony with the views the community for whose use they have been founded might easily develop into colleges with residences and all the advantages of residential college life which some educationalists prize ?o highly. There is no reason why. under new conditions the college*- should not provide with residential halls private beneficence. The Government will certainly never provide such halls and private person* are not likely to do under any Government management. 1 have purposely avoided dealing with tn\u00ab medical faculty which stands on a positor quite different from the arts faculty. Were the Colleges in the position they ought to be then a reorganisation of the Koval University, after the manner ih\u00ab London University, ght be seriously entertained.\u2014Your obedient servant, Wm.

{"ocr": "ST. JAMES\u2019S GAZETTE. POLITICS AND PERSONS. The New Year\u2019s Honours List is this year somewhat meagre. Only two new peerages have been conferred, three privy councillors have been created, and a few knighthoods of very great distinction are announced. The most popular honour will, doubt, be the peerage conferred upon Sir John Lubbock, the founder of our public holidays. He the fourth holder of the baronetcy, which was created in 180 G, and the head of the well-known banking firm of Robarts, Lubbock, and Company. Born on April 30, 1834, he succeeded his father in 18Gu, and five years later became M.P. for Maidstone, for which constituency he sat for ten years. Since the severance of his connection with Kent he has represented London University without intermission. fen years ago he was the Chairman of Public Accounts\u2019 Committee, and has sat on Royal Commissions for the Advancement of Science, on Public Schools, on International Coinage, on Gold and Silver, and on Education and in 1881 he was president of the British Association in the year its Jubilee. For twenty-five years he was Secretary of the London Bankers, and has been prominently connected with University Extension; the London County Council, of which he was successively Chairman and vice- Chairman, and has been the prime mover in all the great bankers organisations. Sir John Lubbock is the author of many scientific, homiletic, and didactic books, the chief among them l>eing The Pleasures of Life,\u201d The Uses of Life,\u201d and The Beauties of Nature.\u201d Sir John is a great authority on ant life, and has embodied his knowledge and the results of his researches in such books as The Senses of Animals,\u201d and fhe Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects.\u201d Several of his books on the ancient vestiges and remains of man have been very valuable contributions to the study of anthropology. These include The Origin of Civilisation and the Primitive Condition of Man,\u201d and \u201cPrehistoric limes, illustrated by Ancient Remains, and the Manners and Customs of Modern Savages.\u201d The other new peer is Sir Henry Stafford Northcote, who a few weeks ago was appointed Governor of Bombay. Iwo sons of the great Sir Stafford Northcote will now have seats in the Upper House\u2014one being the Earl of Iddesleigh, and the other the new peer. Sir H. Stafford Northcote was born in 184 G, and after leaving Eton proceeded Oxford, and subsequently entered the Foreign Office, afterwards acting as private secretary to Lord Salisbury at the Constantinople Embassy in 187 G-7. He sat until the present year as M.P. for Exeter, thus closing nineteen years\u2019 connection with the Western city. During that time he acted successively Financial Secretary to the War Office, Surveyor-General of Ordnance, and a Charity Commissioner. Sir Henry has taken a great interest in commercial and agricultural matters, and has been president of the United Chambers of Agriculture. Viscount Cromer and Lord Rowton, who become members of the Privy Council, are both widely known; the former for his great work Egypt, in recognition of which he was created a viscount year ago, having previously in 1892 been made baron; and the latter as a model private secretary to the Earl of Beaconsfield, and as the founder of the Rowton Houses,\u201d which have marked new era in well-directed and profitable philanthropy, having as its aim the assistance of the poor genteel. Lord Rowton became a peer 1880. The other new Privy Councillor, \\lr. W\u2019. W. Bramston Beach, M.P., is the Father o* the House of Commons, in which he has sat since 1857. Mr. W. T. Doxford, M.P., who receives a knighthood, is a well-known shipbuilder and marine engineer, and head of the firm of William Doxford and Sons (Limited), Sunderland. He was bom on February 1, 1841, and is the son of Mr. William Doxford, shipbuilder, of Grindon Hall,, Sunderland. Mr. Doxford was for some time Town Councillor for Sunderland. He is a J.P. for the Wearside l>orough, and a J.P. and D.L. for the county of Durham. He is also a metnljer of the British Corporation and of the River Wear Commission. 1895 Mr. Doxford did good work for the Unionist cause in Sunderland, having defeated a powerful candidate in Mr. Samuel Storey, who stood in the Liberal interest, along with Sir E. T. Gourley. Mr. Doxford was at the head of the poll with 9,8.\u201813 votes. Mr. Storey and Sir E. T. Gourley had represented Sunderland for many years. Mr. Doxford takes a quiet but active interest in all the public affairs of the borough he represents. Colonel Sir Howard Vincent, C. 8., M.P., who has acrepted the command of the infantry division of the City of London Imperial Volunteers, Colonel Commandant of the Queen\u2019s Westminster Volunteers. He was an ensign and lieutenant in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers from 1868 to 1873, and was made captain of the Royal Berkshire Militia in 1873, and Lieut.-Colonel of the Central London Rangers in 1875. He has represented Sheffield in Parliament as a Conservative since 1885. It will be remembered that since the outbreak of war Sir Howard Vincent has repeatedly offered to provide the Government with corps 1,000 selected marksmen Volunteers for service in South Africa, but the War Office could not see their way to accepting the proposals, although similar regiments are now lieing raised in all parts of the country- We printed in this column Saturday extract from the Saturday Review,\u201d which mentioned the fart that Lord Roberts has included on his staff Colonel Henderson, the Staff College Professor of Military History. Tliis officer was descrilied as \u201can eminent theorist,\u201d and a correspondent writes to to protest against this description of him inadequate. Colonel Henderson is, he asserts, a thoroughly sound regimental officer, as good at every practical detail of every-day soldiering as he at the highest branches of the profession of arms. After leaving Oxford he went Sandhurst; he joined the 81th (2nd York and Lancaster) in about 1*77, and he did so well in the campaign of 1882, both in lighting and brain work, that he was promised his brevet majority as soon as he obtained his company, and accordingly was gazetted major in the army the same day that he obtained his company. has held temporary appointments, both in the Ordnance and Army Service, and he has therefore had valuable experience of lx>th these departments. He had perfect grip of his men, who on their part worshipped him. Although for some years he has been doing nothing but staff work, he has kept in perfect touch, not only with regimental feeling, but with the minutiae regimental drill, etc. \u201cIn fact\u201d (adds our correspondent), \u201che is anything but a theorist. I should describe him, on the contrary, as an essentially practical soldier, with marvellously cultivated brain, and perfect knowledge of the capacities and deficiencies of our army.\u201d The century has been rich in soldiers of fortune; but it may be hoped that the British Government will prevent the Russian mercenary, General Gourko, who said to have left for Dei ago Bay with the intention of joining the Boers, from accomplishing his purpose. 1 ire German mercenary, Colonel Schiel, is now a prisoner in the hands of the British, and may hope that a like fate will befall General Gourko. Meanwhile it is interesting to note that the profession of soldiers fortune paying one. The Frenchman Perron, who commanded the Mahratta army, amassed a huge fortune; but he belonged to the iast century. Thejiineteenth century gallery of mercenaries\u2014a motley crowd, but including many men of lofty ideas, and possessing qualities which the world has admired \u2014embraces Lord Cochrane, Hobart Pasha, Count Ilinski, who fought for the Prince of Circassia, in the Hungarian Mar of Independence, and with the Turks as Iskander Bey; the famous Lnglishman, General Guyon, conspicuous in the Hungarian revolt; General Cluseret, Frenchman, with the unattractive renown of having fought against his own country; and Dombrowski, paid champion of Poland, and a servant of Garibaldi. Ricciotti Garibaldi may termed soldici fortune,\u201d for he has served France (in 1870) and Greece (in 181)7). The late Sir James Paget had reached the great age of 85, having been bora at Yarmouth in January, 1811. He pursued his studies at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and the first recognition the abilities of the man who has been termed the first surgical philosopher and orator of his day, was his appointment to catalogue and describe the pathological museums of St. Bartholomew\u2019s ami of the Royal College of Surgeons, a task which he carried out with much care and skill to lully juslily his selection. In 1817 he was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Surgery to the Royal College of Surgeons, and continued in that position for five years, the lectures which he delivered in this capacity on surgical pathology being considered masterly contributions to surgical science. Mr. Paget was made a Baronet in 1871, and received almost at the same time from the University of Edinburgh the honorary degree of i.L.D. He was made an hon. fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1813, and president of the same society in July, 1875. was a member of the Royal Commission appointed in 1881 to enquire into the condition of (he London hospitals for smallpox and fever rases and into the means of preventing the spread of infection. Sir James was one of the scientific celebrities who received honorary degree at the commemoration in 188'2 the 300th anniversary of the foundation of the University of Wurzburg.

{"ocr": "Politics and Society. The Vacancy in York, Both political parlies meet to-night, tho Liberal Executive to decide upon a course of action, and, if thought wise, to select a candi- date, and the Unionists to adopt Mr Geo Deni- son Faber to champion their cause in the cam- paign. Much surprise will be expressed if the candidate of the Liberal party is not Sir Chris- topher Furness, though information is not abso- lutely certain iipon the point. Sir Ohris toplier has lost no friends in the city since the last election, when, after a plucky fight, lie was beaten but b yeleven votes, whilst th state of the party register is practically unaltered. What- ever may be the decision of the Liberal party this evening, Sir Christopher is not likely to be present in the city, it being understood that business engagements occupy him in th North until Wednesday, after which he will proceed to town.

The elevation of Sir John Lubbock to the peerage was not expected, and no candidate for London University has yet been selected by either political party. It is not known whether there will bo a contest or not. The University was represented by Mr Robert Lowo as a Liberal from 1868 until his elevation to tho peerage as Viscount Sherbrooke in 1880. Sir John Lub- bock succeeded him with the Opposition, and lias represented the University ever unco, first as a Liberal, and since 1836 as a Liberal Unionist. He has only been once opposed \u2014 in 1B&6. ?? Mr Frederic Harrison stood as a Gladstonian, but obtained only 516 votes, against 1.341 ghen to Sir John Lubbock. The Attack on the Secretary for War. Lord Lans down.) h etill tlie butt of attacks made upon these respoi\u2014 ible for the present position of the army in South Africa. There is a growing feeling in some eras triers that he shall go. and now it is reported that tho relations be- twoai the civil and tho military chiefs of the War Department aro seriously strained. Lord Wolseley, it is whispered, has already threat- ened to resign and to show up the whole affair. The Imperial Defence Committee, 6ays a third gossip, is ail at sixes and sevens, knowing noth- ing of the weighty matters which it has in band. How much truth there is in any of _ leso stories it is difficult to tell, but two facts stand cut conspicuously; first, that Lord Lansdowne's P'\u00abition becomes more and moro i\u2014secure; and second, that if the Ministry goes to piecc3 it will be either in po r_ cquer.ee o fiuternal weak- ness, or as il\u00abe result of a hostile agitation in- geniously and ?? directed against it Ly thoeo cf its own household. Lord Wolseley Threatens Revelations The \" Man cliester Guardian's\" London corre- spondent says that if Lord Wolseley is assail cd in any public fasl lion ho will deliberately reveal the actual position he has taken in connection with our military armament?. He asserts that he has lreen overruled from the first, and, what is more, that lus advice has been abso- lutely neglected. As a fact, Lord Wolseley if \u2014 and for this I have aljso- luto justification \u2014 more in harmony with tiie position adopted by .Sir William Butler than any man at tho War Office. It w~,is he, indeed, who insisted on Sir William receiving his present pocd tion at Devonport. I hear that Sir William has, contrary to tho desire of his friends, resolved not to publish any justification of his conduct or to give to the world tho incidents that led to lus return from South Africa. Tho attitude of the War Office \u2014 a friendly one\u2014 has node it le_ . neces- sary io take action. Chairman of the Congregational Union. Mr John Carvcll Willi-\u2014 ts, M.P., has entered upon his dutie-s as Chairman of the Congrega tional Union of England and Wales, in sucoee- sion to the Rev. H. Arnold Then\u2014 \u2014 , M.A.. of Br_>toL Mr Williams was born in IS2I. When his education was finis! ted, he was for eoine time with a firm of proctors in Doctors Comi none and there gained a knowledge of ceeiotfiasticai matters which proved of service in his future career. It waa the opposition of the Nonconformists to Sir Jamos Graham's Factories Education Bill that first brought Mr Willi ams into notice. In 1847, when but twenty six years of age. he was appointed Secretary to the \" British Anti-State Church Association,\" a name changed later to that of tbe \" Society for the Liberation of Religion from State Patronage and Control,\" popularly known as '\"The Liberation Society.\" His services in succession as secretary, chair\u2014 ii in of the Parliamentary Committee, and deputy- chairman of tho Executive Committee of the society represent tho strenuous activities of the be.et years of a lifetir.'o, Tn tlie movement for religious equality Mr Williams and tho late Mr E. Miall_ were able coadjutor-;. Mr Williams's contributions to controversial literature are large, and include pamphlets on religious equality, education, tiie burials question, and various poli- tical questions. For tiie past sevon years he has satin Parliament for the Mans field Division of Notts. A Day of Prayer and Fasting. The following notice appears in tlie new num- ber of tho ''York Diocesan Magazine\" : \u2014 \"The Archbishop is very desirous that a day of prayer and fasting should be observed in tho Diocese of York, in connection with the present war, and has only delayed to make this announce- ment, hoping that a day might bo appointed for tho whole nation, or at all events for the Church of England. This may still possibly bo arranged ; but should it not be so, the Archbishop will fix an early date for tho purpose. The Bishop of Durham has also issued a pjm _ a r notice. A King Goes A- Wooing. King Alexander of Servia, who was the guest of the Emperor Francis Joseph during two \"days last week, is seeking tlie hand of tho Princes- Elizabeth, daughter of the late Crown Prince Rudolf and tbe Princess Stophanie. King Alexander is only 24 years of ago-; tlie Prim-ess Elizabeth 16. Invalids, Tbe Marquess of Lothian ie reported to be in a critical state.

Half-Timers and Shop Assistants. Several new Acts came into operation with the new year. Th at of Mr Robson, which practically abol\u2014 hes the ha lf-tinior, is now the law of the land. So is tho Bdl compelling the provision of seats in shops for assistants. There have been several email exhibitions of seats in London, at which the various inventions for compying with the Aofc without l'miting the space behind tlie counter have been shown. The man feature of these devices appears to be tL\u2014 they present sea_. on which it is impossible to imagine any human being stting in conifer fc ; In the prin- cipal shopa of London the Act is very likely to be a dead-letter, for while the proprietors will provide the seats Ln accordance with the Act, there is no guarantee that these will bo seats on which anybody can sit, and there is nothing to prevent a proprietor of a shop informing his assistants that anyone among them who makes use of tbe seat during shop hours will be dis- missed.

{"ocr": "GERMAN TRIBUTE TO TOMMY ATKINS. As I am reliably informed, says the Berlin correspondent of the \"Daily Telegraph,\" one of the chief and ablest of the Generals of the German Army remarked the other day, when talking over the British reverses in South Africa : \"We should not have fared better in similar conditions.\" The purport of these words must not be misunderstood either at home or by our critics in this country. The gallant General, whose name I need not men- tion, did not criticise either one way or the other, but admfifcted certain grave mistakes that have been made. What he meant was to lay stress on the magnificent bravery of our trooops, which is universally acknowledged amongst leading military men here. Pitted against marksmen like the Boers, fighting as they do, he did not think any troops could have effected more. The Germans knew that the Boers were excellently armed and well prepared and that they would fight obstin- ately, but they did not anticipate before the war began that they would prove quite as strong as they have shown themselves to be.

The undermentioned troop 3 will embark in the transport America at Woolwich on Wed- nesday, for conveyance to the Cape : \u2014 Am- munition Column, Sixth Division, five offi- cers, 130 non-commissioned officers and men, and 93 horses ; Mounted Infantry, Sixth Divi- sion, Ist Royal Irish Regiment, four officers, 136 non-commissioned officers and men, and 183 horses ; detachments of the 3rd Divisional Field Hospital and other details, making a total of 11 officers, 269 rank and file, and 276 horses. A Board of Officers from Woolwich Garrison made an official inspection yesterday of the Assaye at Woolwich, prior to the em- barkation of troops. Our Aldershot correspondent states that the colours of the 2nd Hampshire Regiment were yesterday morning sent to Winchester to be kept in safe custody by the Mayor. The colours of the 2nd Norfolk Regiment were also paraded with the battalion for the last time preparatory to being sent to Norwich. The Norfolk, Hampshire, Lincolnshire, and Scot- tish Borderers Battalion embark on the 4th, the Cheshires on the 7th, the East Lancashires and South Wales Borderers on the 10th, and the North Staffords on the 11th. The 83rd, 84th, and 85th Batteries embark on the Bth. Four companies of Mounted Infantry \u2014 the Gloucesters, Buffs, Oxfords, and West Rid- ings\u2014leave Aldershot this week. They take their horses with them, but the battalions of the Seventh Division will be provided with mounts on their arrival at the Cape. The Reservists of the five Hussar regiments at the front, to the number of about 500, are to come to Aldershot for training and equipment. THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY. PRINCE OF WALES'S INTEREST. THE ALLEGED ENLISTMENT OF BOER SPIES. The committee of the Imperial Yeomanry movement issued last evening the following notification :\u2014 \" A letter was received by the secretary on Monday morning from Sir Digh- ton Probyn saying that H.R.H. the Prince of Wales was taking the keenest interest .in the raising of the Imperial Yeomanry force for ser- vice in South Africa. H.R.H. also asked for information as to the probable date of the departure of the first detachment, as he was most anxious to personally inspect at least some part of the force.\" \" The offices have again been thronged all day with visitors. Everything is progressing most satisfactorily.\" \"The Re-mount Department is rety busy, and is progressing satisfactorily.\" As the result of inquiries we are in a posi- tion to say that persons suspected of being Dr. Leyds's emissaries have applied to join the Imperial Yeomanry, presumably with the object of learning all they could about Ha strength, equipment, and plans. A couple of supposed Boer spies were actually enrolled, or about to be enrolled, when their bona- fides came into question, and investigation led to the cutting short of their Yeomanry career. There is a strong suspicion that the enter- prising Dr. Leyds is at the bottom of the little plot. It is admitted that suspicious circumstances havo led to the exercise of great care, and all the officials connected in any way with the enrolment will keep a sharp look-out for any candidates who may appear to be actuated by ulterior motives. The central authority is not yet in a position to give the total number of enrolments at the different centres, or the aggregate of them all, but they are quite satisfied that good progress is being made. Sir George Arthur, formerly of the Life Guards, is doing good service to the committee at the Home Centre in the way of receiving and interrogating candidates, and passing them on to the proper quarters. Each man is closely questioned as to his record, health, character, and ability to ride and shoot well. Their replies are not taken on trust, but an actual test of their capabilities is arranged for. They are directed to their respective headquarters for riding and shooting tests, and it is understood that these will be most vigorous. It has been decided with the approval of the General Officer Commanding the Scottish Dis- trict that all Scotch candidates for the Im- perial Yeomanry, who are not already mem- bers of a Scotch Yeomanry Regiment, must first enlist in the Yeomanry, which they may do for one year. They are at liberty to enlist in any regiment they may prefer, the regi- ments being as follow : \u2014 Ayrshire, Lanark.-*, Lothians and Berwickshire, Lanarkshire (Glasgow), and the Fifeshire Light Horse Vol- unteers, which for present purposes is re- garded as a Yeomanry regiment. All persons resident in England and who are desirous of being enrolled in the Scottish contingent should apply to Colonel Sir William Baillie Hamilton, ?? C.8., 1, Castle Terrace, Edinburgh. The fund inaugurated at a county meeting at Dorchester yesterday for the equipment of Yeomanry and Volunteers reached the sum of \u00a35,000. It included contributions of \u00a31,000 each from Lords Wim borne and Ilchester. Nearly forty troopers of the Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry have signified their willing- ness to serve in the field. Promises representing a sum of about \u00a33,000 were made at a county meeting at Win- chester yesterday for the equipment of Volun- teers and Yeomanry. The first list of subscriptions to a fund started in Windsor for the Berkshire Yeo- manry and Volunteers amounts to \u00a3354. A Berwickshire fund now stands at \u00a31,500. The Northumberland and Durham funds for the equipment of a contingent of Imperial Yeomanry, which now amount to \u00a341,000, will be amalgamated. BOER MILITARY MISSION TO EUROPE. (Thringli Reuters Agency.) AMSTERDAM, Monday Commandant De Waard, of the Hollander Corps of Pretoria, has arrived in Holland. He has been entrusted by the Transvaal Govern- ment with a mission to Europe. It is believed that he has come to Europe to make purchases in Holland and Germany. He stated that the Boers had an abundan supply of ammunition. WOUNDED FROM DURBAN. (Through Reuters Agenev.) \u201e CAPE TOWN^ Sunday. The Roslin Castle has arrived, with 170 wounded from Durban. |AT THE WAR OFFICE. AN ABSENCE OF NEWS. With the exception of two short telegrams issued in the afternoon (one recording casual- ties already reported in Press telegrams, and the other adding nothing of importance to news from the front) not a single item of news was communicated by the War Office yester- day. At 7 o'clock last evening it was officially stated that there was no news of the reported British occupation of Colesberg. At 9 o'clock there was an intimation that no more news had come to hand, and at 11-30 it was stated that no further news would be issued. Mr. Balfour called during the evening. AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS. (Through Reuters Agency.) CAPE TOWN, Monday It is understood that an exchange of pris oners is under consideration. Irregular Corps are being formed in various parts of the Colony, and enrolment is progress- ing rapidly. The steamship Fremona has arrived with a thousand mules from Naples. IRISH AMERICAN VOLUNTEERS TO ASSIST THE BOERS. (Through Reuters Agency.) NEW YORK, Monday The \"Tribune\" states that there ia an under- standing between the South African Republic and the Irish physical force party for the de- spatch of members of Irish Volunteers to assist the Boers. The order may, adds the journal, send out Volunteers organised in 1895 under the Clan Na Gael in New York and other large cities, and which were estimated to number 22,000 men. NOTES ON THE SITUATION. (By a Military Correspondent.) LONDON, Monday Night The report that General French has occu- pied Colesberg, which, however, still lacks \u2022 official confirmation, goes to confirm the con- tention which I have already expressed in these notes that our column operating in that district is by far the most mobile, and conse- quently the most useful, one Of our army in South Africa. That the Boers offered very little opposition counts for nothing, for it is clear that an important point like Colesberg would not be abandoned by the enemy unless they anticipated being out-manceuvred by % superior force. Times out of number General French has utilised his cavalry, monnted in- fantry, and light artillery to the best advan- tage, and by these continuous and rapid move- ments he has apparently convinced tbe Boers that he commands a very much larger body of men than is actually the case. Unlike the other positions, where Generals I Clery, Gatacrej and Methuen have been un- [ able to prevent the enemy taking suitable cover, General French has kept the Free Staters on the move to au<-h an extent that they have not had time to make suitable pre- parations for a strong defence. Colesberg is on the high road to Bloemfontein, and its oc- j ' cupation will materially assist General Gat- i * acre when the time comes for him to join hands I with General French. In striking contrast to the somewhat pesaim- < ?? \u2014 I m istic views expressed in Mr Winston < iiur. h. ill's interesting message last week e*\u00bbmmm a very hopeful telegram from Mr li. nu\u00abu Bur- leigh, whose experien.-e as a war ?? -ent in all purls of the world entitles kiss Ua judge with accuracy th,' relative fmmtluma 4 the opposing armies aud their . han. e\u00bb of success.

Under Secretary for Ireland, be appointed a member of the Privy Council in Ireland. Sir H. Stafford Nohthcote sat for a number of years as a Conservative member of the House of Commons, but recently resigned his seat on being appointed Governor of Bombay. He is tbe second son of the late Earl of Iddesleigh, better known in the country as Sir Stafford Northcote, the intimate political associate of Lord Beaconsfield. The new Governor of Bombay was educated at Eton and at Merton College, Oxford. He was appointed to a Clerkship in the Foreign Office in 1868, holding tbe appointment until 1871, when_he proceeded to Washington as an Attache of Earl Grey's Special Mission to arrange the Treaty of Washington. In 1873 he married Alice, the adopted daughter of Lord Mount-Stephen, of Montreal. He was Private Secretary to the Marquess of Salisbury's Special Embassy to Constantinople, and in 1876 received the appointment of Acting Third Sec- retary in the Diplomatic Service. From 1877 to 1880 he was Private Secretary to his father, who in that period filled the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer in Lord Beaconsfield's Government. He was appointed Financial Secretary to the War Office in 1885, and Surveyor General of Ordnance in 1886. In 1887 he was created a Baronet, on the abolition of his last-named office. He continued to render his Party unfailing service, and accepted the unpaid position of a Charity Commissioner in 18S2. Sir Stafford represented Exeter from 1880 until his resignation of the seat. Sir John Lubbock's position and services are well- known in literary, scientific, and political circles throughout the country. Born in 1834, he is the eldest son of the late Sir William John Lubbock, who was Vice President of the Royal Society and a scientific author of distinction. Sir John in 1856 married Ellen Frances, only daughter of the Rev. Peter Hordern, a Lancashire clergyman. That lady died in 1879, and some five years later he married Alice, daughter of General and the Hon. Mrs. Fox-Pitt-Rivers. Sir John, besides being head of one of the - chief banking establishments in the City, is Chairman of the London Bankers and also Chairman of the Central Association of Bankers. He was Vice Chancellor of the Univer- sity of London from 1874 to 1880, when he resigned the position in order that he might represent it in Parlia- ment. Local as well as educational and Imperial affairs claim a large share of his attention. He has been Doth Chairman and Vice Chairman of the London County Council, of which body he is an Alderman ; he is a Justice of the Peace for Kent, and, among nume- rous other offices, is a Trustee of the British Museum. In the scientific world he also holds offices of distinc- tion, being President of the Linnsean Society and a Fellow of the Royal Society and other learned bodies. He is known as the author of \"Prehistoric Times,\" \"The Origin of Civilisa- tion and the Primitive Conditions of Man,'' and many other works of a scientific character, and which are to be found in every public library of the country ; his \" Ants, Wasps, and Bees \" is among the most widely read books. Sir John was returned to Parliament for Maidstone from 1870 to April, 1880, when his candidature was unsuccessful. He was, however, returned by the London University in June of that year, and he has continued to represent it ever since. He was a Liberal, and supporter of Mr. Glad- stone until that Statesman brought forward his Home Rule proposals, when, with Lord James of Hereford and other prominent members of the Party, he became a Liberal Unionist. The elevation of Sir John to the Peerage causes a vacancy in the representation of London University. Viscount Cromer and Baron Cromer, of Cromer, Norfolk, has performed distinguished services in Egypt, which are fresh in the public mind. He was formerly a Major in the Royal Artillery, when he was Sir Evelyn Baring, and his name became familiar in the Seventies, while lie was in Egypt. He was a Commissioner of the Egyptian Public Debt from 1877 to 1879, after which he became Comptroller General. He is now her Majesty's Agent and Consul General in Egypt, and a i Minister Plenipotentiary in the Diplomatic Service since 1883. He was born in 1841, and in 1876 he mar- ried Ethel, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Rowland Stanley Errington. The Viscount was elevated to the Peerage in 1892, and advanced to a Viscountcy in January, 1899. Lord Rowton, of Rowton Castle, Salop, is best known in association with the late Lord Beaconsfield, to whom he acted as private secretary from 1866 to 1868, and again from 1874 to 1880. He is the second son of the Right Hon. Henry Corry, M.P., who was for some time First Lord of the Admiralty. During 1878 he was Secretary to the Special Embassy to the Berlin Congress. Lord Rowton is closely associated with the model lodging houses in London which bear his name. Mr. Wiixiam Wither Bramston Beach represents the Andovor Division of Hants, and has been a Mem- ber of Parliament since 1857. On the death of Sir John Mowbray he became Father of the House of Commons, where he is a close attendant, taking a steady but unobtrusive part in the work of the House, and giving the Conservative Party, in whose interest he has been uninterruptedly returned, regular and useful support. He is the only son of Mr. William Beach, of Oakley Hall, Hants, and Keevil House, Wilts, and was born in 1826. In April, 1857, the year in which he became a member of Parliament, he married Caroline, youngest daughter of the late Colonel Augustus Cleveland, of Tapeley Park, North Devon. Mr. William Theodore Doxford is a son of Mr. William Doxford, a shipbuilder. He was born in 1841, and is a shipbuilder and engineer of the firm of Dox- ford and Sons (Limited), of Sunderland. Mr. Doxford, Who is a Justice of the Peace of the town and a Deputy Lieutenant and Magistrate for Durham, entered Par- liament in 1895, when he stood as Conservative candi- date for Sunderland, defeating Mr. Samuel Storey, Liberal, who had represented the borough for many years. Mr. Walter Thorburn is a Liberal, though opposed to Home Rule, and sits for the Selkirk and Peebles Division. He is a son of Mr. Walter Thorburn, banker, of Peebles, where he was born in 1842. He was edu- cated at the Grammar School, Musselburgh, and in 1871 married Elizabeth Jackson, eldest daughter of the late David Scott, of Meadowfield, Edinburgh.

A few years later he was employed in the Con- sulate at Panama, and from 1858 onward he has held various Consular appointments in different parts of the world. He was created a C.M.G. in 1894, and re- ceived the Jubilee Medal in 1897. Mr. Geo. Dalhousie Ramsay was a prominent offi- cial at the War Office, but retired from that Depart- ment in 1892.

The central portion of the footbridge at Windsor Weir suddenly collapsed on Saturday, owing to the failure of some of the supporting woodwork. The displacement of the paddles allowed the stream to flow freely through the openings, slightly lowering the river at Windsor Bridge, where yesterday it was below its Summer level. No inconvenience has any- where resulted from the mishap, which can easily be repaired. ", "word": "3057", "description": "... (Limited), of Sunderland.

{"ocr": "THE 'WAR. GENERAL FRENCH'S ADVANCE. IMPORTANT SUCCESS ENEMY O1TLTN(E1JYRED. SURPRISED BY THE CAVALRY COLESBERG OCCUPIED. BOERS IN FULL FLIGHT. SPECIAL TELEGRAMS. One item of welcome news, if no more, is contained in this morning's batob of tcle- grams. General French, while eyes have been straining towards the Modder and the Tugela, has \"pressed the yielding minute,\" routed the Boers to the north of Arundel, and occupied Colesberg. It was on Friday night that the enemy offered General French the advantage at the far end of which be saw success. At that time, as our Correspondent tells us, finding their cemmuni- catiows seriously threatened by our cavalry, they fell back from their entrenched position at Rensburg. Part of our force kept them eon- stantly in touch, harassing them, and hamper- iug their retirement. Then on Sunday night cavalry and artillery, with the infantry in waggons, were sent out. to turn the Boers' right flank. At dawn yesterday the pursuing force I made a feigned attack on the enemy's front. They were already engaged when the column sent out to the west found themselves within striking distance, and came into action. The Boers, fronted by our field guns, and with a mobile force of cavalry *ad light artillery on their right, broke and fled in disorder, learing Colesberg in our possession. General French is now within twelve miles of the Orange River. The old waggon route to the Free State passes through Colesborg, and crosses the river by a fine bridge 1,340ft. long. This route will be found marked by a dotted line on the accompanying map. More to the east is the railway bridge at Norvad's Pont. One or both of these bridges must have been used by the Boers. Will General French be able to taake a sudden descent on them beforz they are blown up by the enemy, and secure the passage of the river ? We are told that the Boers have gone east. This may mean that they have retreated to NorvaL's Pontor toVenterstad, which is twenty- nine miles further east. Philipstown, the only place to the west of General French s position at Colesberg, is, it is satisfactory to learn, free of Boers. No confirmation of General French's success was forthcoming from the War Office last night. At 11.30 p.m. it was stated that no further news would be issued till to-day. GENERAL FRENCH. General French.. as will be remembered, began the present Impugn in Natal, and on being sum- moned to the Cape got out of Ladysmnith by a train sent soith just before the final inrestment of the town .t was he who was in command at Elandslaagte, General White, who was on the field, leaving the direction of the battle, as he stated in dispatche, entirely in his hands. General French served in ther Nil, Expedition of 1834-85, and was present at Abu Kims.. and at Metammeb, being mentioned in dispatche&. Another incident which emphasises almost equally.-the value of mounted men is reported from Dordrecht, eastward of Sterkstroom. On Saturday Capt. Montmorency, with 120 troopers, some miles to the north fell in with a force of the Boers, before whom they had to fall back on the town. Lieut. Milford I Turner and 27 men seemed to have been cut I off, and failed to get back into camp. On Sun- day morning Captain Goldsworthy and about 200 mounted men, with.several guns, went out E to their relief. In this they were completely successful, the Boers being beaten back, with loss, and the missing Lieutenant and his squadron brought in. Dordrecht will, however, not be allowed to remain in our hands without trouble. A telc- gram direct from the town on Sunday after- noon states that 2,000 Boers are advancing south, our patrols have been drivon in, and I fighting is imminent. The British force has taken up a strong position outside the town prepared to resist the attack. Both at Modder River and in Natal the Boera seem to have been engaged in modifying their line of defence. Waggons have been seen by General Buller's sccuts moving in the direction of Springfield, OiL the Upper Tugela, and it has been ascertained tha the enemy have esta- blished a camp there. So at the Modder we are told that the enemy appeared to have moved much of their strength ftom their left, and they are reported to have formed a new laager fifteen miles down the river at F-amed Hook. They maintaia a desul- tory gun-firo on our position. A strong reeon- noitring party under General Babington went out eastward yesterday morning, with what result is so far unknown. We noticed yesterday the cutting of the rail- way near Victoria West. Our Capetown Corre- spondent now telegraphs that the whole districtl is seehing with sedition, the Dutch farmers being fully arueli and ansions to act it favour of the enemy. We have so far received nothing confirming or otherwise the Boer accounts of serious fight.- ing at Mafeking, published by us yesterday. A telegram from Lord Methuen's camp, of 3 Tuesday's date, states that during the morn- I ing heavy firing had been heard in the direction of Kimberley. On Page 6 of our impression this Morning will be fotmd letts from asavea ofl our -oor- respondents at tho soat of wr. One, describ- ing the long-sighted preparations at Kimberley for the defence of the town, shows that feeling is very strong there against the Cape Govern- ment, which refused to supply guns and am- munition, and until the last denied that there was any danger threatening. The writer, who left only a few hours before the investment. by the Boers was complete, declares that, in his opinion, the defences there are absolutely im- pregnable. Our special correspondent with the Australian Contingent sends an interesting ao- count of the men and their doings. They are intent, he says, on showing the old country and her foes that they are men fit to stand in the shoes of their fathers. (FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.) ARUNDEL, Saturday, Dec. 30. The Boers have suddenly evacuated their en- tronchod position at Rensburg, and are retiring to Colesberg, evidently fearing for their com- munications, which are threatened by our cavalry and horse artillery. Our cavalry hold positions within three miles of Colesberr. RENSBURG, Jan. 1. General French has completely defeated the Boers, and occupied Colesberg. Later. General French continues to keep the enemy on the movo. He pressed them closely on Saturday and Sunday, giving them no time to make a prolonged stand. Last night all our cavalry, artillery, and infantry, the latter riding in waggou to in- crease the general mobility of the advance, started upon a night march with the object of turning the eneray's right flank. 'Tho operations were brilliantly successful. When day broke we were within striking dis- tance of the enemy. Our infantry and field batteries at once made a feint attack upon the -four front, and while this was proceeding our cavalry and light artillery got right round the enemy's right flank, as arranged. The programme worked without a hitch. The Boers were utterly surprised, and, find- ing their retreat tbrestoced, they fled in dis- order to the eastward, leaving Colesberg in our ?? News. NAAUAPOORT, Dec. 30. The Boers during last night abandoned their positions north of Arundel, and fell back to Colesberg. The movement was quickly followed up by General French. At daybreak to-day a strong force of cavalry and horse artillery followed the track of the Boers, and came up with them a little this side of Colesberg. Their position there was shelled effectively for some time. They made no reply to our fire and are clearly demoralised by our unexpected movement. They suffered considerably from the artillery 1 fire. The enemy are undoubtedly considerably dis- turbed by the tactics of- General French, who c gives them no ?? News. 9.30 p.M. British troops are now camped six miles south of Colesberg. Th2e Boers are supposed to be 1 6till retreating. Our scouts ha\"e been fired upon, and Lieute- nant Hedger, attached to the 10th Hussars, is reported to have been made a prisoner. The Boers destroyed the railway whilst re- treating to within a few miles south of Coles- berg. The British are now repairing the damage. -Dalziel. ORANGE RIVER, Dec. 30.

The following particulars have been received here of the fighting at Labuseb\"goh Nek y-e terday and to-day: A hundred men of Flannigan's Squadron of Brabant's Horse yesterday had the first coitoct with the enemy, who were about equal in num- ber, but were subsequently reinforced by 600 men, with two guns. Flannigan's men thereupon retired. Lient. Milford Turner and 27 men were left behind ini a donga. This morning, Captain Goldaworthy, with 110 men ad four guns, Captain Montmo- rency's scout6 accompanying, left Dordrecht to relieve Lieutenant Turner's party. Tho enemy were engaged, and beaten back with some loss. Eight Doers are known to have been killed, besides 13 horses. Our casu- alties wore slight. The dotachment remain- ing in the donga were relievod. Our men, b7 a series of movements, outmanoeuvred the Booer. It is believed that our success will have a far-reaching effect in arresting the progress of recruiting for the enemy.-Reuter. STETKSTRIOOM, Dec. 30. A patrol, under Captain Montmorenry, num- bering 120 men, left Dordrecht this morning to reconnoitre the position, and ascertained the strength of the Boers lying to the north. They were Eighted abcut midday. The ernemy were occupying a good position upon a precipitous ridge about three miles outside the town. A detachment was sent to work around the Boers' flank, while the rest sought cover in a donga. In front the Boers nullified the latter movement by occupying another ridge which overlooked the donga. They poured a hot fire into the dongm, but did no harm. Meanwhile the detachment sent to outflan the enemy had worked round to the rear, and thcy drove the Boers back from their position. At this moment a strong body of Boers arrived to re-inforce the Boers, who were compelled to fall back. A party of the Cape Mounted Police, num- bering about a hundred, arrivod soon after, but directly they appeared on the field a shell from a big gun which the Boers had brought up fell near to the town. It was clear that the enemy numbered qui-o fifteen hundred, and had artil- lery. The whole force therefore retired, keeping good order. The Boers kept up a persistent fire at long range during the retirement, but our casualties are very slight, if, indeed, anyone was hit. Thq enemy had several killed and wounded. The whole force !.as new taken up a good defensive position outside the town, in readi- ness to rewist the Boers' attack. Dec. 31. Captain de Montmorency's brush with the Boers yesterday, when a squadron of 120 Colonial Mounted Infrntry, afterwards rein- forced by a sizlilar number, effectually checked the Oadvance of an immensely superior force of Boers, notwithstanding the fact they had with them big guns, shows the effectiveness of mounted men in the present campaign. Captain Meontmorenev led his men with characteristic dash. By frequent demonstrations towards both of the enemy's flanks ho kept the Boers in a continued state of perplexity. During the retirement of the little force, one party was cut off from the main body. They did not return on Saturday, ald at daybreak to-day Captain Goldsworthy, with four guns, went out to bring them in. The expedition was successful, nearly every man being relieved and brought back. Captain Goldsworthy had a sharp brush with the Boers, in which he lost four men wounded. The Beers bad eight killed.-Central. News. CAPE COLONY. SEDITION AT VICTORIA LWEST- DUTCH READY TO RISE. (FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.) CAPETOWN, Saturday, Dec. 30, 5.15 p.m. 'Ugly rumours are afloat regarding the dis- nffected Colonial Dutch. The Victoria West district is said to be seething with sedition, while every Dutchman in the ClanwiUiam dis- trict is reported to be armed with Mausers, and ready and anxious to use them on behalf of the Republics. These and other treasonable symptoms em- phasise the necessity and wisdom of retaining a large force to guard the lines of communica- tion, which require as much watching almost as if they ran through an enemy's country. (FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.) TAFELBERG, Saturday, Dec. 30. The district of Middelburg seems all quiet, and the whole extent of the rebellion appears to have been reached. Doubtless sympathy runs against the British, but the jpossibility of confiscation proves a sufhcieut deterrent to open disloyalty. I The enemy is kept fully informed of every movement on our part, but odly by further successful invasion does he seem likely to gain much uccession of strength frota Cape Colony. I p/opose viewing General Gatacro's position - reporting thereon before returning north- wards, where the advance is likely still to sutffer some delay. CAPFTOWN, Deo. 31.

YFSTERDAY AT MODDE R, ENEM1Y MOVING DOWN THE RIVER. STRONG CAVALRY RECONNAIS- SANCE. (WROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) CAPrOWN, Saturday, Dec. 30, 5.15 p.m. The Boer position at Magersfontein seems impregnable. First they have steep kopjes at the foot of which is a fringe of bush, partially. concealing a long deep trench, the excavated earth forming a brestwork. The Boers have hollowed out the rear of their trenches intn bomb-proof caves. In front of the trenches is a barbed wire fence. Then come a hundred and fifty yards of stony ground, and then ancther barbed wire fence. (CENThAL WZWS AGOWT.) MODDER RIVER CAMP, Jan. 1, NoonL It is reported that the Boers have formed a i now laager at Klameel Hoek, fifteen miles down the Modder River.

One sl- low does not wake a summer. The success is a small, thoughoam important one. But it comas as t cbsering hainger of the New Year; ae- cording to the GermnE~mperor and the Engliak Church Prayer Book, of the New Century also. It comes, in the first place, at a moment whe% a fit of depression as to the conduct of our forces in the fiekl has taken hold of the country, jiiot unnattrally after the week of disaster fol- lowed by a long pause in operations. For the first time, in the whole campaign the enemy has been defeated, not by a frontal attack or a night surprise, but ,by being imposed on in front and attacked in rear. Steadily through. out his little campaign General French has, as I hare repeauedly pointed out, asserted the superiority oiatvalry and borse artillery backed by mounted infantry, over the pure mounted infantry of-the Boers. Nowr he has improved upon that..performance by doing what-rwe hav beard *t'nowbero else, adopting one of the or- dinarysteps of war, but one not much practised . peite. Hie has pushed forward his infantry in carts to give support to his cavalry, hi artaler,, and his Colonial mounted in- fantry. - He has followed up his enemy throughout, as far as one can fromn thebrief reports, as the French put it, .Vpde dans les reins,\" with the sword at their backs all.the time, the only way to make their retreat disastrous. It has been, so far as one ca seet a thoroughly well managed business If not % ho can follow on and, either swin round, to his right can catch the Stormber, Bloero, who appear to be eommitted to the at- tack on Dordrecht, in revesl whilst they ate attacxed by Sir W. Gatacre on the Southem and -Eastern side, or, if he is unable to corn. n'anioste sufficiontly well with Sir W. Gatacre i6r them to combine their movements, can, a the panic which must have followed his unez- pected success, seize the FAstern bridges over the Oage River at Norval's Pont and Sethulie Bridge, it may Save a decisive influence on the rebellion in the Capc Colony. That rebellion, an is explained by \" U,- Daily News,\" Corre- spondent at Capetown, is Aching throughout Victoria West and the (lan ?? District. Everywhere, nevertheless, the solid part of the population are afraid to join in it, ,ad, as wa described in the letter published ou Friday, sent from the seat of war by a corresiondent to \"Paterfanilias,\" are looked upon as ?? by the Transvaal and Free State Beers, because that is so. A crushing def.a\\& of the invaders by the combined forces Jf General French and Sir W. Gatacre, such as their relative positions seem now to pro would probably decide these wavering mind One of the most serious dangers of tue whole situation would then be eliminated. Even if General French is unable to move quickly enough to co-operate with Sir W. Gatacre m dealing with the Boers now moving on Dor. drecht, I cannot but look upon it as good news that they are making that attempt. Sin1e Colonel or Major or Captain Dalgetty or Del- gety-all these names are assigned to the police officer who captured the place, and I must leave them to my reader' I choice, for I do not know-bU in -he captured Dordrecht complete coming- nication has been established between it and Sir W. Gatacre. We know that Sir W. Gat-. has been reinforced, and the Boers, in presboee of so active and, pace Lord Durham, so val*-t able an officer as Sir W. Gatacre, are more than likely to find themselves in the wrong box if they attempt to recover Dordrecht, the loss ef which has evidently been a great annoyance to them. Altogether, things loo\" brighter us that part of the theatre of war than they hard done since the war began. At Mafelking Colonel Baden-PoWell has beas making some vigorous attack on the Boer lines of which wre have as yet only heard the Bow version, which from former experiences is likely to be rather different from his own. By the way, I hope that none of my readers, who de more than casually glance at these notes, wil misunderstand my statement previously made, and now repeated. that till this ?? General French's no one had manmuvred an enemy out of a position, as anly disparagement to eithm- Colonel Baden-Powell, Colonel Kekewitch, or Sir A. Hunter. In what they have each done I can detect nothing but most excellent and admiraible work. Colonel Baden-Powell has been simply magnificent throughout, but A General encloeed within a defended town has n. opportunity for free mnceurring. he may surpise an enemy, and may use all the innumer. able devices that Colonel Baden-Powell has se well applied, to get the better of him, but, 'A the enemy maintains a tolerably connected front all round him, he has no chance to earry out such an operation as that which General French has just done. Even that is hardly what ne, generally means by maneuvnng an enemy out of a position. A stroke en Bloem. fonteiin, for instance, obliging the Boers to abandon their lines round haimnberley, would be a much better illustration. So far as I Cam see, the Boers having no facilities for man- asuvring in the open field, anything that draw. them out into that is in our favour, anything that encourages them to remain and fortify their strong position, in the confidence that there only shall we attack them, is in theirs. I hope every one wdil read the Australian Correspondent's letter published to-day from Orange River and Belmont. It is fall of hearty feeling and humour. The following de. acription of the Beers he has met with will give a taste of its quality: It is useliss to argue with a old Boer. One might as woll try and expound Euclid to a eyed cameL Both would listen to you, but neither would profit by your labour.

I know the ole We ha o something very similar amongs the old German settlers in the bacibseks of Aus- tral An emu is more amenable to reason -than they are, and no man ever lived who could knock sense into an emU. To anyone who knows the true back-country Boer that is an admirable touch. A story which I heard a short time ago from the man to whom it happened wil illus- trate the rough type. A missionary was visit- in; a Boer family, and found that they were daily using, and therefore wearing out, a Bible that had been brought over with the family three centuries or so before from lol- land, and containing all the family names trom father to son ever since. He pointed out to them that it wus a treasure not so to be ruined. They agreed, but did not know sp here to get another to replace it. He promised to mako them a present of one. The old Boer was aghast! \"But,\" he said, \"the English do not know anything about the Bible.\" How- ever, the book, printed in Dutch by the Bible Society, was duly presented. Of course, in- st-ead of the Dutch Arms it had the English Arms on the front page. The old man pointed this out. 'That is not the Bib e,\" he said. A little further examination showed him, however, to his amazement, that this was only a matter of printing, and that otherwise the two were identical. The explanation as to the Arms led to a reference to the translaticn. --Translation? \" said the old man. \"This is no translation. The words were originally said in Dutch.\" Literally, that represents the ordinary state of the up-country Boer mind. They look -upon the promises and threatenings of the old Testament its personally addressed to them- selves and llicir forefathers. They worship a purely tribat. God, who has given over *~ [heathen -As a prey to their teeth,\" and they, feeling fhn~elives fully jnstified in so doing, act towards them accordingly.

We sustained no looses at all. The Boers were cleared out on all three uccasions, fact, soon we got within charging distance they mounted their horses and ran away. I think in time we *hall drive tnem out of it altogether. The third battle, which was two days after the ?eccnd. was awful affair. We were under fire for over ten hours. Fancy bullets and shells flying over and amongst yon ail that time, and seeing comrades fall one after the other. If that would not make the strongest timid for the time being I don't know what would. We had had breakfaat about 4 a.m., and had nothing more to eat drink that day\u2014not even a drop of water\u2014and we were fighting from about 7 am. till p.m. soon as it began to get dark we formed up to charge the Boers out their trenches, and when we got there to our dismay there was not a Boer to be seen except killed and wounded, we walked into their position. Thus another victory was won for the British. Since the last battle, which was the 28th, have liad a standing camp, so have done fighting, and feel much better for the rest we have had. I don't know when we start fighting again, but I suppoee it won't long now before we I keeping in good health. ANXIOUS TO MEET THE BOERS.

A Nottingham reservist with tho King's Royai Rifles, now in Natal, ribes his experience on landing iu the following to friend: At last we have arrived on the tield. We reached Durban eariy the morning the November, being put shore in lighters, which took time, owing the Servia drawing too much water. One would think tint they would have better accommodation here than they have, for the place is fairly large, and very interesting. You rememb.-r the niggers we saw Earl's Court running about with the light phaeton. Well, this place is swarmed with them. When we landed the thing that our notice was enthusiastic crowd civilians. refusers\" learnt they were, who loaded with bananas, matches, cigarettes, tobaccie, cocoanuts. bread, ami almost anything you could mention, and then tliere were ladies grin? about among the troops taking their names, so that they could drop a line to their friends telling their safe \"arrival. By-the-byc. got one them to send my watch home forme. You might let me know whether you get it safe, although have fear, is a committee that is doing this. They .ire wosvlerful'.y good here; far more Than they are at home. So much for Durban. We \"ntraincd at night for River, small place few miles below Eatcourt. The troops are in wonderful spirits; in fact, the other night, we came alone in the tram, one would'have thought they were a party school children going an excursion, instead a battalion men going into action. Myself. I can scarcely realise that we are in the field of battie. A couple cf days before we arrived here the Boers shelled the place for o\\?er sis hours, but to look at it none would think that such a thing had occurred, the natives are all work in the fields, and everything is usual Wo went out the morning of t-he 3Cth*for a skirmish over the hills, for a bit of a constitutional alter our three weeks' voyage. toucher ground I hive never been over can quite understand why the Boers have held their ground io well\u2014the country is nothing but hills. But. however when I write you neat shall, or I hope 1 shall, be able give you a dwcription m*- first flght. for which I feel rather a craving. I feel though 1 should like hear the leaden visitors whistling \" God save the round head. Of course, nothing further. A severe thunderstorm passed over liere last night (the November) and almost swamped out. This morning we went for a l\u00bbathe at 5. It is rath*\"** noveltv bathing so in the year, but the hesit here in the daytime terrific, while night it is just the reverse. In fact, at ni\u00ab?ht I sleep in all and overcoat, with mv blanket wrapped round me. There one thing, we are being better fed since we landed than we were on board *hip. There has been a forest on fire just outside the camp since have been here: it leeks very nice at night. It rather strange sight see the Kstftr drivers with teams oxen from twelve twenty.

{"ocr": "SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. \u2666 PAST RACING. j Holiday folks were well provided for as far as ! \u2022egards raciug, and in spite of drawbacks caused I vt previous vagaries in respect of weather the several meetings at Kempton, Dunstall, and i Hurst Parks were brought to a satisfactory issue, j Further north Turfites were not so fortunate, I \u25a0.nice the promised celebrations at Keele Park ?? md Haydock bad perforce to be abandoned. Model, j worthless as a liat racer, has done well between the i Sags since he was purchased in a \"job lot\" for! little money by Mr. E. Woodland, and, after cleverly repeating a success of twelve months j since in the Hampton Steeplechase Handicap, he accomplished a far more creditable performance under his 121b penalty by defeating Uncle Jack, to whom he was conceding a stone in the Sunbury Handicap. That this was true running may be doubted, and should they meet again on similar terms the piacings would probably be reversed. Lord William Beresford, happily recoveiing nicely j from an attack of influenza, has not been over-favoured with Dame Fortune's smiles since the jumping business commenced, well as he started with Lord Arravale and Heal at Birming- ham, and it was a welcome change after a series of reverses to see the spell broken by St. Pat in the Mortlake Steeplechase. In the mean- while a lot of money had been lost over Lord Arravale in the Kempton Park Steeplechase, won by Lady Gilueroy, and even admitting that \"his lordship\" was unlucky when, with the race in hand, he fell in the Great Sandown Steeple- chase it may be that he has been generally over- rated. School Girl, in the same stable, succumbed by a head to the uncertain Little Hercules in the Richmond Maiden Hurdle Race, and altogether the followers of Escott's stable had an expensive outing on Wednesday. Soliman, once the pro- perty of Lord Durham, if not comparable with some recent hurdle champions, such as Chandos, Helper, Prudhomme, &c, is nevertheless a good horse, and has proved a grand bargain to his popular owner, Mr. Higham. Some of his smartest, work has been accomplished in the Sunbury Yale, and, having carried 12st 7ib successfully in each of the two preceding years, a third victory awaited him in the Christinas Hurdle Handicap, which he won in gieat style from Snarley Vow and some other winning per- formers, of whom Irish Girl may shortly earn brackets. A heavy plunge on tlie Australian horse Battalion 11. was upset by Thurling in the Twicken- ham Hurdle Race, and the form was enhanced later in the week when Mr. My burgh's horse gave ,'illb, and only succumbed after a desperate finht to Lady Derry in a similar afiair at Hurst Park. Easily as Sheriffs Officer annexed the Park Maiden Steeplechase he had little chance with Bell Sound in the Hurst Maiden Steeplechase, but Free Fight took selling honours at both meetings, and hav- ing regard to the preceding and subsequent successes of Dummy, whom he defeated pointless, the neatly- named son of Beudigo and Licentious should not be long before recovering with interest the 150l\u00bbs. for which Mr. C. Hibbert purchased him. Though a good favourite, the Windsor winner Monachus could make but feeble show against Intimi- dater for the Kingston Hurdle Handicap on Friday, when chief interest centred in the Christmas Handicap. The Kempton and Sandown form pointed to the chances respectively held by Snarley Vow and Cynosurus, but neither could tackle the friendless Servius, and, whereas the former could get, no nearer than third, the son of Sainfoin and Cydonia simply refused to gallop, and was never in it, though he can go when he likes, and if in a more amiable frame of mind may make amends at Manchester to-morrow, where, by the way. Battalion 11. has a first-rate chance in the Maiden Hurdle Race this afternoon. Previous disappointments were condoned when Uncle Jack won the Old Year Handicap Steeple- chase all ends up, and again when School Girl, in the same stable, with 101b comparative advantage in the weights, turned the tables decisively in the Juvenile Hurdle Race on her Sandown conqueror Marauder, who is perhaps the best ofthe moderate lot of beginners that have so far this season been seen over timber. ** First Tuesday\" ix January. To the uninitiated this may seem a meaningless phrase, but to those better informed on Turf matters it will be recognised as one of the most im- portant days in the New Year by reason of the heavy list of great races due to close to-morrow. At upwards of seventy meetings stakes of greater or less attraction are advertised for entry, one of the most interesting being the Ascot Gold Cup, value 1,000 soys, with 3,000 soys in specie iv addition, lt may be hoped that Flying Fox, unfortunately disqualified for all previous engagements by the death of his late owner, the Duke of Westminster, will be included in the. entry, as in that case only good health will be required to ensure his victory over any opposition, whether English or foreign, and opportunity would be afforded of setting the final seal on his fame as a great racehorse. Other notable events due to close for the Royal meeting are the Alexandra Plate, a still more severe test of stamina, for next summer, and the Rous Memorial for 1901. Most popular of all the London meetings with the \"Cockney\" element is Alexandra Park, and, true to its policy of advance, the executive has launched out liberally iv respect of its April fixture. Restricted to one day onlj', the programmeembraces events worth in the aggregate \u00a3'.\"), 200. The London Cup, one mile and a quarcer, has been raised in value from \u00a31,000 to twice that amount, and with the entrance fee levied at the peppercorn rate of \u00a31 enterprise should be rewarded with an immense subscription. Messrs. Pratt and Co. are nothing if not thorough in everything they undertake, this remark applying not more to the fortunes of the Muswell Hill ven- ture than to all other meetings under their control, and little doubt but that the great improvements which have latterly been effected at \" the Park\" will be extended to the less pretentious National Hunt affair at Plumpton, which has but recently been handed over to their management. Efforts will be made, and no doubt successfully, to build up the strength of both clubs, at once influentially and numerically, and equally probable is it that the tone of sport at the popular Sussex fixture will be raised to a higher level than has hitherto obtained. Enterprise has, from the outset, been a prominent feature in the conduct of affairs at Gatwick, and at the National Hunt Meeting in March we are promised a variety of attractions. The minor forfeit for the Tantivy Steeplechase, handsomely endowed with 1,000 soys., is due for declaration to-morrow. At the same time nominations must be made for the Inter- national Hurdle Race Handicap of 800 soys. \u2014 to be increased to 1000 soys. if forty enter \u2014 and, passing on to tho Slay Meeting under Jockey Club regime, we have the Alexandra Handicap of six furlongs and the Prince's Handicap of one mile and a half. Each is worth 1,000 soys., and a tempting bait in respect of the latter is thrown out in the shape of a small entrance fee of 1 soy. In marked contradistinction 5 soys. is asked for the Spring Handicap, a pre- cisely similar race, at Hurst Park, but, on the other hand, liberal terms are offered to owners in respect of the New Century Steeplechase of 1,000 soys., a weight-for-age affair which will constitute the piece de resistance at the March Meeting. Hawthorn Hill, Haydock, Derby, Lingfield, Nottingham, Northampton, Tarporley, Redcar, York, Warwick, Wolverhampton, Worcester, and Sandown Park all bid more or less liberally for support in both branches of the national sport* and, though the absence of many Turf patrons on foreign service must of necessity have due effect, the outlook is not unpromising. The Spring Handicaps. With the next issue of the Racing Calendar, in its sheet form, we shall be placed in possession of the entries for some of the most important of the early handicaps, which will afford interesting study until such time as they are supplemented by the weights. The conditions in some few instances have been amended, but remain unchanged as far as regards the Chester Cup of 2,550 soys., inclusive of a cup value \u00a350, with its pendant of a prize Cheshire cheese to the several owners of the threo placed horses. The handicapper will be Mr. R. K. Mainwaring. Next in order come the Great Metropolitan Stakes of 1,000 soys. and the City and Suburban of 2,000 soys., the chief attractions ofthe Epsom Spring Meeting, and special note will be made of the increase by one-half of the value of the Queen's Prize Handicap, now worth 1,500 sovs.,and run over a distance of one mile and a half at Kempton Park on Easter Monday. At considerable cost the Sunbury Executive' has acquired additional ground, which will admit of the construction of a new straight quarter of a mile which is to be prefixed to the Jubilee Course, and will be a vast improvement. Already a large number of trees have been cut down in order to afford an uninterrupted view of this popular race, and though the value of the stake has been restored to \u00a33,000 the entry has been reduced to the modest \" fiv>r.\" Other items to close here are the Westmins.er Plate (1,000 soys.) at the June Meeting and the International Breeders' Foal Stakes in 1901 No change is noticeable in regard to the Lincoh shire Handicap, and the usual liberality has been observed in respect of the Liverpool programme, which boasts\" the sprint handicapo, viz., the Prince of Wales and Hylton Plates, In support of rhe Spring Cup (1,000 bovi.) in tho flat-racing department, while the Grand , National Steeplechase st&nds out as boldly as ever with its 2.600 soys. value and a first forfeit of 5 soys. Mention may also be made of two rich prizes in the Great Lancashire Breeders' Produce and St. George Stakes \u2014 entrance in euch caso I 1 gov.\u2014 for 11)02. The Easter celebration at Manchester is, as usual, confined to National Hunt I racing, and splendid prizes are offered \u2014 in the I Lancashire Handicap Steeplechase of 2,000 soys. j and the Jubilee Hurdle Handicap of 1,000 soys. I Mr. T. F. Dawkins will be the handicapper, and it i seems almost a pity that the weights for the cross- country event are due to appear simultaneously : with those for the Liverpool Grand National, as a much better chance would have been afforded him had the handicap been delayed until after tho decision of the big event at Aintree, which mi^ht easily have been arranged, since the one precedes the other by more than a fortnight.

{"ocr": "MILITARY MOVEMENTS. The Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, who is brotherin-law L:>rd Lansdowne, Minister for War, explains that the draft suggestions'- he is unofficially encouraged by the War Office to recommend\" are that in the neighbourhood of a garrison or depot or volunteer headquarters men might be admitted to join classes of instruction in drill and rifle practice with the approval of the commanding officers. They should take the oath allegiance and sigu the roll, but should not thereby become liable for any uniform or arms or earn any capitation grant unless and until tbey actually join the corps, Tbe Commanding Officer could stiike any man off the roll for misconduct or non attendance. Tbe men might supplied with arms lent for the purpose of drill, aud instruction might be given by the non-commissioned officers the regular Militia and Volunteer officers. This preparation for military service of large bodies of men would entail no cost on the country, and would not compel each Volunteers to leave their employment while a strong reserve would be found to replace the troops sent away if further events should make this necessary. Employers aid movements the allowance of time to their employe's for drill, and incidental expenses, which would not be large, may be met local subscriptions. Aldershot correspondent states that the first Militia battalion to volunteer for active service\u2014\u2022 the 3rd Durham Light Infantry, in barracks at North Camp\u2014have received orders to prepare to embark for South Africa about January lltb. They are commanded by Lieut-Colonel R. B. Wilson, an officer specially mentioned his examination tactics. The battalion is 800 strong barracks, but has an effective strength of considerably over 1,000. The men are mostly colliers and ironworkers from the Tyne district, and are of magnificent physique, and pat great heart into their soldiering. The steamers Garth Castle and Briton will leave on'Satnrday, January 13th, with 250 men each of the City of London Imperial Volunteers for South Africa, and the Wilson Liner Ariosto will convey tbe remaining five hundred about the same period or a little later. The Lord Mayor of London's fand for the equipment and transport of the forje amounts to \u00a380,000. Col Sir Howaid Vincent, M p., who has been selected for a volunteer command in South Africa took farewell of his regiment, tbe Queens Westminster Volunteers on Friday their headquarters London. The Drill Hall was packed, and Sir Howard was received with every demonstration of affectionate enthusiasm. Addressing the men he explained how his repeated offers to provide a regiment of one thousand marksmen drawn from all parts of the for service South Africa, and the Queen's Westminster for garriaou duty home, had been refused, although tbe Government were now accepting similar offers from all directions. In the present circumstances he thought it better to fall ia with the Lord Mayor of London* scheme and help the City of London Imperial Volunteer Regiment. Personally bad accepted the offer of a command of the infantry portion of that regiment under Colonel Mackinnon (loud cheers). Of the Queen's Westminsters 36 officers and 892 men bad offered their services to the;Governme\u00dft. For the present 40 and 20 reservists of the regiment *ould join the City regiment, which consisted of the mounted infantry section commanded by Cofoael Cholmondeley, and Field Artillery Battery would, he was sure, give a good' account of itself.

Being a Volunteer your- self, yon would render me a great service if you could tell me the names of any men in your corps who are good shots and riders and who would like to join the company for active service.

SUCCESSFUL NIGHT MARCH BY 6EBERAL PEENCH Fin-ther p*__ou_ws are to hand with reference to the successes of General French, who has been keeping the enemy constantly on the move in the north of Cape Colony. After the retirement of the enemy to Co__berg General French, saya the Central News carrespemdent, pressed them closely on Saturday and Sunday, giving them no tune to make a prolonged stand. On Sunday night all our cavahy, artillery, and infantry\u2014 the latter riding in waggons to in creaee the general n ltrb Qity of the advr-j nee \u2014 started upon * night march with the object of turning the enemy's right flank. The oper-tions were brilliantly won\u2014 fed. When day broke, we were within striking dis- tance of the enemy. Our infantry and field bat- teries at once made a feint atta c k upon the Boer front, and, while the s was prciceedarig, our cavalry and light artillery got right round the enemy's right flank as arranged. The programme worked without a hitch. The Boers were utterly sur- prised, and finding their retreat tiirea tened, they fled in d Lsorder to the e_ stward, leaving Coles- berg in our hands. TEE SITUATION ON TflE TUGELA The Central News special correspondent says : \u2014 A patrol of the 13th Hussars, scouting to-day to tbe westward, discovered a party of Boers en- deavouring to mount a gun. The Hnssa rs ad- vanced, and the Boers hurriedly retired with the gun. This incident occurred about six miles from the western extremity of our camp. Our patrols report that we.grons are still making for tiie new Boer camp, in the direction of Spring- field. It is clear tli*t the enerr ly ate in very strong force in tbe Upper Tugela. dis- trict. They apparently lielieve our plan is to work rotuid their right flank, and they are taking every precaution to be prepared for the movement. A party of Th* -m^ycrnf t*s Horse nude a demons trat i v in froiit < >f Hlangwane Hill today, and '\u25a0iiccecded in drawing tlie] enemy's fire. Tbe B. era opened a heavy riflo \u25a0 fire at extn.me range, an 1 afterwards brought; into anion two quick-firing rich', pieces, a Ma_im- N.irdenfeld gxm, and a Maxim. Tue r-rtdlery fire was not well directed, and Lite liiie fire, owing to the length of tbe range, was quite tn- efiVetire. Thc-rneyer-.ft's men, however, sue* e-eded in putting a few of the Boers out of action. The exact number of the enemy's ca_u_i- tbv cannot be gi\\eu, as our men did not come rloee eniaigb to ascertain tbe ofrcc-t of their fire. Tiie Naval guns again to-day shelled some of the enemy's trenches. The shooting was re-raark- aoiy \u00bbx.i<t, and the Boers were temporarily com- pel hd t-.^ _L_ adon them.

{"ocr": "THE TURF. SPORTING-NOTES BY \"WHITE AND GOLD.\" London, Saturday. Y There is not a more useful member of the Jockey Club than Lord Stanley,. and it was generally thought that he would be the next steward. He wilt however, in the moment.of danger be found rnthe front -of batte, and will join Lord Dow-ne, who is an ea-steward of the. Jockey-la.4 on theyst of Lord Roberta Lord Downe, at the time he was teward, wasc olonel of the 10th Hnsasrs, and as he afterwars had a -command in Ireland we.,did not see =-nchbof\u00a3 hrn at Newnarket. Lord Stanley, who has seen imilitary service in the Grenadierflnxrds, hM -for a long time been endeavouring to place restric- i tions on two-year-old racing, but so far vested; , interests have proved too strong for him. Th- Earl of Durham, who is now senior steward, Will vacate office in ApriL Mr M'Calmont -would be a very good. man to take his ple, seeing-that he bought the Duke of Rutland's estate near New- market, arnd for some part of the Heath is the; - landlord of the Jockey Club. He is, however, a I Lvoy keen soldier. and as he ocunmands the - Warwickshire Militia, I do not suppose that we shall see much of him next year. When I first; linew him he was a lieutenant in the Scots Guards, of which regiment he was adjutant. On the night that he won the Ascot Gold Cup with Timothy I met him at dinner in London, and at -a very early hour he left for Cat~erham to see I .after his; regimental duties. Though he is the! lonly subaltern w ho ever wvon this magnificent ij trophy, the fact did not make the slightest differ- enec to his ordinary mode of Life. W-ith a um-r hberof yeornanry officers volunteering for service it is very probable that other members of E ?? go. Under the cir(-uinstanC- . L vwe may see that standing dish Mir James - ?? one' more a steward The TlaLe Admiral ! Rous, when his turn to vacate office came. wa s invariably re-elected, and there can ho no doubt i that be loved the work. I think it is the same wv itth Mr Lowther, who is more nearly like what i Admiral Prous was than any other mierecr tof \" the club. A man who would make a very good I r steward is Mr Ernest Paget, hut it i; to he| feared that the Midland Railway claims too tmuch of his time. Two vera good names have dropped out- of the Jockey Club d sing the, crresent year in the Dukles of BearFor'; and 1 Westminster, and they will be very difficult to replace. The present Duke of Beaufort carns \\ for nothing but hunting, and it was because - he -wanted the horses at Badminton that the late Duke's stud Was sold. The Duske of West- i minster's stud will in all probability be carried on as before. Had he lived it is not li-ely that L Flying Fox -would have been entered for tho Ascot Cup. We shall next week scan the entry for that race with great curiosity to see vl-etlmr I his name appears in it or not, as this will indi- 3 cate the colicy that will be pursued in regari to - the stud. The number of Dukes vwho are con- nected with the tori as members of the Jockey 7 Clob is smaller than has ever been k-nown ALL that are left are the Dukes of Portland,Montrose, Devonshire, and Richmond. Dukes that have - dropped out in my time in additon to Bea-Tfore and Westminster are Hamilton, St Albans, NewNv- castle, Cleveland, and Rutland. This is a large number considering how few Dukes there are. The Jockey Club all round is mach weaker than it formerly was, and this in face of -he fact that there is two or three times as much racing l now as there used to be. In the old times men who were in any way connected with trade or finance had no chance whatever of getting i into the club, and it was a 1ong time before the ice, w;a broken by the election of Mr Leo. de Rothschild. Mr Merry. though as an owner of horses a better supporter of the turf than most members of the Joclkrv Club. never rained entry to that body, nor did Mr Naylor. I Even a merchant prince like Sir Robert Jardine wea kept out for years. It was the stordv coentry squires who were without title. and were proud of it, who objected so much to the trading element, and they were well sopported by the late Lord Glasgow, who suoneeded in shutting the door on the late Sir Robert Peel, remnarking that it would take two more u-ensra- tions to cross all the cotton out of that family. Of the Dukes who remain to us the Duke of Richmond. who is 81 yours of ago, has no hores, l and the Duke of Morrtrose has merely one or two platers. The strength of the \" strawberry leaves \" therefore in reality rests on two only- Vi_., the Dukces of Devonshire and Portland. They are both well tried, and come of honses historic irs their support of the turf. One of the most Prorminent objects in the grand stair- case at Chatsworth is a portrait of Fling 1. Childers, who belonged to the Duke of Devon- shire of the period, and it may be noted that the straw jacket was first registered to the family, as far back as 1762. The \" white jacket, black sleeves and cap\" of the muke of Portland am peared for the first time in 1817, end two years . later they were carried to victory by Tiressas in L the Derby. Of the great families, the Devon- shires and the Grosvenors have been the l stmunchest in their support of the turf, which almost would seem to have been a Whig rather than a Tory sport. It-is not without interest to note that witliiri six 'ears of the first race for the Challenee Whip at Newnarket it was won by Lord Grosveabr with -Gimhcracki: Lord Grosvenor held the Whin with Gimcrack for no L fewer then fires year There was a time when to hold the Cup or- -Whip was to be regarded as the champion of the turf. There was none of that senitiment. however, about the late Dmke of - Westminster, and even the Ascot Can was a matter of in- difference to him when there was a richer I stake to be won elsewhere. It has been re- marked of him tbat, with all his wenlth, he was one of the most practical men that ever I lived. and, strange to say both of hrim and the late Lord Felmouth, it must be said that they never owned a horse that as a long-distance runner woulI compare with the Caup winners - of bygone days. Of Flying Fox in this degree we cannot, of course, at present speak. Lord Faenouth's turf career was on even Ioftie lines than those which governed the Duke of Westmir.ster. He had a great dislike to handi- . cans, an-d he woeld have considered his colours dishonoured bad they been seen in a selling race. The Duke of Westmninster ran his horses in both these classes, but it must be said that when he put a horse in a selling race it was with fone express intention of getting rid of him. I never- kcew a horse of his that won one of these races that was ever bought back. It was this policy of his that I had in view when I advocated that when a man won a selling race he should not be allowed to buy the horse back. If this were to be done a great blow would be struck at gambling. The intention in allowing selling, races was good, but there has been so much 1 abuse in connection with them that it would be better i tifr. s--re swept away altogether. When a man ;p tt:; X horse in a selling race for, the sole purpose 'i getting rid of the animal I he is engaged in a legitimate pursuit, but when he puts a horse that is worth \u00a31000 in a race to be sold for \u00a350, solely to allow him to back him for BI0,= -without much risk of losing, be is engaged in a transaction that ought to be prohibited. Unfortunately these are the races that bring in the most grist to the mill, and for that reason there is no chance of them being put down. The Jockey Club at one time had their opportunity, but they missed it. Formerly at Newmarket win- ners of selling races were not saod by auction, consequently the owner bad not theopporta-oity out of his winnings to outbid all his opponents. The winner might be claimed by the owner of any other horse running in the race, the second havng, of course, the first claim. Woe to that- man who put a valuable horse into a race and wonitw, ?? StMachl .-ran -second, as he was sura to lose hum- Flying Fox was in fourraocs of \u00a3810,000 each next year, and one in 190L The lot were a. ,mere matter of health for him, and it is just on the cards thst had the fluke lived the totaL winnings -of the horse would haee far exceeded -\u00a310,000. Now that he can no longer run for these races, the Prince of Wales looks to have an excellent chance of winning some of them with Diamond Jubilee, and one at least of them would have been a real good thing for him but -for the race he won last back-end when he beat Paiale by a head. Instesad of coming in for a good allowance he wil now bawe to carry a penalty. I am quite satisfied that we hve not. yet seen the best of Lord Rosebery's beautiful Ladas Wclts. It has always been considered that they wanted time, more partioulaziy Sailor Lad. Though I hope to sec this horse in the Derby, it is quite open to Lord Roseber to play the game with him that the Duke of Westminster did with Regret. and -keep him for the Princess - of Wales's Stakes of 10000 guineas at I New-market in which he would meet ! the winner of the Derby, with a pull of 171b. i in the weights. It would be with regret that I I should see him do this, as I hoped to see - the horse take classical honours. The Prince of Wales has Diamond Jubilee in this race, and there are also engaged Democrat, Caiman, Boniface, Mahdi, Peigle, Old Buck IL, Scin- tflant, and fanners. It is in. connection with the Century Sakes, however, that the absence of Flying Fox will have the most effect. That' race, which will be of the value of \u00a310,000,1 was intended to mark the century, and, unlike 1 all other races of this character, the distace was fixed at two miles. To the general sur- prise, it obtained the large number of 221 sub- scribers. Of this number, 200 had not the Ithe slightest chance so lon gas Flying Fox was ? in it, hout now it looks like being w~on by a very! common nurse. The good-looking Kent would Ihave mnatters altogether his own way if he were 1 Fto run as he did when nut half trained. He: finished second to Dominie II. for the New-! market Plato, and in front of such horses as Harro-w, Frontier, St Gris, and Scintillnt. Unofortunately be gave avry diff eren t display in thle Prince of Wales StasatAcfo which odds was laid On him. lie ran all over the place with Sloan, and made such a poor use of his light weight that he finished fifth ' in a, field of seven. He could not, with com-mon decency, finish behind-suchi horses as Lord Bra- sideet and Polyorsetesa. I do not put dlown this- running as true On the part of Kent, and think that at Ascot Sloan was not ridling at al like a the jockey that he is supposed to be. To put. .it roidly, I have seena him ride many bettert . races. A far more serious matter is that Kent a -was -cot seen dtmring:the season manzy as-'were,- he canot. stand another prepastion. B That he was a diffoult home :to train I knw, wich nz te reson wiry hej did ot t as twoyea-old Anendeziavorw wilt ho made to ?? him up for the ?? ao maiden a ow-,moe. Of the wirrrers, the best .are.

This was more particularly so in the n daswises Lord William Bet-asiard man aged his 'r stuc. It was reumoured that Lord William in- tended -visiting India this winier te- see'the race, o ;ibest the latest news concerning himn is that he is d: i-s bed at Deepdene, suffering from influenza. i~ What will inlterest turfites most in connect~ion with, the Viecroy's Cop is that Up Guardis ran en the name of the Maharajalh of Jodphur. al le- When lie won the Ches~ter Cup he was objected a?1 to to on the-ground that there were interests in him 1) v- Ithat were not registered, and it was broadly ik ae stated that he was in reality the Ea I property of the Malharajah, for whom 3 3he ha~d been purchased by Mr Pach. 1I '0 Nhot a merely an agent in the matter. 1 'Nt niv did the stewards dismiss the objection, B 'tt but tbejrnled that it was frivolous and vexatious, Ai bn indte objector \u00a3-5. The recent race sheds a vrycuiousld hton all this. The horse it will ' Ih be seen, went to India, as it was stated he would. za itgo; he ran for the Viceroy's'Cup, as it was stated At he would run, and it was in the snae of a ItcMslharaialc.

There was nothiog scored In the second half. Although Wincbcombe had all the boat of the game they could not break through the defence, which was eery good on the part of Abbey. Griffin played champion game, and was withont doubt the best man on the field. Winchcomhe hnee now played fieo matches, having won and lost three; goals lor 12, against 8. A disappointing affair the result the meeting of Bt. Paul United and S'.M.C.A. Neither side were fully represented at the commencement. Only once during the whole game did the United have goal-kick, and that was the sequel along, shot just before the close. As this would tend to show St. Paul\u2019s United were the aggressors throughout, and it was either due to the good defensive powers of the Y.M.. or the awfnl shooting of their opponents that the score was not far heavier than two goals. True Kt. Paul's United were au unusually disorganised team having two fresh players in the front rank, caused by Bloodwerth and Durham being so to speak \u2022\u2022crocked\"\u2014but even then that should have made no difference when pressing so contiunally. The Rev. H. E. Noott. the Y.11.C.A. custodian, shone about the best of the two teams, for though there was no sting whatever to the shots had to deal with, might have done much worse with the amount of work that fell to his lot. Unfortunate os it was for him put the ball through his own goal from a corner kick taken by Cook, it wan not surprising account of the number the United bad during the match.

{"ocr": "FLOODS IN YORKSHIRE. Disastrous floods are reported from South Yorkshire. The Riser Demme has burst its banks, and the Weth Mail Colliery is surrounded by water, which has also, found its way on to the bees of the Great Central way. Hundreds of acres of land are under water. Colonel Harry Cooper, aide-de-mom to the Queen, and chief staff-officer of tie Western District. who had been ordered to South to the staff of Lord Roberta es special serriee officer, left Devonport cm Saturday for Soutbantptost. whore be embarked on the steamship Moor.

Past trains leave Boerne End for Paddington at 4.21, 5.41. sad Ites IMPERIAL YEOMANRY. \"BOER SPIES.\" Mysterious warnings, in which the name of Dr. Leyds\" appears in ominous juxtaposition to the phrase of \" Boer spies,\" have reached the body charged with the formation of the Imperial Yeomanry for service in Bouth Africa. Danger of this description has been present to the minds of Lord Chesham and his colleagues at bead-quarters from the outset, and precautionary measures have been taken. Two or three circumstances which at the time seemed perfectly innocent now demonstrate the reality of the peril. The persistence of the communications has impelled the committee to adopt still further safeguards,%and the risk, it is hoped, has at length been reduced to vanishing-point. Members of the staff and squadron leaders were fixed upon on Saturday, but the appointments cannot be divulged until ratified by the War Office. It may be announced, however, that Mr. 3. Eaton- Smith has been nominated civilian secretary on the staff at home for six months, Dr. Maguire, the well-known Army \"coach,\" having consented to release this hard-working and invaluable expert for that period. I Among a host of other Peers, Lord Wantage and the Earl of Loildesborough\u2014the former Lord-Lieutenant of Berke, and the latter a deputy-lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire\u2014visited Suffolk-street,' and promised to advance the movement by every means in their power, both in their own counties and in London. Sir Simeon Stuart. recently so popular as City Marshal, and once a lieutenant in the sth Dragoons, is busily helping to perfect the arrangements at headquarters, and ho pe s to be sent to the front at an early date. The Marquis of Waterford, nephew of Lord Charles Bereeford, is actively assisting the Irish contingent, and the supreme control over the formation of the Dublin section has been entrusted by the Commander-in-Chief to the Earl of Longford. Saturday's recruits include Mr. CI. V. Briscoe and Mr. A. J. Wilson, wellknown hunting men ; Mr. J. Newman, of the United Hunt, Cork ; and Mr. James Rutherford, ex-M.F. H., Mayo. Pessimistic views obtain in certain quarters 'as to the probability of the Imperial Yeomanry attracting to its ranks the 8,000 or 10,000 men required by her Majesty's Government. We are in a poeition to affirm that apprehensions on this head are groundless so long as ilea present rate of recruiting is maintained. Actual figures are not yet to hand, but the abundance of callers at the Suffolkstreet offices, combined with the eagerness dia\u2022 played in the brigade centres throughout the mientry, render any misgivings absurd. Vshy we know not, but it is nevertheless true that some uncertainty exists respecting the status of the men. It may be stated, therefore, that immediately a member of the Imperial Yeomanry is enrolled he occupies exactly the same position with regard to pay and allowances as a cavalry soldier. He enlists, of course, either for one year or for the duration of the campaign, instead of for seven years with the colours and Stu years in the reserve, but immediately upon being sworn in he is Tommy Atkins to all intents and purposes. Amusing ineidenta crop up now and then in Suffolk-street. Men proffering their services are naturally asked, \" Can you ride I\" Various are the answers given. One candidate replied, \"Rather, seeing that I have been on a cattle rancho in Canada for eight or nine years.\" Another exclaimed, \" I rather fancy so, sir. I was formerly in the Dragoons, but am not called up because I have just passed out of the reserve.\" Candidate No. 1 then asked, \" Can you shoot ?\" Again \" Yes \" was the answer. \"But can you shoot a Boer at 800 yards without seeing him \" Well, sir, I'd try,\" was the prompt reply. All the applicants are interrogated as to age. One of them on Saturday did not quite appreciate the question, and apologetically inquired, \" What did you Bay, sir ?\" The officer varied the interrogatory by facetiously remarking \"We must be sure about the Anno Domini.\" \" Oh,\" innocently replied the recruit, \" money is no object, sir--not in the least.\" The laughter which ensued made the applicant suspect that he had put his foot into it somehow. That the weaker sex often entertain hazy notions 'respecting military titles was evidenced on Saturday. A lady called to ascertain whether her son had been chosen, and on rejoining her companion outside she was asked whether he had succeeded or not. She replied, \" Oh, yes,\" and then added, \" My husband, of course, would not think of letting Algy go out as a private in the Volunteers. But he is going as a trooper in the Yeomanry. That is ever so much nicer, you know.\" Lord Cheehatn, who is busier than ever as each day passes, goes to Buckingham to-day, instead of Rugby, as he had originally intended. It is hoped that at least 1,200 horses may be shipped to the Cape this week. They will thus overcome the effects of the voyage and become fit for work by the time the first draft of Imperial Yeomanry reaches the seat of war. Bucks is doing its duty. Sufficient men have enlisted to ensure the establishment of two companies representing 281 officers, non-commissioned officers, and men. Ono company will mobilise at the county town under Captain del Winton, of the Royal Bucks Hussars, and the other at High Wycombe, under Captain W. A. W. Lawson, late of the Scots Guards. Colonel the Hon. 0. S. Craven, Commandant of the Royal Berkshire Yeomanry, has obtained peicnistion from the War Office authorities to provide a complete company for the Impel.' it Yeomanry from Berkshire, and not in conjunction with the Middlesex Yeomanry, as was at first proposed. A company is therefore being ionized entirely of Berkshire men, under Berkshire officers, and those desirous of joining should communicate with Captain Waring, Beenham Grange, Reading. Lord Alwyne Compton, M.P. for North Beds, organiser of the local Yeomanry corps, had a vend reception on Saturday morning at Bedford Midland Station, when he met over 100 smart men, who fell in, headed by the band of the 3rd Bedford Regiment. The party proceeded direct to the barracks for enrolment and medical examination. It was only a week since Lord Alwyno Compton started to noise the corps. His lordship will take over the command, other Ancon being Captain Dundee and the Hon. F. Stanley. Among those who will serve in the corps is the Hon. Mowbray A. St. John. We are asked to state that Captain Luxmore is enrolling recruits for the regiment being organised by Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, at 8, Albany-court-yard, Picoadilly. Rooms have been very kindly placed st Captain Luxmore's convenience by Mr. A. Hastings Stewart. Applicants who can ride and shoot well and are medically fit will be welcomed.

Considering the counter attractions in tha town this must be inded pleasing. A programme, to which the most fastidious could not take. Exception to was sub- mitted to the entire satisfaction of both the audi- ence and the performers. When turns like Mdlle. Do-Dio, who is billed as \" the great fire dancer,\" arc provided, it is little wonder that the per- form\u2014noos are popular. This item was retained from last week, and the variation, thill, and grace combin ed, formed one of the chief events of tlie evening. Tlie Sisters ?? were loudly applauded for their dances, wliioh were very laudably executed Miss Blanche Vincent's songs were well rendered iv a manner which at once stamped Iter as a thorough music'\u2014 n and vocalist. Her turn was one of the most enjoyable, the ballads being appropriate to tlie present war as wore tliose of Lydia Dudley Ma rie Fandella also contributed in a large manner to the enjoyment of the even- ing, as did Charles Russell, the coster comedian. The cven'ng was not without mirth and amuse- ment, this portion of the programme being in the hands of Aldan and Theo. whose electrical offet+s were ma rvellous ; another performance ent rely amusing. The same may be said of Tony Wilson and Clown who as prem'er bar performers were very clever.

{"ocr": "1 FRERE CAMP INCIDENTS. \u2014 \u2014* + PREPARING FOR ADVANCE. FROM OUR WAR CORRESPONDENT.* FRERE CAMP, Dec. 8. This has bven a singularly uneventful week, the only real news being the arrival of General Buller at Frere, which he reached on Tuesday night. His movements have been kept most secret. Even the j fact of Lis being in camp was not allowed to be j cabled, home. The last three days have been chiefly \\ taken up by the concentration of troops at Frere I before the forward movement begins, and the camp nov? presents a formidable appearance. In addition to the Mounted Infantry already at Frere \u2014namely, Tiiorneycroft's and Bethune's and the section of Imperial Light Horse, Natal Carabiuiers, and Police\u2014 tho lst Royal Dragcons have come in accompanied by a squadron of the South African Light Horse, which has been raised in Capetown on lines similar to tho Imperial Light Horse. It is reported a thousand strong. Three more squadrons are on the road to Frere, a fourth having gone to the Western Border. This brings the present force of mounted men up to over two thousand strong. There are also live batteries of Field Artillery and seven battalions of Infantry : 2nd Devons, Borderers, 2nd West. Surrey (Queen's), 2nd East Surrey, 2nd Dublin Fusiliers, West Yorks, and 2nd Irish Fusiliers. The Durham Light In- fantry, the Scottish Rifles, the Somersets, 2nd Rifle Brigade, and 2nd ?? Ritles are also on their way, and the Royal Welsh and Scots Fusiliers leave Es\"t- courc to-morrow. The lst Dublin Fusiliers and Con- naught Rangers are also coming un. These will give four full brigades of Infantry. The 13th Hussars are on their way from Mooi River, and another battery is expected. This will give General Buller \\\\ fighting column of over eighteen thousand men, all of whom should be at Frere by Sunday. Reconnoitring near the Tugela. During the week the Mounted Infantry have been engaged in the usual patrol work, thelnfantry doing some skirmishing near the camp to keep them in condition. The weather during the early part of the week was cold and misty, but the last tiiree days have been excessively hot. Fortunately, the nights are always cool. The scouts reported the enemy still held strongly fortified positions on the north of the Tugela, round Colenso, and near Springfield, where there is a footbridge and a drift. They apparently hold positions at all likely cross- ings of the Tugela to rhe east and west of Colenso. On Tuesday General Clt?ry and his staif went out reconnoitring towards Colenso, and were tired on by the enemy's long range guns, which bore out the scouts' reports On Wednesday morning, how- ever,it was again reported that the enemy had retired from their positions, their guns not being visible. General Buller decided to make a reconnaissance in force, and or. Wednesday afternoon this was done. All the available mounted men, some twelve hundred strong, with a battery of attillery proceeded in the direction of Colenso under command of Lord Dundonald. Oa reaching Chieveley Station certain squadrons deployed to the right and left, tho main body with the guns going on towards Colenso, where they halted at the back of a ridge overlooking the Tugela. The advance guard meantime continued towards the river, where a {\u2022arty of some three hundred Boers were seen. The enemy refused to be drawn, however, not a shot being tired, though our men were well within range of the guns which engaged them when making a similar reconnaissance the previous Thursday. The Boers and General Bcller. The Boers had cither vacated these positions and, as further reported, taken up stronger ones north of Colenso, or had chosen to bo silent for some ulterior motives. The idea that the Boers had vacated their positions and taken up stronger ones is gety rally accepted, and the fact of su many dis- loyalists having recently been put under restraint dof.'otless accounts for the Boer Intelligence De- partment not being so well informed as in the earlier days of the campaign. A party of Boers were reported near Chieveley Station the previous day questioning natives and eager for informa- tion. Yesterday two Boers came to our out- lying pickets with a message, under a flag of truce, on the pretext, I understand, of in- quiring for two of their missing. While waiting for a reply they were kept quite five miles from camp. Their object was doubtless to ascertain our force at Frere, and it is possible. also that they were trying to tind out if General Buller was really at Frere, as from all accounts they take the deepest interest in his movements. It is for this reason that the censorship at. the moment is so rigid, uo movement of troops in any shape or form being passed until a strong forward movement is really made. Regarding the movement, it is impossible to form an opinion. The Boer positions behind Colenso appear almost impregnable, and it would be most diliicult to direct a frontal attack on them, as they command the crossing of the Tugela River. Naval Gins and TnE Searchlight. I omitted to state that there is a Naval Brigade also at Frere, with four long range 4'7in. guns from the Powerful and Terrible, besides several long range 12-pounders. As the 4*7 in. guns have a longer range than the enemy's, ifc may be that a demonstration will be made on their front under cover of the naval guns, which can be placed in commanding positions, while a strong force is sent to cross the river at another point and turn the enemy's flank. At Frere the naval searchlight, is working nightly, and Ladysmith has sent word that the signalling is understood there, so that, Sir George White being in direct touch with General Buller, a combined movement is certain to be made, lt is possible the enemy may foresee tiiis, and that they may, though it is extremely improbable, forsake their positions at Colenso, and fall back towards Ladysmith. There is no doubt from the persistent shelling of Ladysmith during tlie past few days that the Boers are making desperate attempts to force it. to surrender, as they well know- that when General Buller's force combines with Sir George White's their time has come. There i.s, fortunately, no possibility of Ladysmith giving way. In fact, the more shelling it gets the more determined, according to all accounts, it seems to hold out. Boers' Wives on the Si ene. Natives again report numbers of women in the i Boers' camps. It seems the Boer wives, who are very important factors in the country, are not satisfied with the official returns of their killed and wounded, and have insisted on coming aud finding out for themselves if their husbands and suns are still at the front. The Stamhwi end Dnnicr.7 Nei'-s. m a recent edition, I understand published the fact that many Boor women were leaving by special trains for Dundee, the reason given being that they were going picnicing. Should these ladies find that they have been deceived through official reports neither President Kruger nor General Joubert will have a very pleasant time. As far as one can see there will be no movement before Monday, but early in the coming week important developments are certain to take place, and much severe fighting is anticipated, the country from Coienso to Ladysmith being peculiarly well adapted to Boer tactics. If ono can believe native reports tho Boers are by no means happy. They still suffer from dysonterv, and this is not improved by their having to Hve on j fresh meat, and their horses are stated to be in ! very poor condition. All these things point to the rumour of dissension among the enemy being true. The Armoured Train Fight. Yesterday morning Major Chichester, the Pro- vost-Marshal, with a patred of Natal Carabiuiers arrested near Springfield four Natal farmers, who were found in possession of a quantity of looted furniture, &c. The patrol was fired on by six Boers without any casualties. The Carabmiers suc- ceeded in capturing the Boers' horses, which they shot, but the Boers themselves disappeared in a j donga, and unfortunately escaped. Early yesterday morning an impressive burial ; service was held at the graves of tlie Dublins and I Durban Light Infantry who were killed in the armoured train fight. Some four thousand troops I attended. The service was a combined one, i English and Roman Catholic. The grave now 1 >nks j very pretty, having stonework all round and a I simple tombstone. A quaint inscription of empty j cartridge cases found on the field has been mi- i geniously worked by the Border Regiment. It j reads as follows: \"Erected by tlu; Border Re\u00bbi- -! menfc ?? our comrades who fell on 15th November, I trust next week to send yon some good news.

{"ocr": "TRANSVAAL WAR. MILITAKY SITUATION DAY BY DAY. MONDAY. opening of the New Year finds the British forces io South Africa everywhere the defensive and mainly in two great groupings the extreme east and west of the tbeatre of war. Alike in the east and in the west, where the Boers have barred any direot advance by extensive entrenched positions daily growing in strength, Bays the Times, the present situation can only be described as one of stalemate. Our position here,\" telegraphs correspondent at Modder River, \"is an admirable one from the point of view of defence,\" and for nearly tbree weeks the opposing foroes have confronted each other, remaining content with occasional harmless interchange of shells at long range. General Cronje's troops at Mapiersfontein are estimated at from 20,000 24,000 men, and they appear well able to maintain their position and anxious to add to their defences. There is no immediate hope of relieving Kimberley, which, it report iB coi reot, will nnfortunateiy be the end its supplies by the middle ot the month. Until Lord Methuen's force ia able to nndertake field operations distance from the railway the Boera must apparently remain masters of the situation. Colonel Baden- Powell's resources must be nearly exhausted. In the last resort he will probably endeavour to out his way out to tbe northwards and to join Colonel Holdsworth near Mochndi. Karuman appears to be still held by a small force of police. The fall of these three places, which have been most gallantly defended, would not the least prejudice OHr present military position our future operations. Like the Sandbag battery at Inkerman, they have become gages of battle quite apart from their strategic importance. Since December 15th Sir Redvera Bailer baa apparently been occupied in oreanizing hia force and eqaipping it with transport. Five infantry battalions, together with drafts, and three field batteries have been diverted to Natal, The British forces aoutb of the number at least 26.000 men, and counting the 9,500 ttoopa under Sir George Wbite, the Boers Natal mu6t be considerably outnumbered. Tbeir central position, however, between the two British forces strategically strong in view of present immobility. Until General Buller has been able to equip a large flying column with transport, is not easy ace how he can make any movement of importance. Round tbe Boera are mounting additional guna to replace those destroyed in Sir George White's sorties, and are strengthening their position on Lombard's Kop, apparently with a view to prevent any attempt to break ont to the east. After two months' practice, their heavy Run fire is improving, and on tbe 22nd ult. six men of tbe Gloucester Regiment were Billed and nine wonnded a single sbelL In thoroughly unsatisfactory military position like Ladyamith the only wonder is that such resnlta have not been more frequently obtained ; but, although occasional casualties must be expected from prodigal expenditure of ammunition, the Boers now hope to reduce the garrison by bombardment, and the sorties which they are treated from time to time must entail mnch harassing work npon the investing force. There is no change in the situation of Gatacre and French with exception of the Indwe line now working again. We learn from General French's force Arundel that our experience shown tbat tbe Boera greatly dread cavalry with horee artillery.\" The total force or on tbe way to South Africa consists of 76 infantry battalions, 13 cavalry regiments, and 40 horse and field batteries, with abont 14,000 colonial troops. Besides these there are the Sixth and Seventh Infantry Divisions, two Militia battalions \u2014the -rd Durham Light Infantry and the 3rd South Lancashire, eaoh over 1,000 strong. Canada and Australasia are preparing further mounted contingents exceeding 2,000 men wit_ four field batteries, and offer more men required. Cape Colony is enrolling more mounted troop's who\u00dfe value the War Office bas length recognized. The Imperial Yeomanry and Volunteers are being organized, English fashion, mainly private enterprise. The Nizam of Haidarabad and the Maharajah of Gwalior have loyally placed their troops at tbe disposal of the Queen; Colonel Hutchinson, Nashville, Tennessee, offers the services of 200 Americana who took part the campaign in Cuba. There will be no lack of men for any requirement, and the organization of extemporized troops we excel. Me are, however, not the only or even the priucipa need of the moment. We have already more than 100,000 men tbe field who are at present com pletely held at bay. The military situatio remains very unsatisfactory, and much more additional troops is needed to rectify our positio and to vigorously prosecute an offensive war. Look ing back through the event\u00df of the past three months, during which we have lost nearly 7,000 men and ex perienced succession of reverses, a whole train o unfortunate ciicumatancea presents itself. The troop available for the initial defence of Natal were quote and moro could not be sent without either for mal mobilization, from the Governmen naturally shrank, or robbing the army of India to a undesirable extent. Whether any real plan oi defeno existed not known ; bat it is clear tbat nolitica considerations were permitted override militar necessity, with the usual results. Worse position than Dundee and Ladysmith conld not well have bee Belected, and the force at the former place narrowl escaped destruction or capture, only to effect con oentration at tbe latter and to be isolated from Nov 2nd. The Rituilar isolation of Kimberley and MaTo king was certainty as soon as the Boera could reac these places. Henceforth the beleaguered garrison practically ruled the couree of the campaign. On October 2nd Sir Redvers Buller arrived at Cap Town with a plan of concentrating a force on the Orange River for the invasion the Free State By November be was at Durban drawing t himself large forces for the relief of Ladyemith Tho plan had disappeared, and was assumed the exigencies of Sir George White's position deman ded supreme effort for his direot relief. Meanwhile the invasion Northern Cape Colony began en tailing destruction railways and a critical situation. While the Commander-in-Chief was \u25a0ea, Lord commenced bis advanoe from Orange River to the relief of and fonght four severe actions with loss 2,000 men, only to find hie further progress barred great intrenched poiition extending for many miles across his front December 10 General Gatacre courted and exporieaoed disaster which greatly aggravated tbe poll situation Cape Colony, and on the 16th Sir Kedvers Buller wea repulsed with a loss 1,200 men an extraordinary attack whioh left him facing impregnable poaition with enterprising enemy on his flank.. To the Kimberley and the Ladyamith line* the mass of our troopa remain committed, while the relief of the two garrisons teems no nearer when Lord atarted from Orange River and Sir Kedvera Boiler landed at urban.

The latter won in the fifth round. The first day the New Year brought brighter news from South Africa. General French, who is ujierating on the centre line of railway running through tho north Cape Colony into the Free State, has driven the enemy out of Coles berg and Is thus within twenty miles of their territory. His advance from junction has consisted of a series manoeuvres by a mobile force always checking the enemy in front while turning their flank and threatening their rear, and the result is that they have been steadily driven back. His jiurpose has been protect our communications between Aar and tho < River Station clearing the liters out of that tract of territory, a sort of rough parallelogram, formed by three lines of railway and Orange River, and has proved entirely successful. Yesterday morning, having advanced within striking distance under cover of the darkness. General French amused the Boers in front Coles berg while his cavalry and light artillery got to the west of their position. \u201cThe Boers were utterly surprised,\u201d says our Correspondent, \u201cand finding their retreat threatened, they fled disorder the eastward, leaving Colesberg in our hands.\u201d The direction taken them in theii fight appears show that they have no strong supports in tho parallelogram to which we have referred, though we cannot quite understand why they did not retreat northwards towards one other of the bridges nearest Colesberg. It may lie that these bridges are broken down, that the commando, outmarucuvred and defeated General French, could only escape the direction of Bethulie, falling into the rear of the invading column, which now at Stoimberg, facing General Gatacre and threatening an attack Dordrecht. General French had a sufficient force of men and transport lie might \u2022endanger the retreat of this column also, and bring it back quickly to the line of the Orange River. General French has probably the most mobile our columns; is comparatively strong in cavalry, mounted infantry, and horse artillery, and he cavalry officer of much experience. A flank movement seems to come naturally to him. He tried it, readers will remember, ElamUlauKe, r - THE x ORKSHIRE and cat up the Boer position there. Experience has shown hitherto that the enemy will not stand when they think their retreat is being blocked they will not stay to be caught. Perhaps this is prudent on their part; but it points to way of turning them out their positions whenever we can bring them force strong enough to bear division. But for success in turning movement, especially on extensive scale, great mobility is required. Geneial French, it will bo seen, carried bis infantry the country waggons, and this fact suggests that hitherto, save in Natal, we have heard little of requisitioning horses and waggons from South African farmers for military purposes. In Cape Colony there must immense number of animals seasoned to the climate, and the use of them would put us on equality with the enemy the matter of transport, in which have been and are deficient. We shall need a large supply even when the traction engines and their waggons are all serviceable, for there are obvious limitations to the employment traction engines on i-oads not provided with strong bridges for the crossing streams. This, however, is a question which, have no doubt, has been thoroughly considered by the authorities. The chief point to note the present moment is the success which Las attended a flanking movement made by a fairly mobile force, directed an officer who has given the enemy no time in which to dig successive rows of trenches. We expect that in the coming endeavour to relieve Ladysmith Sir Rbdvbbs Bi ller will be able to deliver a flank attack. This is also apparently the opinion of the Boers, for while they continue to hold the bills, which guard in some degree the passage the Tugela twenty miles eastward of Colenso, they have sent force westward in contemplation of movement by us on the little Tugela, there being good crossing at Springfield. General force is now estimated about 30,000, and some correspondents say that has seventy guns. cannot quite sec how he can have received such large reinforcements of artillery as would bring his guns nearly this figure; but at least should have between forty and fifty. This is not the full proportion of guns to infantry required by many modem authorities, but his artillery includes naval guns and Howitzers, so that it must regarded as strong\u2014whether stronger than that of the Boers now that they have in position the ten guns captured from Colonel Long and, it would seem, some six hundred rounds of ammunition for them, we do not know. In any case Sir Rbdvers Duller and his troops are eager to force the one or other of passages. Mr. Burleigh\u2019s statement that big battle is imminent receives confirmation in another special correspondent's message which publish to-day, and tho opinion is expressed that tho fight will decisive so far regards tho relief of The Boers have strengthened their entrenchments during the delay since the failure of the previous attempt at Colcnso; they are said to have sixteen miles of trenches, and hitherto the fire of our guns has not induced them to reveal tho position their artillery ; while the Llaogwane hills flanking Colenso the cast are still held by them in some force. We expect that preliminary to operations against Che Boer centre and flank, the enemy will be driven out Llangwanc, and a strong attack this position, with tho Tugela in flood, should practically annihilate all of them who are on the south side the river. We not ignore Mr. Bennbt Burleigh's remark that war is ever, more uncertain than cricket, Mr. Winston Churchill's statement\u2014a of the reports concerning the Boers \u2014that Africa is the country of lies ; but unless tho case of Ladysmith much more desperate than official and other telegrams have represented to be, are certain that Sir uveas Duller will not make his second attack without such knowledge of the enemy\u2019s position as may prevent another \u201cserious reverse,\" without trying whatever flank movement may be jiotisible. At the .same time it must bo recognised that, with the Tugela in flood and the roads in bad condition, it may not practicable lead infantry long way round, that frontal assaults, though costly, have been successful in jmsitions hardly less strong than those occupied the enemy, and that our losses in South Africa, though greater than had Wen anticipated, are far smaller thau have been sustained by victors in many important battles of the past. If Sir Reuvers Bi ller were to lose two three times as many men as in his last and yet inflicted a decisive defeat on General Joubcrt, could not complain. Mb. Montagu Crackanthobpe has raised the question of the danger of electric lighting when tho installation is protected wood casinga danger which seems to be greater now that the providers of electricity are increasing (he voltage from 200. The matter is of interest in many ports of the country, for the increase of the voltage\u2014though very detrimental to the consumer, whose bills grow rapidly unless ho lias had his lamp changed from the 100 to the 200 volt\u2014adds the danger where extra precautions are taken. Mr. Crackanthorpe\u2019s installation had the ordinary wood casing laid between floor and ceiling, and one night he was alarmed by tho smell of burning wood and the appearance rings of smoke between the edge of the carpet and tho hearth of his drawing-room. Walking to the door, his foot went through car)iet and boards just ovor the spot where rose lighted the room below, and flames burst forth, requiring attention with water-buckets. He is probably right saying that had the fire broken out an hour later his house would have been in much danger. His conclusion is\u2014and Professor Silvan Thompson agrees with him\u2014that woodcasing ought to be got rid of, and that all fuses and jomts should be in places accessible for inspection and not hidden away under floorings. Professor Thompson urges that insurance offices have given undue encouragement to the use fuses, \u201c with the result that there are far too many of them, and they are put in all sorts of bad places; for example, in ceiling roses and every place where flexibles are joined to the leads.\" The theory of the electrical engineer and\u2019 of the official from the Electrical Department of the London CouutyCouncil, who examined into the cause pf Mr. Montagu Cbackanthorpb\u2019s fire, is that some of the flexible wires feeding the \u201crose \" had become partially stripped their insulating coats, \u201cso that the current, instead of going through the lamp, found its way across what was first a minute interval of air, but which, when the switch was on, was sufficient to set up tiny arc light at that point. This arc light, the formation which was probably assisted by oxidisation the exposed wire, had tendency to increase in size, and at last it became }iowerful that, after consuming the wooden casing in which the wires are laid, and still further injuring the insulating fabric, it started short circuit. This, of course, blew out Ibe safety fuse, but not until the floor was well alight.\" We have quoted Blr. Cjucranthobpk's description, for on it is based his condemnation of wood casing where high voltage is cued. and. with ", "word": "2079", "description": "... and a reception was given to them the Yorkshire section.

To the Editor if the `Flx1n:arl's Jolurtll. |SNir -About a year ago the Irish Urniversity I IEdication quastion was the chief subject Of iaublio discus.ion. It is likel.- scn agaill to ilforce itself on publc attention, but, perhaps, in a n-ore moderate and reasonable way. I ?? been recantlv en gred in look ing into certain matters in connectioin with the Royal University, and have eompi'ed some tables which I think wvill be of general interest to the Irish 1)oplc. The Roval Universitv has been an experi- ment on a; .argle scale, Iand the public have now the advantage of le-arnian the results. In the vtaar 1881 the Queen's University was dissolved and tho Royal University csu-:b- lished. The followiinv t-ible shows the inmm- her of persons who obt-ined i:n thit year the DIegrees of MI D and 13) A re-sprctivelv in the Queen's Universitv and the Co'lges in l ?? they were educat--d.-- Y.3.D.

Thle degrees of 31 D and B A are the :nost important degrees, and to avaid too inuoh de- tail. I sio not deal with other degrees. Bv the Charter of the Roval Universitv the Senate waas empowered to; Coner degrees in all the faculties except the Medical on Exa- mination merelv. but in medisine only cn op- proved certificates of attendance abt col'ese and hospital with examination. It is recessai- in judging of the facts stated in this letter to bear in mind one important matter, via -that one half of the Fel'owships and Examinersisips wvent to tie Catholic University of Dublin, and the other half to the Queen'sa Colleges and Maicee College. Al'owing eright years to eiop'e so as to have a settled working basis estabdihed.

I1st-That all the Queen's Coilegsc3 have been jmuch impaired in their usefulness by the cstkub- lishnient of the Roiyal t'nvernvsy. 2nd-That the Arts Faculty in Cork hL9 been I ruined, and in Galway Cs not one-half what ia used to be. 3rd-That the Medical F' eculty in Cork is about half what iti waz, and inr Galrwa d&- struied. I 4th-That bath in arns and medic~ne the Uni- versity College. Dublin, and Catholic Universtty School of Aledicine. notwithstanding their lpre- dominant position and intl;uence, hlave failed t show vthe return of graduates vhich cutely was expected by the Government in estableiiarg she Royal University. In foci, from tlhat point ?? view the Royal University has been a mnesert u'l. failure. 5th-Fromt another Point of view, however, the Royai University results are reru rkdl:. In the thre years tuibul;ltedJ no less than 252 n;ut i'of- a tottl ot 420 wvho took the degree of B A, ! either studied in colleges Ors schccis not associj ated with the Un1iversity, cr studied privately. I find that veiy many \"othez colleges and schoolz\" in Ireland :have sent students t'o various arts exaeminncons of the University. For the first t'riveraitY Exmniinao-ion in arts in suinnier, :1339, there wore 48, fcr ;be second University Exa'innatiron in arts 32, and for the B A 17, such *i nst'tub ins wch sent students who passed the ' respective examinations. A consideimble nisam- I t'er of these collieges and schools have been bro'iht into ex.stence, or Ween given great I .mpetus by the Royal Urnivcrsety, and have aIC- * quired a sor't of veste1 diiht to degrees in erts b'b' examination, whict Parlia-nent cannot or justice ignore. I mav remark that it weaoll appear that the five ?? intehitely ' c-ed tel ib the I Unt-iversity seemn tn be chiefly resorted to in' arts by students desirous of i?.taining ho- nours and prizes, whilst the other colleges and schools are re'orted to chiefly by those merely des;rous of minss ,ogrses.

Having isnolied him, the spoken:ran of the party placed the halter in his hand, and forthwith began a recital of the mare's iniquities. In truth, they were light enough, yet the man seemed bent upon adding all in Ilg ower to their enormity. And so he told bow she, meaning the woman more than the more, had fled from justice. \"From those she should have clung to,\" to quote the man's eager words. \"Aye, and an evil, wicked spit she showed; kicking and biting like the very deuce at all who would come nigh her.._ It's the evil eye she has,\" the speaker continued, \"and that I can prove, for once, jt.A when young Jim the Runner, was close upon her, the brute she turned and looked at him, at which his legs gave under him and be fell to the ground.\" \"His foot caught in the heather, and that was why he fe'd. muttered Tawno sullenly. \"That's a lie!\" exclaim Jim, nicknamed the Runner. \"I was leaping, and my feet I went from under me. Didn't I feel her evil eye send a sliver through mer he questioned angrily; and none, of course, could contradict him. So they went on, first one and then another I speakMg, yet to all the same purpose\u2014all save, young Tawno, who loved the woman who had I been a mother to him since his own had died. At length, however, even the priest, who up Ito now had listened intent:yr, determined that he had beard enough, and, with an imperious wave of his hand, he silenced the babblers. \"Enough, enough!\" he exclaimed, \"By the laws of Egypt her guilt is proved beyond a doubt.\" Then, without pausing further, the old man commenced a wild oration in ha own I language, so wild, so weird, so terrible, that no man dare translate it into the tongue of l civilisation. Strangely enough, each word was spoken not l to the people who stood around, but to the innocent :irimal before him. And as he spoke, as he dwelt on the duty of wife to husband, a duty which he likened to a beast's devotiou to its master, the man seemed to work himself not into a. state of judicial indignation, but rather into frenzied madness. The scene was awful, the more so that these wild people, knowing no restraint, made no attempt at concealing the emotions which moved them so strangely. With g:owing eyes and parted lips they stood or sat upon the ' ground, with eyes brat eagerly on the speaker, who stood there in their m:dst, lost to all save fasnaslail\u2022witlThlreo-ldt;r3e.\"bauttet, htdlilicuriben7t2 an eagle's talons, were rained aloft; his white hide streamed in the wind; while the voice, wit:ch had been weak and quivering , now rose I to a shriek of madness, and tiny flakes of foam fell down on to she matted beard which fell from his lips down on to the matted beard which reached to his very waist. One truth, and one alone, this strange speaker) kept on repeating with ever-increasing vehatagrowing more lonely and wilder of aspect. Tire smooth moorland had been passed, and already the old priest was beginning to mount \u2022 deep bill which lay before them. Just as the last of the procession was beginning the ascent, and Orlon& was wondering ilia dazed fashion whether her small companion could last to the journey's end, a young ladies. in truth be was little mores--who had more 'than once cast an anxious glance behind him, dropped the stick he carried, as though by sic. I nident, and, with an exclamation of impationce, watched it roll to the bottom of the as' cent. To spring down the hill was the work of a moment, yet, having reached iathe lad seemed in no hurry to rejoin his companions, for as he came up with the woman and her child he caught the latter in his strung arms and commenced carrying her, with a certain rough tenderness which tam was not slow to appre- I d a t a \" Nay, Tuirno,\" whispered the woman, turning towards her new companion with a startled, frightened look ; \" get you forward. Sylventer Herne is scarce like to pardon disobedience to his order.\" What of him?\" the lad whispered, with an angry oath, his young face flushing trttli surprise at his own boldness. \" Hirsh !\" he continued, placing his finger on his line ; \"none may notice, and the chic is overweary for walhing,\" A quick glance of gratitude showed that the woman was not alone to appreciate his friendly action; while the ohlid played with the lads unkempt locks as she murmured sleepily: ' Good Tawno, Ercilla's legs was tired. Now MAW Ercilla's donkey. Gee up, donkey 1\" At length the top of the hill was reached, and there the prooessum stopped. As ishenally the case with our Diglish hills the summit of the one in question proved to be wide and almost level, and though on the side sealed by the gipsies the ascent was steep and somewhat rugged, on the other the ground sloped gently towards the dale beyond. It would have bees difficult indeed, even in the north of England, to find a wilder, more lonely spot, for, in truth. the gipeies, knowing every nook and cranny of the country, as only the Romany tribes can, had chosen their ground s,arefully. 'Tis true that in the wide, wild nuidecape before UAW], composed almost entirety of moorland, either covered with heather or coarse, wiry graas, a faint streak of smoke could here and there he seen ; yet these signs after all only denoted the presence of some shepherd's hut or tiny moorland farm, and wen the gipsies know that front the simple folk inhabiting those homes they had naught to fear. A moment only was taken for rest, then all pent formed a group around the man we have, for want of a better name, termed the high priest of the tribe. Now all that, followed, and each word that was spoken, was in that strange language known as 'Romany, a language about which perhaps less is known than any other, so jealously have all tine gipsies guarded r acer eearets. As, therefore, none are like to lmow much of the gipsy tongue, we are forced, both here and elsewhere, to traw-1 late, as closely as we can, the actual language used by those present. Although each one who stood there knew full well for what purpose the tribe had sought that lonely spot, none seemed ready to do aught save stand with eyes fixed intently upon the old priest, who 'tall occupied the centre of the group i The priest upon his part was apparently gnorant of all that was going on, as, seated on a, slab of rock, he fell to tracing strange marks and signs upon the ground at his feet. Suddenly, however, both the stillness and ileum were broken rudely, as the chief of the tram, Slvester Herne, leading his son, the powerfnl y Ambrose, pushed his way to Where the old man sat. Nark you, Brasio,\" the chief exclaimed. \"my son hes euffered great wenn at the band of the woman e --re called by his name. 'Tim yen who joined the two tegetim as matt add wife; 'tie to you we come when in would have that bond, that camped hoed, severed.\" The old man glowed from the speaker to his companion with a look of deep amishmg. here, tilylvailime Hens,' be begin, bold big one the Wick he held in ids band tem* the chief ; \" man =died* are one, eves ea tide stick is in any hand.\" With an e.teleatatien of impel:Here dytteeter snatebed the stick from the fipaqtel sod mapped , it awarder. \"SO much foe year unity I\" he enaleined. would have you break the band as quickly ea I have done your stick.\" self-satisfied chuckle. \" Stand out,Ambrose, and tell us of this tgrievons wrong, you have suffered.\" \"Aye, stand out., lad,\" urgedthe elder Berne. Stand otd, and let all hear of your wrong.\" \"Ima t bee whispering with a fellow of the flosvir; tribe, ar feDow Who was haspring round the camp for many a day,' began hose sullenly. \"Anght else?\" questioned the priest calmly. \"Aye, rennuM , the man. \"Fee a truth, I believe she has bewitched me, seeing that naught .has gone right with me of late. She answers me sullenly, cares nothing for being with me, and has, Immo my word, turned my veer child against Me.\" For a moment, as the man ceased speaking, 'there was silence; then. turning to die woman, who stood at fagl- , still holding Erclila dose against bee, the priest asked: \"What say - you to these charges? Speak, ' woman; 'his your only thence.\" \"They axe lies,\" the answered shortly. \"That is, I care for no man ; nor is it true that There cast the evil eye re him or his.\" \" She has confessed the half,\" exclaimed many present; yet the priest took no notice of their words, being apparently satisfied with the first part of the ceremony. Torpin. quickly . to the young men behind him, he made a sipti. at which one of their 'number led forward the mare, placing the end ' of the . halter in the old man's lund. With much mre, .as though the matter were a weighty one.\u2022 the priest corn' messed to draw a &ride round the spot on; which the animal stood. This over, he put his lips close to the mare's ear, and whispered ; certain words in his own tongue. I Now, all this while the young men were 'busily engaged in making what, appeared to be preparations for a ruse. Coats were thrown off quickly, heavy boots wens cost ride, while I those who wore long trousers rolled them up to I above the knee with great care. Soddenly the priest, having made an end of Ibis mysterious signs and whisperings, motioned to the people to clear an opening on the side where the ground sloped gently; then, without a word, he slipped the batter from the mare's bead and smote her with it over the haunches. Now, had the mare remained in the magic circle be bad drawn, for but a moment, our story had never been written, for then Orlando's innocence would have been proven. ,'Twos scarce likely, however, that a Itighbred mare conid suffer such en insult, and, with a bound, the animal was away, tearing down the lull with tail erect, long mane flowing in the I wind, secs pricked forward, and nostrils quivering with excitement; while behind her raced the Romany chile, foremost amongst them being Towne, well knowing that the only service I he could render to the forlorn woman on the summit of the hill was to catch the mare, which, for a moment, wan supposed to represent her, as quickly as possible. I A hater place from which to view the chase in the valley below could scarce have been chosen than the hill on which the people stood. From their vantage ground they could see the mare tearing along at almost. racing speed, while the chats, far too cunning to follow in her track, dispersed in all directions, jumping and racing like as many young colts, determined, if preible, to head the runaway. tall was a wild game to the casual spectator, of quaint - merriment, yet the watchers followed every movement, with bated breath. To them 'teas no mere idle pastime, for well they knew that a woman's fate\u2014perhaps her very lite\u2014depended I on the mare being caught are long. Twere idle for us to attempt to follow each incident, or to describe elf the trifling mishaps which betel the young men ere at length their work was aomenplishecL Sufficient, that after \u2022 weary chase the mare was at length centered and surrounded by the lads, one of whom crept forward, and after one ox two attempts sueandel in slipping the halter over her head.

It. was a strange procession that those baby eyes gazed upon with eac h amazement, strange even to the dawn, which wee slowiy creeputg over the fair landscape, lighting up the pur rid ple heather which covered the wild moorland, a casting a gentle glow of life over the stately hills, streaked here and there with bsibbling mountain brooks, that looked Calm naught so much as tiny streaks of burnished elm. Allywas w onderfully still, for the earth had hardl yet awwkened from repose. \u00b0ay here and thee the grouse were calling, atterng their strange greetings, as grouse are wont to do at break of day ; while m the distancea lark had already soared high tato the heavens, there to heist forth in a rapturous welcome to the god of light and loveliness.

But poorly clad, se , indeed. were most of those behind him, there was in his face and bearing a certaixt gravetii range nity well fitting one whose staff and m rams horn--the latter alnag loosely about his neck\u2014proclaimed him to be the *.h priest of powerful Romany tribe.. on Beh-.. him came a. wrembse of young men, eof whom lei by a rough hempen - bolter a young owe of sing es laxly perfect form and high breeding. Where or how the horse had been obtained it is not for us to inquire, though a stranger might well have wondered how poor gypsy folk came by so fate an animal . . Behind the groan, wall with an air determination, there came r. gipey man of middle sge. Ambrose Herne, Jr such was his name, was a man of tamp' malty powerful build; his strong, muscular form denoted one boat to be a leader ; while his face, framed in a man of black hair, which fell to his shoulders, might have been deemed handwrite save for the angry frown he wow. With hint there came a number of men of his own age end standing; while immediately behind ; awe followed a somewhat motley bond of Remap dials and cities, lads and lames more t fitted, one would have thought, to have danced et some gay marriage feast than to participate in the grim work before them. Be this as it ramv, the away chief who followed them, old ' . .:fer Herne, father of the man we have already mentioned, knew too well the value of i the warning they were about to receive than . to allow any of the younger members of the tribe to be absent. (Vic the...elder wenen and the children were allowed to remain in the ence: \"If the Romany rawnie, the wife, the mother the daughter, prove f fiale , , forget her duty, then the race is damned, the foandetiOM me shaken, and woe is come upon the greatest people on the earth.\" , This, perhaps the wisest doctrine of tint gipsy tri, the man would repeat; yet no sooner bad he done so than be would burst out into the most awful curses human lips could utter, screaming to the very Fewer he scaree acknowledged to damn with everlasting penktion the gipsy women who had lost - the love of-her husband. And so the scene of wild passion continues, while around on every side is naught save calm and loveliness. Faster and faster pour out the angry torrent of words; deeper and more awful grow the curses. Then of a sudden, without paaae on warning, the priest flashes a. lowbladed knife from his belt,. One instant it gleams through the air, the next , it is buried in the heart of the animal before them. A tlurll rased through the assembled crowd, yet the wild spectacle was as yet unfinished. Mackin out the knife and flinging it aside, Ithe priest caught up the hollowed ram's horn which hung about his neck and holding it to the wound he had inflicted watched it fill with blood. Then, lifting his arm on high, he I dashed the carnson. fluid over those about him, I yet, even es be did so, exhaumed nature setraid to give way, and the old mad aunt to the ground. In that mamma all the wild poach we have attempted to deem,* seemed to pas from the rpripat.. It may be that that inexplicable de. camp. And last of all came Orlando Berne, leading the con Ercilla. And they two were alone. No friend, if friend the had, cared to walk by the doomed woman's side; yet, in spite of her loneliness, irg spite of the startled, halffearful glances sbekesst around her, the young woman wore a steadfast look, such as one scarce expected to find int the face of one shortly to be cut off from her home and oast off front her people. Well was it for Ercilia that she was too young to know aught of the impart of the whole affair ; only she was hungry and not .little weary with the long enforced march. \"Mammy,\" the child murmured again, \" Fax-ilia is hungry. Won't we stop soon and light the fire l\" \"Aye, soon, little one,\" whispered the -wow& \"Ercilla must be brave.

TAM ZDITOR MILT INDRZKD Sir\u2014About a year ago the hisb University Fxlocation Question was the thief subject of public discuseion. It is likely soon again to force itself on public attention, but perhaps in a .11011 moderate and reasonable way. I have been recently engaged in looirMg into attain matters in connection with the Royal University, and have compiled some tables, which I think will be of gemersi interest to the Iris people. The Royal University has been an experiment on a large scale, and the public have now the advantage of learning the results. In the yaw 1831 tue Quotes University was dissolved, and the Royal University established. The following table shows the names of persons who obtained in chit year the degrees of 11.11. and di.A. reepectivelv 111 the Querns University and the colt-gee in which they were educated\u2014 M.D. B.A. Queen's College, Belfast 34 ......

Th. prepossi of Mr. Balfour to establish see- Jackie universities with non-sectarian names Ilia@ hen chance now of commending itself tom voiles of the kingdom than it had last y land I do not think that the present powerful I Govermnent could carry a measure to endow I even doacennational college',not to speak of universities. It might be worth while to try another plan. As the Government gave Local Government, to Ireland in municipad. _and county affairs, wthy not try it in a modified form for colleges? Make the governing bodies of the Queen's Colleges, so far as poritile, representative, and give the collegea a proper endowment. Cut them o ff from Government interference in their annagement, and so prevent this intrlgaing and wire-pulling. Let the people have a real inie s seet in the colleges, end then they would tare acrid. in them, and endeavour to advance their interests. The north of Ireland would have a Board to please itself, the west and south of Ireland the OASIS.. Under such conditions I see no reason why the Queen's Colleges of Belfast, Cork. and Galvray should not please all pertles, and attain A degree of usefulness and apositioe in science Ind literature of weidli Ireland might be proud. I do not see that any politician of any sort %hoover could reasonably object to Duc h it censure for reorganising the Queen's Coeges wet eutting them on a broad popular basis. If the principle were aecepted, the details could be arranged, and precedent+ axe not wanting. The governing board might contain eepresentatives of the teachers and of the era tuates, officeil representatives of some pu'hlie Oodles, and eminent persons in thorough syne , lathy with the Colleges. The Colleges on this den would really become what they should be. he people's Colleges. Whilst the Queen's' lelleges have been injured, and the teacherlive euffered serious lose by the establishment el the Royal University, I am pretty confident, iut I would not like to proph es y, that Uni+mite education of an excellent type will be nore 'widely extended than it ever could have teen under the old Queen's University, and hat the Queen's Colleges under local control, ed in harmony with the views, of the ecm. lenity, for who s e use they have been founded, \u2022ight easily develop into Colleges with reit. :mac, and all the advantages of residential 1 ...011ege life which some edueationalists prin. highly. There is no reason why, under low co ndi tions, the Colleges should not be pro, -idea with residential halls by private bone [ lrence. The Gover n ment will certainly never wovide such halls, and private persons are not kely to do so under any Cavernmeut mangement. I have purposely avoided dealing with the dedieal Faculty, which etas in a position ,alts different from the Arts/Faculty. Were the College& in the position they ought o he, then a re-erganisition of the Royal Uni\u2022 :mity, after the manner of the London Unieretty, might be eerieuely entertained. \u2014 Your :ledient servant, WILLIAM A.

The tables establish, 1 think, clearly several points. Ist. That all the Queen's Colleges have been mach impaired in their usefulness by the estab. l lathe:eat of the Royal University. sd. That the arts faculty in Cork has been ruined, and in Galway is not one-half what it used to be. 3rd. That the medical faculty in Cork is Omit half what it was, and in Galway destroyed. 4th. That both in arts and medicine the University College, Dubin, and Catholic University School of Medicine, notwithstanding their predominant position and influence, have failed to show the return of graduates, which really was expected by the Government in establishing the Royal University. In Mc: from that point- of new the Royal University has been a miserable failure. sth. From another point of view, however, the Boys,: University results are remarkable. In the three years tabulated no less than 252 out of a total of 420, who took the degree of 8.A., either studied in colleges or schools not associated with the University, or studied privately. I find that very many \" other col. leges and schools\" in Irei . said have sent students to various Arts Examinations of the University. For the First University Examination in arts is summer, 1899, there were 48; for the Second University Examination in arts, 32, and for the 8.A., 17 such institutions which sent students who passed the respective examinations. A considerable number of these colleges and schools have been brought into existence, or been given a great impetus by the Royal University. and have acquired a sort of vested right to degrees in arts by examination which Parliament cannot in justice ignore. I may remark that it would appear that the five colleges intimately associated with the University seem to be chiefly resorted to in arts by students desirous of cibtaining honours an-I prizes, whilst the other colleges and schools' am resorted to chiefly by those merely desirous of pass &vv.? The inference from this I wou.d draw :s that the three Queen's Colleges, the Catholic University College, and Magee &liege are recognised as university colleges devoted to higher study and research. The injury to the arts schools of the Queen's Colleges in relation to the number of students is mainly owing to the opening of the Arts degree to all comers and not to the constitution of the boards of examiners in the Royal University or the predominant influence of the Catholic University College, Dublin\u2014for the nuniber of private students and of students from other \"colleges and sebools\" who pass 'for the B.A. degree are one and a half times as great as that from all the privileged colleges put together. With a continuance of the present system there seems no reasonabfe probability that the Queen's Colleges will be any better in point of numbers in the future thanl in the past. In the Royal, as in other universities, the scholastic attaaunenta necessary to obtain a pass degree in arts are not of a ' very prohibitive character, and, no doubt, especially in the literary side of the Arts Faculty, very-many schools and colleges are quite ay . .] able to prepare efficiently students for the pass examinations. No doubt \" grinding\" prevails to a considerable extent, but that will always exist under say system. The control of the examinations is in the bands of examiners who are teachnu in the five colleges associated, with the University, and it is for them to so conduct the examinations as to make it difficult for -the \"crammed\" student to pass. It must be admitted that the Queen's Colleges are not well officered for the training of juniors and backward students. There are no tutors or assistant professors as there ought to be, and if the importance of the colleges is to be estimated by the number of students in arts, it will never come to be high unless by i'se alteration of University arrangements ant of the College organisation. The Queen's Cul. loges and Minder institutions of Univ.:say standing moat, regardless of the numoer of students, be looked upon, howeven, as of nations' importance in keeping up the standard of higher adoration, affording opportunity for original work and research, and living toms to the education of the country. Such institutions should be supported with no niggardly band; their acientifio tlepartments should be supplied with-leboratonee and appeasths without regard to cost, and chairs wed so kb* rally as to snake the professors independent of the fees obtained from voluntary theme. It is evident things cannot remain as they are. The Queen:s Colleges founded by the ' b 7 the Govern- Paving but scant heed to the words, the two, still iiolding hands, yet with the carcase of the, hone between them\u2022 recited a form of words; them walking with measured steps, tbey reached the tail of the s:angbtered brute. No further word was spoken, yet each one present leant forward to watch the angry swing Ambrose gave the woman's hand as their fingers parted for ever. Neither glanced to right or left, only as the hands pawed each turned from the other, and without speaking paced off in opposite directions. - 'Twas a strange parting, worthy of a strange people. For a while these two bad walked life's journey together \u2022 now that their roads were divided , neither would cheer the other on the way by one word or glance. To all appearances neither knew nor cared whither he or she ass going ; yet, if the truth were known, while the man's path would but lead I him back to his own encampment and people, none knew whither the woman's feet would lead her. . - - For a moment all stood watching the two in grim silence. Suddenly, however, the stillness was broken, as the child Ercilla, who up to now had crouched on the ground by Tawoc's side, sucking a small brown thumb contentedly enough., sprang to her feet with a bitter wail, \"Mammy, mammy!\" the cried. Yet, though the woman heard that wail, she dared act pause or turn in her path. Again the child was about to cry. when Temno, seized with.a, sudden idea, whispered, even while he trembled at his own boldness: \"After her, Emilia! Mammy's never coming hack again 1\" 'ryas all that was needed, for the next moment, ere any ((mid stop bee, the little one had started off down the hill in her mother's track, while a baby voice cried out shrilly : \" Stop, mammy, Mop! tunimae.\" \" Catch her !\" cried out the old chief ; and in a moment one of Aegean mein was in parsuit In truth, the man ran fast; yet the child had gained the start, and 'twas only when the little one was a few yards from her mother that she felt her muvuer ;lose behind, Mammy, mammy!\" the cried, \"they're catchin' Ercilla!\" _ _ Arid at that moment the watchers on the hill saw the divorced woman turn and snatch up the child in her strong tams. She was only just in time, for the nest instant the man was upon her, con her, as the watchers could see, to girt up her child. This they could see, as also they could distinguish the woman's almost majestic gesture of refusal ; and then the man, whom men were wont to deem a lard and cruel one, returned alone, while the woman could be seen as a speck in the distance, dill leading her little oue by the hand.

[central INewsa Te~egruna] RBEassBu, January 1 (1.30 p m. -General French continues to keep the enemy on the move. He pressed them closely on Saturday and Sunday, givinu them no time to make a prolonged stand. Last night all our cavalry and artillery and infantry, the latter riding in wagons to increase the general mobilitv of the advance, started upon a night march, with the object of turning the enemy's right flank. Thre operations were brilliantly successful. When * day broke we were in striking distance of the enemy. Our infantry and field batteries at once made a feint attack upon the Boer front, and while this was proceeding our cavalry and light artillery got round the enemy's right flank as arranged. The programme worked without a hitch. The Boers wvere utterly surprised, end finding their retreat threatened, they iled in disorder to the eastward, leaving Colesberg in our hands.0 THE ABANDONMENT OF ARUSDEL.

STAND AGAINST OVERWHELMING ODDS. A Times telegram from Steristroomn, dated Sun- lday, 5.Z p.m., ?? scouts in the dongha, south-west of Lbunes NeL-, about six miles north of Dordrecht, were cut off by the enemy last night, owing to tbeir refusal to leave a wounded officer of Lieu- tenant Warren Brabant's borse. These forty men, under Lieutenants Milford and Tamrer, of the F'rontier Mounted Rifles, defended themselves most gallantly against the repeated attacks of some 800 Boers. The enemy resorted to sniping defin thie night, renewing a heavy fire at davlight, but they were again repulsed with loss. At 5.15 this morning Captain Goldsworthy, bf the Cape Mounted Rfles, arrived from Dordrecht, with 115 men, and four guns. The enemy immediately fled to the hills. Mitford's party, who horses bad nearly all been killed or wounded, were then rescned, spare horses being led to their positon. Milford's party displayed splendid pluck, and the brilliant manner in which Captain Goldswvortby effected the relief, and his prompt action on his own responsi- - bilitv are deserving of the highest praise. Our loss is two wounded. The Boers lost about thirty, including eight killed: A VERY PRETTY FIGHT. THE WHITE FLAG DODGE. [Press Associaaion Times Telegram.] STLrmsvnoowr, December 31.-On my return this afternoon I found my telegram of this morning not i yet tbrough from DordrecEt, the wire having been blocked with official messages. Consequently, althou-b I was the only correspondent present at . the figit, my telegram has had no start. Lieutenant i Milford's party was cut off owing to an incorrect report received by Lieutenant De Montmorency, who was led to believe that the whole force was obeying his order to retire. The error was dis- covered too late for action the same evening. A very pretty fight resulted this - morning, when Captain Goldswortehy reached the eastern edge of the plateau. under the Boer position. Lieutenant De Montmorency and the scouts, loaded with quantities of ammunition, mounted the cliffs on the south side. Tne BLers at this time f, vere pressing heavily on LieBtenant thilford, siose awrmaestiong was running short. On the appearance of rein- forcements the Boers fled hastily, contenting them- selves with firing from the hills at long ranges. 'The party having been rescued and the whole front cleared, our- guns opened fire. The enemy replied, but without effeet, although it is noticeable that his shells all burst on percussion, instead of falling dead- The remainder of the force having withdrawn below the crest, the artillery followed. . That our loss was so slight is to be explained only by the bad shooting and poor courage shown by the enemy. The enemy tried the white flag with Lieutenant Milford without effect, while our reply to their usual volley killed two of them, including the bearer of the flag. The enemy crept down, and shot Lieutenant Milford's horses, for which there was no room in the-positioa he had taken up. They dared not, however, comne to close fighting with his men. The engagements yesterday and to-day were most creditable to our troops anld distinctly a reverse to the Boers. DISAFFECTETD COLONIAL DUTCH. ARMIED WITH ATAJSERS. [From the Dailt' 17 vf s SpeciaZ Corresvovdmt.] TAIBrnERG, December 30. - The district of Middelburg seems all quiet, and the whole extent of the rebellion appears to have been reached. Doubtless sympathf runs against the British, but the possibility of confiscation proves a sufficient deterrent to open disloyalty. The enemy is kept fully informed of every move- ment on our part, but only by further successful invasion does he seem likely to gain much acces- sion of strength from Cape Colony. I propose]: viewing General Gatacre's position and reporting I thereon before returning northwards, where the : I advance is likely to suffer some delay. -CsTo0ws, -.December 50 (5.15 ?? rumours are afloat regarding the disaffected Colonial Dutch. The Victoria West district is said to be seething with sedition, while every Dutchman in the Clanwilliara district is reported -to be armed with Mausers, and ready and anxious to use them on behalf of the\"Repubhcs. Theseand other treasonable symptoms emphasise the necessity and wisdom of retaining a large force to guard the lines of communication which ?? as much watching almost as if they ran through an enemy's country.

Several letters are printed drawing attention to the constantt landing of foreign recruits for the Boers at Delagon. Bay. The pleasant rains which have been falling over the whole of the Eastern Province have laid the troublesome dust and greatly increased the comfort of the troops. ?? companies are making arrangements to tender the moneys for licenses, which are due on January 1, through the banks, in order to avoid possible confiscation of their claims.

Senator Mas~on and other prominenti personages warel present. I Resolutios were enthusically adopted syp thising with the Transvaal and condening the war. Similar meetings were held in diferent cities in the west. According to a rdespatch from Burlington, Ver- mont, pulblishted by the gims, it is reported th~at the. Fenians are storing quan~tities of dynamite, lyddite,; ammelnition, and ?? in rem~ote districts of Vermnont and Maine, near the Canadian boundary. It is stated that a list is being prepared of farmers -who can furnish transport. Smell railways are being, studied, and places which could be easily captured are being located. Preparations, it is added, are in progress. The Wi=ne to-dav states that there is an under- standing between the representatives of the South African Republic and the heads of the Irish Physical Force Party for the despabch of members of the Irish volunteers to assist the Boers. A number . of men belonging to the Clan-na-Gael. are now J :n South Africa preparing to receive recruits. The order may send out, the journal adds, the volunteers which were organised in 1895 ander the Can-naGae]> in New York and other large cities for the purpose of taking advantage of any crisis in British affairs, and which were estimated to number 22,000 men.

Teleg am: NE-w Tonaz January 1.-The newspapers here are unanimous in condemning the meeting held by the Inish societies at the Academy of Music last night to declare sympathy with the Boers. The Eeeeiu. Post says: \"Irish demonstrations ?? are always in order -when England is in difilties. They can 'demonstrate' as inuch as they please so long as they avoid any overt act; but it does not follow that such meetings will not be without effect. Sympathy with the Boers is of sufficient importance in politics , to be 4 worth utlising iA the coming campaign. Neo genuine American is insane enough to think that we shall interfere.\"' The Adrerti.er declares that it is ihigh time to cell such demonstrations ?? instead of pro-Boer. The gathering, says this journal, was composed of Anarchists, Irish, and.aI- small element'who sympathise with the Boers in a. half-ashamed, apologetic way because they are the, smaller, although this element thoroughly well knows that the interests of the United States demand the success of the English. These sym- pathisers make much noise, but do no harm. . The ali4 a-d Express says that the sentiment expressed by a participant in the meeting,who inter- rupted the chief speaker while he wasreferring to Enasintegrity W~ith the ejacullation \"Shte's never right in anything,\" breathes hatred of England as the movimg cause in gatherimgs ostensibly con- troled by love of the Boers. This, says the Maiz, tends to utterly destroy the effectiveness of such. demonstrations. BOER AGENIzT IN HOLLAND.

A representative of the HanddsbHd who interviewed him endeavoured to ascertain the nature of his mission, bhut Comman- dant De Waard refused to give any information on the subject. It is almost certain, however, he has come to Europe to make purchases in Holland and Germany. He expressed confidence in the ultimate success of the Boees. He stated that the Transvaal hasan abundant supply of ammunition, especially Mauser cartridges, ahich are, moreover, now being manufactured at Pretoriea while shells are being made at Jobannesburg and in the railway factcries. He eulogised the qualhy of the German and French amamnition, the effect of which, he said, was terrible. THE CANADIAN CONINGENT.

Auroras, January I.-The Bishop of Patras having prohibited the holding of a mass for the repose of I souls of English soldiers and others who have fallen in the war in South Africa, the matter was to-day brooght up in the Chamber, and gave rise to an animated discussion. The Minister of Public Worship explained that the Bishop's prohibition was solely of a religious character, the Orthodne Greek i Church not allog any cremonies for those belong- ing to other faiths.' Several Deputies, however, protested against the Minister's view, and persisted that the pribihition partook of a political character. _.

RETURN OF INVAIMDS. Thirty-six military invalids, comprising sick and wounded from Natal, anived ?? yesterday afternoon on board the Castle liner Garth Castle, which altogether had sixty passengers on board. Consequentlythe wounded, who were accommodated in the second-class saloon, made the voyage under 1 most pleasant conditions. When they embarked at, Natal many of them presented a sorry spectacle, but, yesterday, with few exceptions, they lo;oked fit and well; in fact, several expressed themselves as being >ready to ave another rab at old Kruger. In response to an enquiry from the War Offlce, the committees of the various hospitals at Liverpool are marking arrangements by wvhich they hope to be able to place eighty to a hundred bedB at the dis- posal of wounded and inialid soldiers. The Duke of Portland writes--' I have applied to the auttboritles at Netley BospitaL and I am told that I game is very acceptable to the patients.

A couplesof supposed Boer Sties i were tdally enrolled, or about t6 be enrolled, wen their bsna fides came-intoguestion, and investigation led to the cutting short of their yeomanry career. There is a strong suspicion that the enterprising Dr. Leyds is at the botom. of the little plot. l is a admitted that suspicious circumstances have led to I the erercise of great care, aidall ?? officials eon- nected in any way with enrolment wvill keen a sharp look-out for ary candidates who' maj r. appear to be actuated by ulterior motives. The central authority is not yet in a position to give the total number of- enrolments at the difierent centres, or the aggregate of them all, but they areI quite-satisfied that giod progress is being made. Sir George Arthur, formerly -of the Life Guards, is N doing good service to the committee at the home Centre in the: way of receing- aud interrogating candidates and passing them on to the proper i ?? afhmni lsl e quarters .Each me is c y questioned as to his record, health, character, and ability to ride nd shoot well. Their replies are not taken. ontrus t but an actual test of their capabilities is arranged for. They are directed to their respective head- quarters for the riding and shooting te, and it is ' understood these will be most rignrous. An Evening News reporter went to Suffolk Street, I the headquarters of the new force, to make enquiries 4 in the matter. This is the stcry-thatwas told to bim a by the officer in charge :-\"What von have heard is f quite true. We are simply being pestered by thse fellows. There is not the least doubt-we hve bad official confirmation-that they come from Dr. Leyds. They say they have been in some colonial I troop-of horse, but it is easy enough to see through a most of them. Two of them, however, were actually a accepted; but luckily the first was denoun'ced c by his landlord as being one of the disloyal Cape r Dutch. The other one had attempted to steal an c officer's attestation paper, and so wae foundout. a The samething has happened in the case ofThorney- E croft's Horse, in which seven spies have been folnd and shot. We have given the wercd to all our com- mnanding officers to keep a sharp lookout for traitors.\" The Central Ne-ws says that no fewer than twenty- I five Boer emissaries tried to gain admission to the t force. Il all -but two. cases, after sharp cross- examination, they were turned away. The two were actuil-v enrolled, but were found oct before attesta- tion. It is believed on good grounds that this is the work of Dr. Leyds. Several men- came in speaking swith a decided Scandinavian accent. They saidt they were naturalised Englishmen, but could not produce their papers. Up to the presentnone of I these men have been imprisoned, the authorities con- tenting themslves with turning them away. All 2 the commissioned officershave been warned to keep I a keen look-out for Boer svmpathisers. The London Mail says: Boer spies have made many attemapts to get enrolled in the' Imperial yeomsnry~ning the laust few days. The committee hava oonseqnently seat notices to the various yecrnanrytbeadqlarters, warning officers to exercise more thani ordinary care in the selection of recruits. \"We have had several spies in this room,\" said a member of the committee yesterday to a DaiZy krail representative, \" and I think we have managed to detect every one of them. They have come here armed with letters of introduction from various people, and, after-asserting that the 1 are good hosemen and good shots, they have begged us to enrol them as members 'of the corps. How do we know they are spies I Well, for one thing, we have certain information that they were being sent' here by.- Dr. Leyds; E and, for another, we can easily tell an English- t man from a foreigner. In one instanee a I Boer spy came here and tried hard to obtain private information about the yeomanry, and he was promptly pat out into the street. Two men Iacbuallysucceeded in joiniug, but they were soon unmasked. One of them was denounced as being ai dsla Cape Dutchman'; and the others real purpose was discovered by an officer.\" Yesterday a number of volunteers were enrolled at -the yeomanry headquarters at Warwck for the Imperial Yeomanry. The Marquis of Hertford, who is in command of the county yeomanry during the illness of Colonel Lord Willoughby de Broke, was present, with several other officers. The volunteers were all men of fine physique, and mostly of the farmer class. The men of the Worcester and Dudley Squadrons of the Queen's Own Worceatershire Hussers who have volunteered for active service paraded yester- day at Worcester. There were forty-fi members of the Dudley Squadron, and nearly thirty of the Worcester Squadron. The men were measured for theirkhaki uniformls and boots, and arrangements have beena made for carbine practice. The first list of subscriptions to a fund started in Windsor for the Berkshire Yeomanry and soldiers, amounts to \u00a3854. A Berwickshire fund now stands at \u00a3-1,500. Promises representing the sum of about ;\u00a38,000 were made at a County meeting, at Winchester, yesterday, for the equipment of volunteers and yeomanry. At a meeting held at Welshpool last evening to enrol volunteers for the Imperial Yeomanry, up- wards of \u00a3800 was raised in the room, Sir Watlin Wynn (colonel of the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry) subsc-ibing \u00a3200 and Lord and Lady Powis \u00a310.

The squadron will mobilise on Thursday at Welslhpool Prepara- tions for billeting the men and horses are actively proceeding. Colonlel Forbes has presented' a Colt guan and galloping carriage to the squadron. At the mbedical inspection of the troopers of the Bucks Yeomaory who have volunteered for active service, yesterday, very few men were rejected.

Mrr Blatchford's brochure contains six chapters thoughtful, reflned, suggestive; and we can strongly commend the little work o the ?? Gmcrie, An excellent little book. Although a Unitarian minister, DMr Blatehford discusses the religious opinions of Shakespeare in such an impartial manner that the reader who occupies the most orthodox position will have little or nothing to complain ?? Heratl, Mr Blatehlford has rendered the student of Shakespeare a distinct service in having in the work before us given him no complete a collection of the studies in religion to be found In the great dramatist's works, and for a scholarly treatise upon their purpose and Inlluence.-Torquay Tivies This little pamphlet is wortlly of recommendation to students of Shakespearo, who will doubtless read it with pleasure, and derive from it fresh andproiitablethouglsts. Through all the writer's earnestness and delight in his sasbject is very evident, and adds a peculiar charm,- Ballt llrald. Mr Blatchford, whn has written this charming volume of essays, brings to beat on his subject evidences of scholarship and aA Intense admiration for the thought of the Bard of Avon. We congratulate Mr Blatcthford upon having culled such a helpful, scholarly, and fresh garland In a field o1 literature where so many have worked and dallied. This is a most delightful volume of Shakes- pearean ?? Tldies Daily Xcws. \" Studies in Religion from Shakespeare\" is by the Rev Ambrose Blatehiord, whose natural eloquence, keen appreciation of the beautiful in thought and form, and loving knowledge of Shakespeare eminently fit him for so interesting a task, His obvious enthuslasm, and his glowing and picturesque language must rivet tlhe atten- :ion, and transmit his own appreciation.- Westetr Dwdi Press. When the poet wakes our souls to the Call of inspiring thought, says Mr Ambrose N. Blatehford, author of a little volume of \"Studies in Religion Irom Shakespeare,\" we care little what creed or system claims such genius as its own; the humanity of it covers the whole ground; we are reverently thankful for the Influence that touches our hearts. In this spirit he has endeavoured to deal wit ?? subject, while at the same timue emplhaslsing soine of the leading influences that must haveaffeetedtlhegreat dramatist from the circumstances of the time in which his lot was cast, and somue of the principal moral and religious lessons set forth in Lis ??
